CHAPTER I

On an exceptionally hot evening early in July a young man came out of
the garret in which he lodged in S. Place and walked slowly, as though
in hesitation, towards K. bridge."
He had successfully avoided meeting his landlady on the staircase.
"His
garret was under the roof of a high, five-storied house and was more
like a cupboard than a room."
"The landlady who provided him with garret,
dinners, and attendance, lived on the floor below, and every time
he went out he was obliged to pass her kitchen, the door of which
invariably stood open."
"And each time he passed, the young man had a
sick, frightened feeling, which made him scowl and feel ashamed."
"He was
hopelessly in debt to his landlady, and was afraid of meeting her."
"This was not because he was cowardly and abject, quite the contrary; but
for some time past he had been in an overstrained irritable condition,
verging on hypochondria."
"He had become so completely absorbed in
himself, and isolated from his fellows that he dreaded meeting, not
only his landlady, but anyone at all."
"He was crushed by poverty, but the
anxieties of his position had of late ceased to weigh upon him."
"He had
given up attending to matters of practical importance; he had lost all
desire to do so."
"Nothing that any landlady could do had a real terror
for him."
"But to be stopped on the stairs, to be forced to listen to her
trivial, irrelevant gossip, to pestering demands for payment, threats
and complaints, and to rack his brains for excuses, to prevaricate, to
lie--no, rather than that, he would creep down the stairs like a cat and
slip out unseen."
"This evening, however, on coming out into the street, he became acutely
aware of his fears."
"“I want to attempt a thing _like that_ and am frightened by these
trifles,” he thought, with an odd smile."
"“Hm... yes, all is in a man’s
hands and he lets it all slip from cowardice, that’s an axiom."
"It would
be interesting to know what it is men are most afraid of."
"Taking a new
step, uttering a new word is what they fear most...."
"But I am talking
too much."
It’s because I chatter that I do nothing.
"Or perhaps it is
that I chatter because I do nothing."
"I’ve learned to chatter this
last month, lying for days together in my den thinking... of Jack the
Giant-killer."
Why am I going there now?
Am I capable of _that_?
"Is
_that_ serious?"
It is not serious at all.
"It’s simply a fantasy to amuse
myself; a plaything!"
"Yes, maybe it is a plaything.”

The heat in the street was terrible: and the airlessness, the bustle
and the plaster, scaffolding, bricks, and dust all about him, and that
special Petersburg stench, so familiar to all who are unable to get out
of town in summer--all worked painfully upon the young man’s already
overwrought nerves."
"The insufferable stench from the pot-houses, which
are particularly numerous in that part of the town, and the drunken men
whom he met continually, although it was a working day, completed
the revolting misery of the picture."
"An expression of the profoundest
disgust gleamed for a moment in the young man’s refined face."
"He was,
by the way, exceptionally handsome, above the average in height, slim,
well-built, with beautiful dark eyes and dark brown hair."
"Soon he sank
into deep thought, or more accurately speaking into a complete blankness
of mind; he walked along not observing what was about him and not caring
to observe it."
"From time to time, he would mutter something, from the
habit of talking to himself, to which he had just confessed."
"At these
moments he would become conscious that his ideas were sometimes in a
tangle and that he was very weak; for two days he had scarcely tasted
food."
"He was so badly dressed that even a man accustomed to shabbiness would
have been ashamed to be seen in the street in such rags."
"In that quarter
of the town, however, scarcely any shortcoming in dress would have
created surprise."
"Owing to the proximity of the Hay Market, the number
of establishments of bad character, the preponderance of the trading
and working class population crowded in these streets and alleys in the
heart of Petersburg, types so various were to be seen in the streets
that no figure, however queer, would have caused surprise."
"But there was
such accumulated bitterness and contempt in the young man’s heart, that,
in spite of all the fastidiousness of youth, he minded his rags least
of all in the street."
"It was a different matter when he met with
acquaintances or with former fellow students, whom, indeed, he disliked
meeting at any time."
"And yet when a drunken man who, for some unknown
reason, was being taken somewhere in a huge waggon dragged by a heavy
dray horse, suddenly shouted at him as he drove past: “Hey there, German
hatter” bawling at the top of his voice and pointing at him--the young
man stopped suddenly and clutched tremulously at his hat."
"It was a tall
round hat from Zimmerman’s, but completely worn out, rusty with age, all
torn and bespattered, brimless and bent on one side in a most unseemly
fashion."
"Not shame, however, but quite another feeling akin to terror
had overtaken him."
"“I knew it,” he muttered in confusion, “I thought so!"
"That’s the worst
of all!"
"Why, a stupid thing like this, the most trivial detail might
spoil the whole plan."
"Yes, my hat is too noticeable...."
"It looks absurd
and that makes it noticeable.... With my rags I ought to wear a cap, any
sort of old pancake, but not this grotesque thing."
"Nobody wears such
a hat, it would be noticed a mile off, it would be remembered.... What
matters is that people would remember it, and that would give them
a clue."
"For this business one should be as little conspicuous as
possible.... Trifles, trifles are what matter!"
"Why, it’s just such
trifles that always ruin everything....”

He had not far to go; he knew indeed how many steps it was from the gate
of his lodging house: exactly seven hundred and thirty."
"He had counted
them once when he had been lost in dreams."
"At the time he had put no
faith in those dreams and was only tantalising himself by their hideous
but daring recklessness."
"Now, a month later, he had begun to look upon
them differently, and, in spite of the monologues in which he jeered at
his own impotence and indecision, he had involuntarily come to regard
this “hideous” dream as an exploit to be attempted, although he
still did not realise this himself."
"He was positively going now for a
“rehearsal” of his project, and at every step his excitement grew more
and more violent."
"With a sinking heart and a nervous tremor, he went up to a huge house
which on one side looked on to the canal, and on the other into the
street."
"This house was let out in tiny tenements and was inhabited by
working people of all kinds--tailors, locksmiths, cooks, Germans of
sorts, girls picking up a living as best they could, petty clerks, etc."
"There was a continual coming and going through the two gates and in the
two courtyards of the house."
"Three or four door-keepers were employed on
the building."
"The young man was very glad to meet none of them, and
at once slipped unnoticed through the door on the right, and up the
staircase."
"It was a back staircase, dark and narrow, but he was familiar
with it already, and knew his way, and he liked all these surroundings:
in such darkness even the most inquisitive eyes were not to be dreaded."
"“If I am so scared now, what would it be if it somehow came to pass that
I were really going to do it?” he could not help asking himself as he
reached the fourth storey."
"There his progress was barred by some porters
who were engaged in moving furniture out of a flat."
"He knew that the
flat had been occupied by a German clerk in the civil service, and his
family."
"This German was moving out then, and so the fourth floor on this
staircase would be untenanted except by the old woman."
"“That’s a good
thing anyway,” he thought to himself, as he rang the bell of the old
woman’s flat."
"The bell gave a faint tinkle as though it were made of
tin and not of copper."
"The little flats in such houses always have bells
that ring like that."
"He had forgotten the note of that bell, and now
its peculiar tinkle seemed to remind him of something and to bring it
clearly before him...."
"He started, his nerves were terribly overstrained
by now."
"In a little while, the door was opened a tiny crack: the old
woman eyed her visitor with evident distrust through the crack, and
nothing could be seen but her little eyes, glittering in the darkness."
"But, seeing a number of people on the landing, she grew bolder, and
opened the door wide."
"The young man stepped into the dark entry, which
was partitioned off from the tiny kitchen."
"The old woman stood facing
him in silence and looking inquiringly at him."
"She was a diminutive,
withered up old woman of sixty, with sharp malignant eyes and a sharp
little nose."
"Her colourless, somewhat grizzled hair was thickly smeared
with oil, and she wore no kerchief over it."
"Round her thin long neck,
which looked like a hen’s leg, was knotted some sort of flannel rag,
and, in spite of the heat, there hung flapping on her shoulders, a mangy
fur cape, yellow with age."
"The old woman coughed and groaned at every
instant."
"The young man must have looked at her with a rather peculiar
expression, for a gleam of mistrust came into her eyes again."
"“Raskolnikov, a student, I came here a month ago,” the young man made
haste to mutter, with a half bow, remembering that he ought to be more
polite."
"“I remember, my good sir, I remember quite well your coming here,” the
old woman said distinctly, still keeping her inquiring eyes on his face."
“And here...
"I am again on the same errand,” Raskolnikov continued, a
little disconcerted and surprised at the old woman’s mistrust."
"“Perhaps
she is always like that though, only I did not notice it the other
time,” he thought with an uneasy feeling."
"The old woman paused, as though hesitating; then stepped on one side,
and pointing to the door of the room, she said, letting her visitor pass
in front of her:

“Step in, my good sir.”

The little room into which the young man walked, with yellow paper on
the walls, geraniums and muslin curtains in the windows, was brightly
lighted up at that moment by the setting sun."
"“So the sun will shine like this _then_ too!” flashed as it were by
chance through Raskolnikov’s mind, and with a rapid glance he scanned
everything in the room, trying as far as possible to notice and
remember its arrangement."
But there was nothing special in the room.
"The
furniture, all very old and of yellow wood, consisted of a sofa with
a huge bent wooden back, an oval table in front of the sofa, a
dressing-table with a looking-glass fixed on it between the windows,
chairs along the walls and two or three half-penny prints in yellow
frames, representing German damsels with birds in their hands--that was
all."
In the corner a light was burning before a small ikon.
"Everything
was very clean; the floor and the furniture were brightly polished;
everything shone."
"“Lizaveta’s work,” thought the young man."
"There was not a speck of dust
to be seen in the whole flat."
"“It’s in the houses of spiteful old widows that one finds such
cleanliness,” Raskolnikov thought again, and he stole a curious glance
at the cotton curtain over the door leading into another tiny room, in
which stood the old woman’s bed and chest of drawers and into which he
had never looked before."
These two rooms made up the whole flat.
"“What do you want?” the old woman said severely, coming into the room
and, as before, standing in front of him so as to look him straight in
the face."
"“I’ve brought something to pawn here,” and he drew out of his pocket
an old-fashioned flat silver watch, on the back of which was engraved a
globe; the chain was of steel."
“But the time is up for your last pledge.
"The month was up the day
before yesterday.”

“I will bring you the interest for another month; wait a little.”

“But that’s for me to do as I please, my good sir, to wait or to sell
your pledge at once.”

“How much will you give me for the watch, Alyona Ivanovna?”

“You come with such trifles, my good sir, it’s scarcely worth anything."
"I gave you two roubles last time for your ring and one could buy it
quite new at a jeweler’s for a rouble and a half.”

“Give me four roubles for it, I shall redeem it, it was my father’s."
"I
shall be getting some money soon.”

“A rouble and a half, and interest in advance, if you like!”

“A rouble and a half!” cried the young man."
“Please yourself”--and the old woman handed him back the watch.
"The
young man took it, and was so angry that he was on the point of going
away; but checked himself at once, remembering that there was nowhere
else he could go, and that he had had another object also in coming."
"“Hand it over,” he said roughly."
"The old woman fumbled in her pocket for her keys, and disappeared behind
the curtain into the other room."
"The young man, left standing alone in
the middle of the room, listened inquisitively, thinking."
"He could hear
her unlocking the chest of drawers."
"“It must be the top drawer,” he reflected."
"“So she carries the keys in
a pocket on the right."
"All in one bunch on a steel ring.... And there’s
one key there, three times as big as all the others, with deep notches;
that can’t be the key of the chest of drawers... then there must be some
other chest or strong-box... that’s worth knowing."
"Strong-boxes always
have keys like that... but how degrading it all is.”

The old woman came back."
"“Here, sir: as we say ten copecks the rouble a month, so I must take
fifteen copecks from a rouble and a half for the month in advance."
"But
for the two roubles I lent you before, you owe me now twenty copecks
on the same reckoning in advance."
"That makes thirty-five copecks
altogether."
"So I must give you a rouble and fifteen copecks for the
watch."
"Here it is.”

“What!"
"only a rouble and fifteen copecks now!”

“Just so.”

The young man did not dispute it and took the money."
"He looked at the
old woman, and was in no hurry to get away, as though there was still
something he wanted to say or to do, but he did not himself quite know
what."
"“I may be bringing you something else in a day or two, Alyona
Ivanovna--a valuable thing--silver--a cigarette-box, as soon as I get it
back from a friend...” he broke off in confusion."
"“Well, we will talk about it then, sir.”

“Good-bye--are you always at home alone, your sister is not here with
you?” He asked her as casually as possible as he went out into the
passage."
"“What business is she of yours, my good sir?”

“Oh, nothing particular, I simply asked."
"You are too quick.... Good-day,
Alyona Ivanovna.”

Raskolnikov went out in complete confusion."
"This confusion became more
and more intense."
"As he went down the stairs, he even stopped short, two
or three times, as though suddenly struck by some thought."
"When he was
in the street he cried out, “Oh, God, how loathsome it all is!"
"and
can I, can I possibly.... No, it’s nonsense, it’s rubbish!” he added
resolutely."
“And how could such an atrocious thing come into my head?
What filthy things my heart is capable of.
"Yes, filthy above all,
disgusting, loathsome, loathsome!--and for a whole month I’ve been....”
 But no words, no exclamations, could express his agitation."
"The feeling
of intense repulsion, which had begun to oppress and torture his heart
while he was on his way to the old woman, had by now reached such a
pitch and had taken such a definite form that he did not know what to
do with himself to escape from his wretchedness."
"He walked along the
pavement like a drunken man, regardless of the passers-by, and jostling
against them, and only came to his senses when he was in the next
street."
"Looking round, he noticed that he was standing close to a tavern
which was entered by steps leading from the pavement to the basement."
"At that instant two drunken men came out at the door, and abusing and
supporting one another, they mounted the steps."
"Without stopping to
think, Raskolnikov went down the steps at once."
"Till that moment he had
never been into a tavern, but now he felt giddy and was tormented by a
burning thirst."
"He longed for a drink of cold beer, and attributed his
sudden weakness to the want of food."
"He sat down at a sticky little
table in a dark and dirty corner; ordered some beer, and eagerly drank
off the first glassful."
"At once he felt easier; and his thoughts became
clear."
"“All that’s nonsense,” he said hopefully, “and there is nothing in it
all to worry about!"
It’s simply physical derangement.
"Just a glass of
beer, a piece of dry bread--and in one moment the brain is stronger,
the mind is clearer and the will is firm!"
"Phew, how utterly petty it all
is!”

But in spite of this scornful reflection, he was by now looking cheerful
as though he were suddenly set free from a terrible burden: and he gazed
round in a friendly way at the people in the room."
"But even at that
moment he had a dim foreboding that this happier frame of mind was also
not normal."
There were few people at the time in the tavern.
"Besides the two drunken
men he had met on the steps, a group consisting of about five men and
a girl with a concertina had gone out at the same time."
"Their departure
left the room quiet and rather empty."
"The persons still in the tavern
were a man who appeared to be an artisan, drunk, but not extremely so,
sitting before a pot of beer, and his companion, a huge, stout man with
a grey beard, in a short full-skirted coat."
"He was very drunk: and had
dropped asleep on the bench; every now and then, he began as though in
his sleep, cracking his fingers, with his arms wide apart and the upper
part of his body bounding about on the bench, while he hummed some
meaningless refrain, trying to recall some such lines as these:

   “His wife a year he fondly loved
    His wife a--a year he--fondly loved.”

Or suddenly waking up again:

   “Walking along the crowded row
    He met the one he used to know.”

But no one shared his enjoyment: his silent companion looked with
positive hostility and mistrust at all these manifestations."
"There was
another man in the room who looked somewhat like a retired government
clerk."
"He was sitting apart, now and then sipping from his pot and
looking round at the company."
"He, too, appeared to be in some agitation."
"CHAPTER II

Raskolnikov was not used to crowds, and, as we said before, he avoided
society of every sort, more especially of late."
"But now all at once he
felt a desire to be with other people."
"Something new seemed to be taking
place within him, and with it he felt a sort of thirst for company."
"He
was so weary after a whole month of concentrated wretchedness and gloomy
excitement that he longed to rest, if only for a moment, in some other
world, whatever it might be; and, in spite of the filthiness of the
surroundings, he was glad now to stay in the tavern."
"The master of the establishment was in another room, but he frequently
came down some steps into the main room, his jaunty, tarred boots with
red turn-over tops coming into view each time before the rest of his
person."
"He wore a full coat and a horribly greasy black satin waistcoat,
with no cravat, and his whole face seemed smeared with oil like an
iron lock."
"At the counter stood a boy of about fourteen, and there was
another boy somewhat younger who handed whatever was wanted."
"On the
counter lay some sliced cucumber, some pieces of dried black bread, and
some fish, chopped up small, all smelling very bad."
"It was insufferably
close, and so heavy with the fumes of spirits that five minutes in such
an atmosphere might well make a man drunk."
"There are chance meetings with strangers that interest us from the
first moment, before a word is spoken."
"Such was the impression made on
Raskolnikov by the person sitting a little distance from him, who looked
like a retired clerk."
"The young man often recalled this impression
afterwards, and even ascribed it to presentiment."
"He looked repeatedly
at the clerk, partly no doubt because the latter was staring
persistently at him, obviously anxious to enter into conversation."
"At
the other persons in the room, including the tavern-keeper, the clerk
looked as though he were used to their company, and weary of it, showing
a shade of condescending contempt for them as persons of station and
culture inferior to his own, with whom it would be useless for him to
converse."
"He was a man over fifty, bald and grizzled, of medium height,
and stoutly built."
"His face, bloated from continual drinking, was of
a yellow, even greenish, tinge, with swollen eyelids out of which keen
reddish eyes gleamed like little chinks."
"But there was something very
strange in him; there was a light in his eyes as though of intense
feeling--perhaps there were even thought and intelligence, but at the
same time there was a gleam of something like madness."
"He was wearing an
old and hopelessly ragged black dress coat, with all its buttons missing
except one, and that one he had buttoned, evidently clinging to this
last trace of respectability."
"A crumpled shirt front, covered with spots
and stains, protruded from his canvas waistcoat."
"Like a clerk, he wore
no beard, nor moustache, but had been so long unshaven that his chin
looked like a stiff greyish brush."
"And there was something respectable
and like an official about his manner too."
"But he was restless; he
ruffled up his hair and from time to time let his head drop into his
hands dejectedly resting his ragged elbows on the stained and sticky
table."
"At last he looked straight at Raskolnikov, and said loudly and
resolutely:

“May I venture, honoured sir, to engage you in polite conversation?"
"Forasmuch as, though your exterior would not command respect, my
experience admonishes me that you are a man of education and not
accustomed to drinking."
"I have always respected education when in
conjunction with genuine sentiments, and I am besides a titular
counsellor in rank."
Marmeladov--such is my name; titular counsellor.
"I
make bold to inquire--have you been in the service?”

“No, I am studying,” answered the young man, somewhat surprised at
the grandiloquent style of the speaker and also at being so directly
addressed."
"In spite of the momentary desire he had just been feeling for
company of any sort, on being actually spoken to he felt immediately his
habitual irritable and uneasy aversion for any stranger who approached
or attempted to approach him."
"“A student then, or formerly a student,” cried the clerk."
"“Just what
I thought!"
"I’m a man of experience, immense experience, sir,” and he
tapped his forehead with his fingers in self-approval."
"“You’ve been a
student or have attended some learned institution!..."
"But allow me....”
 He got up, staggered, took up his jug and glass, and sat down beside
the young man, facing him a little sideways."
"He was drunk, but spoke
fluently and boldly, only occasionally losing the thread of his
sentences and drawling his words."
"He pounced upon Raskolnikov as
greedily as though he too had not spoken to a soul for a month."
"“Honoured sir,” he began almost with solemnity, “poverty is not a vice,
that’s a true saying."
"Yet I know too that drunkenness is not a virtue,
and that that’s even truer."
"But beggary, honoured sir, beggary is a
vice."
"In poverty you may still retain your innate nobility of soul, but
in beggary--never--no one."
"For beggary a man is not chased out of human
society with a stick, he is swept out with a broom, so as to make it as
humiliating as possible; and quite right, too, forasmuch as in beggary
I am ready to be the first to humiliate myself."
Hence the pot-house!
"Honoured sir, a month ago Mr. Lebeziatnikov gave my wife a beating, and
my wife is a very different matter from me!"
Do you understand?
"Allow me
to ask you another question out of simple curiosity: have you ever spent
a night on a hay barge, on the Neva?”

“No, I have not happened to,” answered Raskolnikov."
"“What do you mean?”

“Well, I’ve just come from one and it’s the fifth night I’ve slept
so....” He filled his glass, emptied it and paused."
"Bits of hay were in
fact clinging to his clothes and sticking to his hair."
"It seemed quite
probable that he had not undressed or washed for the last five days."
"His hands, particularly, were filthy."
"They were fat and red, with black
nails."
His conversation seemed to excite a general though languid interest.
"The
boys at the counter fell to sniggering."
"The innkeeper came down from the
upper room, apparently on purpose to listen to the “funny fellow”
 and sat down at a little distance, yawning lazily, but with dignity."
"Evidently Marmeladov was a familiar figure here, and he had most
likely acquired his weakness for high-flown speeches from the habit of
frequently entering into conversation with strangers of all sorts in
the tavern."
"This habit develops into a necessity in some drunkards, and
especially in those who are looked after sharply and kept in order
at home."
"Hence in the company of other drinkers they try to justify
themselves and even if possible obtain consideration."
“Funny fellow!” pronounced the innkeeper.
"“And why don’t you work, why
aren’t you at your duty, if you are in the service?”

“Why am I not at my duty, honoured sir,” Marmeladov went on, addressing
himself exclusively to Raskolnikov, as though it had been he who put
that question to him."
“Why am I not at my duty?
"Does not my heart ache
to think what a useless worm I am?"
"A month ago when Mr. Lebeziatnikov
beat my wife with his own hands, and I lay drunk, didn’t I suffer?"
"Excuse me, young man, has it ever happened to you... hm... well, to
petition hopelessly for a loan?”

“Yes, it has."
"But what do you mean by hopelessly?”

“Hopelessly in the fullest sense, when you know beforehand that you
will get nothing by it."
"You know, for instance, beforehand with positive
certainty that this man, this most reputable and exemplary citizen, will
on no consideration give you money; and indeed I ask you why should he?"
For he knows of course that I shan’t pay it back.
From compassion?
"But
Mr. Lebeziatnikov who keeps up with modern ideas explained the other day
that compassion is forbidden nowadays by science itself, and that that’s
what is done now in England, where there is political economy."
"Why, I
ask you, should he give it to me?"
"And yet though I know beforehand that
he won’t, I set off to him and...”

“Why do you go?” put in Raskolnikov."
"“Well, when one has no one, nowhere else one can go!"
"For every man must
have somewhere to go."
"Since there are times when one absolutely must
go somewhere!"
"When my own daughter first went out with a yellow ticket,
then I had to go... (for my daughter has a yellow passport),” he added
in parenthesis, looking with a certain uneasiness at the young man."
"“No matter, sir, no matter!” he went on hurriedly and with apparent
composure when both the boys at the counter guffawed and even the
innkeeper smiled--“No matter, I am not confounded by the wagging of
their heads; for everyone knows everything about it already, and all
that is secret is made open."
"And I accept it all, not with contempt, but
with humility."
So be it!
So be it!
"‘Behold the man!’ Excuse me, young
man, can you.... No, to put it more strongly and more distinctly; not
_can_ you but _dare_ you, looking upon me, assert that I am not a pig?”

The young man did not answer a word."
"“Well,” the orator began again stolidly and with even increased dignity,
after waiting for the laughter in the room to subside."
"“Well, so be
it, I am a pig, but she is a lady!"
"I have the semblance of a beast, but
Katerina Ivanovna, my spouse, is a person of education and an officer’s
daughter."
"Granted, granted, I am a scoundrel, but she is a woman of a
noble heart, full of sentiments, refined by education."
"And yet... oh,
if only she felt for me!"
"Honoured sir, honoured sir, you know every man
ought to have at least one place where people feel for him!"
"But Katerina
Ivanovna, though she is magnanimous, she is unjust.... And yet, although
I realise that when she pulls my hair she only does it out of pity--for
I repeat without being ashamed, she pulls my hair, young man,” he
declared with redoubled dignity, hearing the sniggering again--“but, my
God, if she would but once...."
"But no, no!"
"It’s all in vain and it’s no
use talking!"
No use talking!
"For more than once, my wish did come true
and more than once she has felt for me but... such is my fate and I am a
beast by nature!”

“Rather!” assented the innkeeper yawning."
"Marmeladov struck his fist
resolutely on the table."
“Such is my fate!
"Do you know, sir, do you know, I have sold her very
stockings for drink?"
"Not her shoes--that would be more or less in the
order of things, but her stockings, her stockings I have sold for drink!"
"Her mohair shawl I sold for drink, a present to her long ago, her own
property, not mine; and we live in a cold room and she caught cold this
winter and has begun coughing and spitting blood too."
"We have three
little children and Katerina Ivanovna is at work from morning till
night; she is scrubbing and cleaning and washing the children, for she’s
been used to cleanliness from a child."
"But her chest is weak and she has
a tendency to consumption and I feel it!"
Do you suppose I don’t feel it?
And the more I drink the more I feel it.
That’s why I drink too.
"I try
to find sympathy and feeling in drink...."
"I drink so that I may suffer
twice as much!” And as though in despair he laid his head down on the
table."
"“Young man,” he went on, raising his head again, “in your face I seem to
read some trouble of mind."
"When you came in I read it, and that was why
I addressed you at once."
"For in unfolding to you the story of my life, I
do not wish to make myself a laughing-stock before these idle listeners,
who indeed know all about it already, but I am looking for a man
of feeling and education."
"Know then that my wife was educated in a
high-class school for the daughters of noblemen, and on leaving she
danced the shawl dance before the governor and other personages for
which she was presented with a gold medal and a certificate of merit."
"The medal... well, the medal of course was sold--long ago, hm... but the
certificate of merit is in her trunk still and not long ago she showed
it to our landlady."
"And although she is most continually on bad terms
with the landlady, yet she wanted to tell someone or other of her past
honours and of the happy days that are gone."
"I don’t condemn her for
it, I don’t blame her, for the one thing left her is recollection of
the past, and all the rest is dust and ashes."
"Yes, yes, she is a lady
of spirit, proud and determined."
"She scrubs the floors herself and has
nothing but black bread to eat, but won’t allow herself to be treated
with disrespect."
"That’s why she would not overlook Mr. Lebeziatnikov’s
rudeness to her, and so when he gave her a beating for it, she took to
her bed more from the hurt to her feelings than from the blows."
"She was
a widow when I married her, with three children, one smaller than the
other."
"She married her first husband, an infantry officer, for love, and
ran away with him from her father’s house."
"She was exceedingly fond of
her husband; but he gave way to cards, got into trouble and with that he
died."
"He used to beat her at the end: and although she paid him back, of
which I have authentic documentary evidence, to this day she speaks of
him with tears and she throws him up to me; and I am glad, I am glad
that, though only in imagination, she should think of herself as having
once been happy.... And she was left at his death with three children in
a wild and remote district where I happened to be at the time; and she
was left in such hopeless poverty that, although I have seen many ups
and downs of all sort, I don’t feel equal to describing it even."
"Her
relations had all thrown her off."
"And she was proud, too, excessively
proud.... And then, honoured sir, and then, I, being at the time a
widower, with a daughter of fourteen left me by my first wife, offered
her my hand, for I could not bear the sight of such suffering."
"You can
judge the extremity of her calamities, that she, a woman of education
and culture and distinguished family, should have consented to be my
wife."
But she did!
"Weeping and sobbing and wringing her hands, she
married me!"
For she had nowhere to turn!
"Do you understand, sir, do you
understand what it means when you have absolutely nowhere to turn?"
"No,
that you don’t understand yet.... And for a whole year, I performed
my duties conscientiously and faithfully, and did not touch this” (he
tapped the jug with his finger), “for I have feelings."
"But even so, I
could not please her; and then I lost my place too, and that through no
fault of mine but through changes in the office; and then I did touch
it!..."
"It will be a year and a half ago soon since we found ourselves at
last after many wanderings and numerous calamities in this magnificent
capital, adorned with innumerable monuments."
"Here I obtained a
situation...."
I obtained it and I lost it again.
Do you understand?
"This
time it was through my own fault I lost it: for my weakness had come
out.... We have now part of a room at Amalia Fyodorovna Lippevechsel’s;
and what we live upon and what we pay our rent with, I could not say."
There are a lot of people living there besides ourselves.
"Dirt and
disorder, a perfect Bedlam... hm... yes... And meanwhile my daughter by
my first wife has grown up; and what my daughter has had to put up with
from her step-mother whilst she was growing up, I won’t speak of."
"For,
though Katerina Ivanovna is full of generous feelings, she is a spirited
lady, irritable and short-tempered...."
Yes.
"But it’s no use going over
that!"
"Sonia, as you may well fancy, has had no education."
"I did make an
effort four years ago to give her a course of geography and universal
history, but as I was not very well up in those subjects myself and we
had no suitable books, and what books we had... hm, anyway we have not
even those now, so all our instruction came to an end."
"We stopped at
Cyrus of Persia."
"Since she has attained years of maturity, she has read
other books of romantic tendency and of late she had read with great
interest a book she got through Mr. Lebeziatnikov, Lewes’ Physiology--do
you know it?--and even recounted extracts from it to us: and that’s the
whole of her education."
"And now may I venture to address you, honoured
sir, on my own account with a private question."
"Do you suppose that
a respectable poor girl can earn much by honest work?"
"Not fifteen
farthings a day can she earn, if she is respectable and has no special
talent and that without putting her work down for an instant!"
"And what’s
more, Ivan Ivanitch Klopstock the civil counsellor--have you heard of
him?--has not to this day paid her for the half-dozen linen shirts she
made him and drove her roughly away, stamping and reviling her, on the
pretext that the shirt collars were not made like the pattern and were
put in askew."
"And there are the little ones hungry.... And Katerina
Ivanovna walking up and down and wringing her hands, her cheeks flushed
red, as they always are in that disease: ‘Here you live with us,’ says
she, ‘you eat and drink and are kept warm and you do nothing to help.’
And much she gets to eat and drink when there is not a crust for the
little ones for three days!"
"I was lying at the time... well, what of
it!"
"I was lying drunk and I heard my Sonia speaking (she is a gentle
creature with a soft little voice... fair hair and such a pale, thin
little face)."
"She said: ‘Katerina Ivanovna, am I really to do a thing
like that?’ And Darya Frantsovna, a woman of evil character and very
well known to the police, had two or three times tried to get at her
through the landlady."
"‘And why not?’ said Katerina Ivanovna with a jeer,
‘you are something mighty precious to be so careful of!’ But don’t blame
her, don’t blame her, honoured sir, don’t blame her!"
"She was not herself
when she spoke, but driven to distraction by her illness and the crying
of the hungry children; and it was said more to wound her than anything
else.... For that’s Katerina Ivanovna’s character, and when children
cry, even from hunger, she falls to beating them at once."
"At six o’clock
I saw Sonia get up, put on her kerchief and her cape, and go out of the
room and about nine o’clock she came back."
"She walked straight up to
Katerina Ivanovna and she laid thirty roubles on the table before her
in silence."
"She did not utter a word, she did not even look at her, she
simply picked up our big green _drap de dames_ shawl (we have a shawl,
made of _drap de dames_), put it over her head and face and lay down
on the bed with her face to the wall; only her little shoulders and her
body kept shuddering.... And I went on lying there, just as before....
And then I saw, young man, I saw Katerina Ivanovna, in the same silence
go up to Sonia’s little bed; she was on her knees all the evening
kissing Sonia’s feet, and would not get up, and then they both fell
asleep in each other’s arms... together, together... yes... and I... lay
drunk.”

Marmeladov stopped short, as though his voice had failed him."
"Then he
hurriedly filled his glass, drank, and cleared his throat."
"“Since then, sir,” he went on after a brief pause--“Since then, owing
to an unfortunate occurrence and through information given by
evil-intentioned persons--in all which Darya Frantsovna took a
leading part on the pretext that she had been treated with want of
respect--since then my daughter Sofya Semyonovna has been forced to take
a yellow ticket, and owing to that she is unable to go on living with
us."
"For our landlady, Amalia Fyodorovna would not hear of it (though
she had backed up Darya Frantsovna before) and Mr. Lebeziatnikov too...
hm.... All the trouble between him and Katerina Ivanovna was on Sonia’s
account."
"At first he was for making up to Sonia himself and then all of
a sudden he stood on his dignity: ‘how,’ said he, ‘can a highly educated
man like me live in the same rooms with a girl like that?’ And Katerina
Ivanovna would not let it pass, she stood up for her... and so that’s
how it happened."
"And Sonia comes to us now, mostly after dark; she
comforts Katerina Ivanovna and gives her all she can.... She has a room
at the Kapernaumovs’ the tailors, she lodges with them; Kapernaumov is
a lame man with a cleft palate and all of his numerous family have cleft
palates too."
"And his wife, too, has a cleft palate."
"They all live in one
room, but Sonia has her own, partitioned off.... Hm... yes... very poor
people and all with cleft palates... yes."
"Then I got up in the morning,
and put on my rags, lifted up my hands to heaven and set off to his
excellency Ivan Afanasyvitch."
"His excellency Ivan Afanasyvitch, do you
know him?"
No?
"Well, then, it’s a man of God you don’t know."
"He is wax...
wax before the face of the Lord; even as wax melteth!..."
"His eyes were
dim when he heard my story."
"‘Marmeladov, once already you have
deceived my expectations... I’ll take you once more on my own
responsibility’--that’s what he said, ‘remember,’ he said, ‘and now you
can go.’ I kissed the dust at his feet--in thought only, for in reality
he would not have allowed me to do it, being a statesman and a man of
modern political and enlightened ideas."
"I returned home, and when I
announced that I’d been taken back into the service and should receive a
salary, heavens, what a to-do there was!...”

Marmeladov stopped again in violent excitement."
"At that moment a whole
party of revellers already drunk came in from the street, and the sounds
of a hired concertina and the cracked piping voice of a child of seven
singing “The Hamlet” were heard in the entry."
"The room was filled with
noise."
The tavern-keeper and the boys were busy with the new-comers.
Marmeladov paying no attention to the new arrivals continued his story.
"He appeared by now to be extremely weak, but as he became more and more
drunk, he became more and more talkative."
"The recollection of his
recent success in getting the situation seemed to revive him, and was
positively reflected in a sort of radiance on his face."
"Raskolnikov
listened attentively."
"“That was five weeks ago, sir."
"Yes.... As soon as Katerina Ivanovna
and Sonia heard of it, mercy on us, it was as though I stepped into the
kingdom of Heaven."
"It used to be: you can lie like a beast, nothing but
abuse."
"Now they were walking on tiptoe, hushing the children."
"‘Semyon
Zaharovitch is tired with his work at the office, he is resting, shh!’
They made me coffee before I went to work and boiled cream for me!"
"They
began to get real cream for me, do you hear that?"
"And how they managed
to get together the money for a decent outfit--eleven roubles, fifty
copecks, I can’t guess."
"Boots, cotton shirt-fronts--most magnificent,
a uniform, they got up all in splendid style, for eleven roubles and
a half."
"The first morning I came back from the office I found Katerina
Ivanovna had cooked two courses for dinner--soup and salt meat with
horse radish--which we had never dreamed of till then."
"She had not any
dresses... none at all, but she got herself up as though she were going
on a visit; and not that she’d anything to do it with, she smartened
herself up with nothing at all, she’d done her hair nicely, put on a
clean collar of some sort, cuffs, and there she was, quite a different
person, she was younger and better looking."
"Sonia, my little darling,
had only helped with money ‘for the time,’ she said, ‘it won’t do for me
to come and see you too often."
"After dark maybe when no one can see.’ Do
you hear, do you hear?"
"I lay down for a nap after dinner and what do you
think: though Katerina Ivanovna had quarrelled to the last degree with
our landlady Amalia Fyodorovna only a week before, she could not
resist then asking her in to coffee."
"For two hours they were sitting,
whispering together."
"‘Semyon Zaharovitch is in the service again,
now, and receiving a salary,’ says she, ‘and he went himself to his
excellency and his excellency himself came out to him, made all the
others wait and led Semyon Zaharovitch by the hand before everybody into
his study.’ Do you hear, do you hear?"
"‘To be sure,’ says he, ‘Semyon
Zaharovitch, remembering your past services,’ says he, ‘and in spite
of your propensity to that foolish weakness, since you promise now and
since moreover we’ve got on badly without you,’ (do you hear, do you
hear;) ‘and so,’ says he, ‘I rely now on your word as a gentleman.’ And
all that, let me tell you, she has simply made up for herself, and not
simply out of wantonness, for the sake of bragging; no, she believes it
all herself, she amuses herself with her own fancies, upon my word she
does!"
"And I don’t blame her for it, no, I don’t blame her!..."
"Six days
ago when I brought her my first earnings in full--twenty-three roubles
forty copecks altogether--she called me her poppet: ‘poppet,’ said she,
‘my little poppet.’ And when we were by ourselves, you understand?"
"You would not think me a beauty, you would not think much of me as a
husband, would you?..."
"Well, she pinched my cheek, ‘my little poppet,’
said she.”

Marmeladov broke off, tried to smile, but suddenly his chin began
to twitch."
He controlled himself however.
"The tavern, the degraded
appearance of the man, the five nights in the hay barge, and the pot of
spirits, and yet this poignant love for his wife and children bewildered
his listener."
Raskolnikov listened intently but with a sick sensation.
He felt vexed that he had come here.
"“Honoured sir, honoured sir,” cried Marmeladov recovering himself--“Oh,
sir, perhaps all this seems a laughing matter to you, as it does to
others, and perhaps I am only worrying you with the stupidity of all the
trivial details of my home life, but it is not a laughing matter to me."
"For I can feel it all.... And the whole of that heavenly day of my life
and the whole of that evening I passed in fleeting dreams of how I would
arrange it all, and how I would dress all the children, and how I should
give her rest, and how I should rescue my own daughter from dishonour
and restore her to the bosom of her family.... And a great deal more....
Quite excusable, sir."
"Well, then, sir” (Marmeladov suddenly gave a sort
of start, raised his head and gazed intently at his listener) “well, on
the very next day after all those dreams, that is to say, exactly five
days ago, in the evening, by a cunning trick, like a thief in the night,
I stole from Katerina Ivanovna the key of her box, took out what was
left of my earnings, how much it was I have forgotten, and now look
at me, all of you!"
"It’s the fifth day since I left home, and they are
looking for me there and it’s the end of my employment, and my uniform
is lying in a tavern on the Egyptian bridge."
"I exchanged it for the
garments I have on... and it’s the end of everything!”

Marmeladov struck his forehead with his fist, clenched his teeth, closed
his eyes and leaned heavily with his elbow on the table."
"But a minute
later his face suddenly changed and with a certain assumed slyness and
affectation of bravado, he glanced at Raskolnikov, laughed and said:

“This morning I went to see Sonia, I went to ask her for a pick-me-up!"
"He-he-he!”

“You don’t say she gave it to you?” cried one of the new-comers; he
shouted the words and went off into a guffaw."
"“This very quart was bought with her money,” Marmeladov declared,
addressing himself exclusively to Raskolnikov."
"“Thirty copecks she gave
me with her own hands, her last, all she had, as I saw.... She said
nothing, she only looked at me without a word.... Not on earth, but up
yonder... they grieve over men, they weep, but they don’t blame them,
they don’t blame them!"
"But it hurts more, it hurts more when they don’t
blame!"
Thirty copecks yes!
"And maybe she needs them now, eh?"
"What do
you think, my dear sir?"
For now she’s got to keep up her appearance.
"It
costs money, that smartness, that special smartness, you know?"
"Do you
understand?"
"And there’s pomatum, too, you see, she must have things;
petticoats, starched ones, shoes, too, real jaunty ones to show off her
foot when she has to step over a puddle."
"Do you understand, sir, do you
understand what all that smartness means?"
"And here I, her own father,
here I took thirty copecks of that money for a drink!"
"And I am drinking
it!"
And I have already drunk it!
"Come, who will have pity on a man like
me, eh?"
"Are you sorry for me, sir, or not?"
"Tell me, sir, are you sorry
or not?"
"He-he-he!”

He would have filled his glass, but there was no drink left."
"The pot was
empty."
"“What are you to be pitied for?” shouted the tavern-keeper who was again
near them."
Shouts of laughter and even oaths followed.
"The laughter and the oaths
came from those who were listening and also from those who had heard
nothing but were simply looking at the figure of the discharged
government clerk."
“To be pitied!
"Why am I to be pitied?” Marmeladov suddenly declaimed,
standing up with his arm outstretched, as though he had been only
waiting for that question."
"“Why am I to be pitied, you say?"
Yes!
there’s nothing to pity me for!
"I
ought to be crucified, crucified on a cross, not pitied!"
"Crucify me,
oh judge, crucify me but pity me!"
"And then I will go of myself to be
crucified, for it’s not merry-making I seek but tears and tribulation!..."
"Do you suppose, you that sell, that this pint of yours has been
sweet to me?"
"It was tribulation I sought at the bottom of it, tears and
tribulation, and have found it, and I have tasted it; but He will pity
us Who has had pity on all men, Who has understood all men and all
things, He is the One, He too is the judge."
"He will come in that day
and He will ask: ‘Where is the daughter who gave herself for her cross,
consumptive step-mother and for the little children of another?"
"Where is
the daughter who had pity upon the filthy drunkard, her earthly father,
undismayed by his beastliness?’ And He will say, ‘Come to me!"
"I have
already forgiven thee once...."
"I have forgiven thee once.... Thy sins
which are many are forgiven thee for thou hast loved much....’ And he
will forgive my Sonia, He will forgive, I know it..."
"I felt it in my
heart when I was with her just now!"
"And He will judge and will forgive
all, the good and the evil, the wise and the meek.... And when He has
done with all of them, then He will summon us."
"‘You too come forth,’
He will say, ‘Come forth ye drunkards, come forth, ye weak ones, come
forth, ye children of shame!’ And we shall all come forth, without shame
and shall stand before him."
"And He will say unto us, ‘Ye are swine, made
in the Image of the Beast and with his mark; but come ye also!’ And the
wise ones and those of understanding will say, ‘Oh Lord, why dost Thou
receive these men?’ And He will say, ‘This is why I receive them, oh ye
wise, this is why I receive them, oh ye of understanding, that not one
of them believed himself to be worthy of this.’ And He will hold out His
hands to us and we shall fall down before him... and we shall weep...
and we shall understand all things!"
Then we shall understand all!...
"and
all will understand, Katerina Ivanovna even... she will understand....
Lord, Thy kingdom come!” And he sank down on the bench exhausted, and
helpless, looking at no one, apparently oblivious of his surroundings
and plunged in deep thought."
"His words had created a certain impression;
there was a moment of silence; but soon laughter and oaths were heard
again."
"“That’s his notion!”

“Talked himself silly!”

“A fine clerk he is!”

And so on, and so on."
"“Let us go, sir,” said Marmeladov all at once, raising his head and
addressing Raskolnikov--“come along with me... Kozel’s house, looking
into the yard."
"I’m going to Katerina Ivanovna--time I did.”

Raskolnikov had for some time been wanting to go and he had meant to
help him."
"Marmeladov was much unsteadier on his legs than in his speech
and leaned heavily on the young man."
"They had two or three hundred
paces to go."
"The drunken man was more and more overcome by dismay and
confusion as they drew nearer the house."
"“It’s not Katerina Ivanovna I am afraid of now,” he muttered in
agitation--“and that she will begin pulling my hair."
"What does my hair
matter!"
Bother my hair!
That’s what I say!
"Indeed it will be better if
she does begin pulling it, that’s not what I am afraid of... it’s her
eyes I am afraid of... yes, her eyes... the red on her cheeks, too,
frightens me... and her breathing too.... Have you noticed how people
in that disease breathe... when they are excited?"
"I am frightened of
the children’s crying, too.... For if Sonia has not taken them food..."
I don’t know what’s happened!
I don’t know!
"But blows I am not afraid
of.... Know, sir, that such blows are not a pain to me, but even an
enjoyment."
In fact I can’t get on without it.... It’s better so.
"Let
her strike me, it relieves her heart... it’s better so..."
"There is the
house."
"The house of Kozel, the cabinet-maker... a German, well-to-do."
"Lead the way!”

They went in from the yard and up to the fourth storey."
"The staircase
got darker and darker as they went up."
"It was nearly eleven o’clock
and although in summer in Petersburg there is no real night, yet it was
quite dark at the top of the stairs."
A grimy little door at the very top of the stairs stood ajar.
"A very
poor-looking room about ten paces long was lighted up by a candle-end;
the whole of it was visible from the entrance."
"It was all in disorder,
littered up with rags of all sorts, especially children’s garments."
Across the furthest corner was stretched a ragged sheet.
"Behind it
probably was the bed."
"There was nothing in the room except two chairs
and a sofa covered with American leather, full of holes, before which
stood an old deal kitchen-table, unpainted and uncovered."
"At the edge
of the table stood a smoldering tallow-candle in an iron candlestick."
"It
appeared that the family had a room to themselves, not part of a room,
but their room was practically a passage."
"The door leading to the other
rooms, or rather cupboards, into which Amalia Lippevechsel’s flat was
divided stood half open, and there was shouting, uproar and laughter
within."
People seemed to be playing cards and drinking tea there.
"Words
of the most unceremonious kind flew out from time to time."
Raskolnikov recognised Katerina Ivanovna at once.
"She was a rather tall,
slim and graceful woman, terribly emaciated, with magnificent dark brown
hair and with a hectic flush in her cheeks."
"She was pacing up and down
in her little room, pressing her hands against her chest; her lips
were parched and her breathing came in nervous broken gasps."
"Her eyes
glittered as in fever and looked about with a harsh immovable stare."
"And
that consumptive and excited face with the last flickering light of the
candle-end playing upon it made a sickening impression."
"She seemed to
Raskolnikov about thirty years old and was certainly a strange wife for
Marmeladov.... She had not heard them and did not notice them coming in."
"She seemed to be lost in thought, hearing and seeing nothing."
"The room
was close, but she had not opened the window; a stench rose from the
staircase, but the door on to the stairs was not closed."
"From the inner
rooms clouds of tobacco smoke floated in, she kept coughing, but did not
close the door."
"The youngest child, a girl of six, was asleep, sitting
curled up on the floor with her head on the sofa."
"A boy a year older
stood crying and shaking in the corner, probably he had just had a
beating."
"Beside him stood a girl of nine years old, tall and thin,
wearing a thin and ragged chemise with an ancient cashmere pelisse flung
over her bare shoulders, long outgrown and barely reaching her knees."
"Her arm, as thin as a stick, was round her brother’s neck."
"She was
trying to comfort him, whispering something to him, and doing all she
could to keep him from whimpering again."
"At the same time her large
dark eyes, which looked larger still from the thinness of her frightened
face, were watching her mother with alarm."
"Marmeladov did not enter the
door, but dropped on his knees in the very doorway, pushing Raskolnikov
in front of him."
"The woman seeing a stranger stopped indifferently
facing him, coming to herself for a moment and apparently wondering what
he had come for."
"But evidently she decided that he was going into
the next room, as he had to pass through hers to get there."
"Taking no
further notice of him, she walked towards the outer door to close it
and uttered a sudden scream on seeing her husband on his knees in the
doorway."
"“Ah!” she cried out in a frenzy, “he has come back!"
The criminal!
"the
monster!..."
And where is the money?
"What’s in your pocket, show me!"
"And
your clothes are all different!"
Where are your clothes?
"Where is the
money!"
"Speak!”

And she fell to searching him."
"Marmeladov submissively and obediently
held up both arms to facilitate the search."
Not a farthing was there.
"“Where is the money?” she cried--“Mercy on us, can he have drunk it all?"
"There were twelve silver roubles left in the chest!” and in a fury
she seized him by the hair and dragged him into the room."
"Marmeladov
seconded her efforts by meekly crawling along on his knees."
“And this is a consolation to me!
"This does not hurt me, but is a
positive con-so-la-tion, ho-nou-red sir,” he called out, shaken to and
fro by his hair and even once striking the ground with his forehead."
"The child asleep on the floor woke up, and began to cry."
"The boy in the
corner losing all control began trembling and screaming and rushed
to his sister in violent terror, almost in a fit."
"The eldest girl was
shaking like a leaf."
“He’s drunk it!
"he’s drunk it all,” the poor woman screamed in
despair--“and his clothes are gone!"
"And they are hungry, hungry!”--and
wringing her hands she pointed to the children."
"“Oh, accursed life!"
"And you, are you not ashamed?”--she pounced all at once upon
Raskolnikov--“from the tavern!"
Have you been drinking with him?
"You have
been drinking with him, too!"
"Go away!”

The young man was hastening away without uttering a word."
"The inner door
was thrown wide open and inquisitive faces were peering in at it."
"Coarse
laughing faces with pipes and cigarettes and heads wearing caps thrust
themselves in at the doorway."
"Further in could be seen figures in
dressing gowns flung open, in costumes of unseemly scantiness, some of
them with cards in their hands."
"They were particularly diverted, when
Marmeladov, dragged about by his hair, shouted that it was a consolation
to him."
"They even began to come into the room; at last a sinister shrill
outcry was heard: this came from Amalia Lippevechsel herself pushing her
way amongst them and trying to restore order after her own fashion and
for the hundredth time to frighten the poor woman by ordering her
with coarse abuse to clear out of the room next day."
"As he went out,
Raskolnikov had time to put his hand into his pocket, to snatch up the
coppers he had received in exchange for his rouble in the tavern and to
lay them unnoticed on the window."
"Afterwards on the stairs, he changed
his mind and would have gone back."
"“What a stupid thing I’ve done,” he thought to himself, “they have Sonia
and I want it myself.” But reflecting that it would be impossible to
take it back now and that in any case he would not have taken it, he
dismissed it with a wave of his hand and went back to his lodging."
"“Sonia wants pomatum too,” he said as he walked along the street, and he
laughed malignantly--“such smartness costs money.... Hm!"
"And maybe Sonia
herself will be bankrupt to-day, for there is always a risk, hunting
big game... digging for gold... then they would all be without a crust
to-morrow except for my money."
Hurrah for Sonia!
"What a mine they’ve dug
there!"
And they’re making the most of it!
"Yes, they are making the most
of it!"
They’ve wept over it and grown used to it.
"Man grows used to
everything, the scoundrel!”

He sank into thought."
"“And what if I am wrong,” he cried suddenly after a moment’s thought."
"“What if man is not really a scoundrel, man in general, I mean, the
whole race of mankind--then all the rest is prejudice, simply artificial
terrors and there are no barriers and it’s all as it should be.”



CHAPTER III

He waked up late next day after a broken sleep."
"But his sleep had not
refreshed him; he waked up bilious, irritable, ill-tempered, and looked
with hatred at his room."
"It was a tiny cupboard of a room about six
paces in length."
"It had a poverty-stricken appearance with its dusty
yellow paper peeling off the walls, and it was so low-pitched that a man
of more than average height was ill at ease in it and felt every moment
that he would knock his head against the ceiling."
"The furniture was in
keeping with the room: there were three old chairs, rather rickety; a
painted table in the corner on which lay a few manuscripts and books;
the dust that lay thick upon them showed that they had been long
untouched."
"A big clumsy sofa occupied almost the whole of one wall and
half the floor space of the room; it was once covered with chintz, but
was now in rags and served Raskolnikov as a bed."
"Often he went to sleep
on it, as he was, without undressing, without sheets, wrapped in his old
student’s overcoat, with his head on one little pillow, under which he
heaped up all the linen he had, clean and dirty, by way of a bolster."
"A
little table stood in front of the sofa."
"It would have been difficult to sink to a lower ebb of disorder, but to
Raskolnikov in his present state of mind this was positively agreeable."
"He had got completely away from everyone, like a tortoise in its shell,
and even the sight of a servant girl who had to wait upon him and looked
sometimes into his room made him writhe with nervous irritation."
"He was
in the condition that overtakes some monomaniacs entirely concentrated
upon one thing."
"His landlady had for the last fortnight given up sending
him in meals, and he had not yet thought of expostulating with her,
though he went without his dinner."
"Nastasya, the cook and only servant,
was rather pleased at the lodger’s mood and had entirely given up
sweeping and doing his room, only once a week or so she would stray into
his room with a broom."
She waked him up that day.
"“Get up, why are you asleep?” she called to him."
"“It’s past nine, I have
brought you some tea; will you have a cup?"
"I should think you’re fairly
starving?”

Raskolnikov opened his eyes, started and recognised Nastasya."
"“From the landlady, eh?” he asked, slowly and with a sickly face sitting
up on the sofa."
"“From the landlady, indeed!”

She set before him her own cracked teapot full of weak and stale tea and
laid two yellow lumps of sugar by the side of it."
"“Here, Nastasya, take it please,” he said, fumbling in his pocket (for
he had slept in his clothes) and taking out a handful of coppers--“run
and buy me a loaf."
"And get me a little sausage, the cheapest, at the
pork-butcher’s.”

“The loaf I’ll fetch you this very minute, but wouldn’t you rather have
some cabbage soup instead of sausage?"
"It’s capital soup, yesterday’s."
"I
saved it for you yesterday, but you came in late."
"It’s fine soup.”

When the soup had been brought, and he had begun upon it, Nastasya
sat down beside him on the sofa and began chatting."
"She was a country
peasant-woman and a very talkative one."
"“Praskovya Pavlovna means to complain to the police about you,” she
said."
He scowled.
“To the police?
"What does she want?”

“You don’t pay her money and you won’t turn out of the room."
"That’s what
she wants, to be sure.”

“The devil, that’s the last straw,” he muttered, grinding his teeth,
“no, that would not suit me... just now."
"She is a fool,” he added aloud."
"“I’ll go and talk to her to-day.”

“Fool she is and no mistake, just as I am."
"But why, if you are so
clever, do you lie here like a sack and have nothing to show for it?"
"One
time you used to go out, you say, to teach children."
"But why is it you
do nothing now?”

“I am doing...” Raskolnikov began sullenly and reluctantly."
"“What are you doing?”

“Work...”

“What sort of work?”

“I am thinking,” he answered seriously after a pause."
Nastasya was overcome with a fit of laughter.
"She was given to laughter
and when anything amused her, she laughed inaudibly, quivering and
shaking all over till she felt ill.

“And have you made much money by your thinking?” she managed to
articulate at last."
“One can’t go out to give lessons without boots.
"And I’m sick of it.”

“Don’t quarrel with your bread and butter.”

“They pay so little for lessons."
"What’s the use of a few coppers?” he
answered, reluctantly, as though replying to his own thought."
"“And you want to get a fortune all at once?”

He looked at her strangely."
"“Yes, I want a fortune,” he answered firmly, after a brief pause."
"“Don’t be in such a hurry, you quite frighten me!"
"Shall I get you the
loaf or not?”

“As you please.”

“Ah, I forgot!"
"A letter came for you yesterday when you were out.”

“A letter?"
for me!
"from whom?”

“I can’t say."
I gave three copecks of my own to the postman for it.
"Will
you pay me back?”

“Then bring it to me, for God’s sake, bring it,” cried Raskolnikov
greatly excited--“good God!”

A minute later the letter was brought him."
"That was it: from his mother,
from the province of R----."
He turned pale when he took it.
"It was a
long while since he had received a letter, but another feeling also
suddenly stabbed his heart."
"“Nastasya, leave me alone, for goodness’ sake; here are your three
copecks, but for goodness’ sake, make haste and go!”

The letter was quivering in his hand; he did not want to open it in her
presence; he wanted to be left _alone_ with this letter."
"When Nastasya
had gone out, he lifted it quickly to his lips and kissed it; then he
gazed intently at the address, the small, sloping handwriting, so dear
and familiar, of the mother who had once taught him to read and write."
He delayed; he seemed almost afraid of something.
"At last he opened it;
it was a thick heavy letter, weighing over two ounces, two large sheets
of note paper were covered with very small handwriting."
"“My dear Rodya,” wrote his mother--“it’s two months since I last had a
talk with you by letter which has distressed me and even kept me
awake at night, thinking."
"But I am sure you will not blame me for my
inevitable silence."
"You know how I love you; you are all we have to look
to, Dounia and I, you are our all, our one hope, our one stay."
"What a
grief it was to me when I heard that you had given up the university
some months ago, for want of means to keep yourself and that you had
lost your lessons and your other work!"
"How could I help you out of my
hundred and twenty roubles a year pension?"
"The fifteen roubles I sent
you four months ago I borrowed, as you know, on security of my pension,
from Vassily Ivanovitch Vahrushin a merchant of this town."
"He is a
kind-hearted man and was a friend of your father’s too."
"But having given
him the right to receive the pension, I had to wait till the debt was
paid off and that is only just done, so that I’ve been unable to send
you anything all this time."
"But now, thank God, I believe I shall
be able to send you something more and in fact we may congratulate
ourselves on our good fortune now, of which I hasten to inform you."
"In
the first place, would you have guessed, dear Rodya, that your sister
has been living with me for the last six weeks and we shall not be
separated in the future."
"Thank God, her sufferings are over, but I will
tell you everything in order, so that you may know just how everything
has happened and all that we have hitherto concealed from you."
"When you
wrote to me two months ago that you had heard that Dounia had a great
deal to put up with in the Svidrigaïlovs’ house, when you wrote that
and asked me to tell you all about it--what could I write in answer to
you?"
"If I had written the whole truth to you, I dare say you would have
thrown up everything and have come to us, even if you had to walk all
the way, for I know your character and your feelings, and you would not
let your sister be insulted."
"I was in despair myself, but what could I
do?"
"And, besides, I did not know the whole truth myself then."
"What
made it all so difficult was that Dounia received a hundred roubles
in advance when she took the place as governess in their family, on
condition of part of her salary being deducted every month, and so it
was impossible to throw up the situation without repaying the debt."
"This sum (now I can explain it all to you, my precious Rodya) she took
chiefly in order to send you sixty roubles, which you needed so terribly
then and which you received from us last year."
"We deceived you then,
writing that this money came from Dounia’s savings, but that was not
so, and now I tell you all about it, because, thank God, things have
suddenly changed for the better, and that you may know how Dounia loves
you and what a heart she has."
"At first indeed Mr. Svidrigaïlov treated
her very rudely and used to make disrespectful and jeering remarks at
table...."
"But I don’t want to go into all those painful details, so as
not to worry you for nothing when it is now all over."
"In short, in spite
of the kind and generous behaviour of Marfa Petrovna, Mr. Svidrigaïlov’s
wife, and all the rest of the household, Dounia had a very hard time,
especially when Mr. Svidrigaïlov, relapsing into his old regimental
habits, was under the influence of Bacchus."
"And how do you think it
was all explained later on?"
"Would you believe that the crazy fellow had
conceived a passion for Dounia from the beginning, but had concealed
it under a show of rudeness and contempt."
"Possibly he was ashamed and
horrified himself at his own flighty hopes, considering his years and
his being the father of a family; and that made him angry with Dounia."
"And possibly, too, he hoped by his rude and sneering behaviour to hide
the truth from others."
"But at last he lost all control and had the face
to make Dounia an open and shameful proposal, promising her all sorts of
inducements and offering, besides, to throw up everything and take her
to another estate of his, or even abroad."
"You can imagine all she went
through!"
"To leave her situation at once was impossible not only on
account of the money debt, but also to spare the feelings of Marfa
Petrovna, whose suspicions would have been aroused: and then Dounia
would have been the cause of a rupture in the family."
"And it would
have meant a terrible scandal for Dounia too; that would have been
inevitable."
"There were various other reasons owing to which Dounia could
not hope to escape from that awful house for another six weeks."
"You know
Dounia, of course; you know how clever she is and what a strong will she
has."
"Dounia can endure a great deal and even in the most difficult cases
she has the fortitude to maintain her firmness."
"She did not even write
to me about everything for fear of upsetting me, although we were
constantly in communication."
It all ended very unexpectedly.
"Marfa
Petrovna accidentally overheard her husband imploring Dounia in the
garden, and, putting quite a wrong interpretation on the position, threw
the blame upon her, believing her to be the cause of it all."
"An awful
scene took place between them on the spot in the garden; Marfa Petrovna
went so far as to strike Dounia, refused to hear anything and was
shouting at her for a whole hour and then gave orders that Dounia should
be packed off at once to me in a plain peasant’s cart, into which they
flung all her things, her linen and her clothes, all pell-mell, without
folding it up and packing it."
"And a heavy shower of rain came on, too,
and Dounia, insulted and put to shame, had to drive with a peasant in an
open cart all the seventeen versts into town."
"Only think now what answer
could I have sent to the letter I received from you two months ago and
what could I have written?"
"I was in despair; I dared not write to
you the truth because you would have been very unhappy, mortified
and indignant, and yet what could you do?"
"You could only perhaps ruin
yourself, and, besides, Dounia would not allow it; and fill up my letter
with trifles when my heart was so full of sorrow, I could not."
"For a
whole month the town was full of gossip about this scandal, and it came
to such a pass that Dounia and I dared not even go to church on account
of the contemptuous looks, whispers, and even remarks made aloud about
us."
"All our acquaintances avoided us, nobody even bowed to us in the
street, and I learnt that some shopmen and clerks were intending to
insult us in a shameful way, smearing the gates of our house with pitch,
so that the landlord began to tell us we must leave."
"All this was set
going by Marfa Petrovna who managed to slander Dounia and throw dirt at
her in every family."
"She knows everyone in the neighbourhood, and that
month she was continually coming into the town, and as she is
rather talkative and fond of gossiping about her family affairs and
particularly of complaining to all and each of her husband--which is not
at all right--so in a short time she had spread her story not only in
the town, but over the whole surrounding district."
"It made me ill, but
Dounia bore it better than I did, and if only you could have seen how
she endured it all and tried to comfort me and cheer me up!"
"She is
an angel!"
"But by God’s mercy, our sufferings were cut short: Mr.
Svidrigaïlov returned to his senses and repented and, probably
feeling sorry for Dounia, he laid before Marfa Petrovna a complete and
unmistakable proof of Dounia’s innocence, in the form of a letter Dounia
had been forced to write and give to him, before Marfa Petrovna
came upon them in the garden."
"This letter, which remained in Mr.
Svidrigaïlov’s hands after her departure, she had written to refuse
personal explanations and secret interviews, for which he was entreating
her."
"In that letter she reproached him with great heat and indignation
for the baseness of his behaviour in regard to Marfa Petrovna, reminding
him that he was the father and head of a family and telling him how
infamous it was of him to torment and make unhappy a defenceless girl,
unhappy enough already."
"Indeed, dear Rodya, the letter was so nobly and
touchingly written that I sobbed when I read it and to this day I cannot
read it without tears."
"Moreover, the evidence of the servants, too,
cleared Dounia’s reputation; they had seen and known a great deal more
than Mr. Svidrigaïlov had himself supposed--as indeed is always the case
with servants."
"Marfa Petrovna was completely taken aback, and ‘again
crushed’ as she said herself to us, but she was completely convinced of
Dounia’s innocence."
"The very next day, being Sunday, she went straight
to the Cathedral, knelt down and prayed with tears to Our Lady to give
her strength to bear this new trial and to do her duty."
"Then she
came straight from the Cathedral to us, told us the whole story, wept
bitterly and, fully penitent, she embraced Dounia and besought her to
forgive her."
"The same morning without any delay, she went round to all
the houses in the town and everywhere, shedding tears, she asserted in
the most flattering terms Dounia’s innocence and the nobility of
her feelings and her behavior."
"What was more, she showed and read to
everyone the letter in Dounia’s own handwriting to Mr. Svidrigaïlov and
even allowed them to take copies of it--which I must say I think was
superfluous."
"In this way she was busy for several days in driving about
the whole town, because some people had taken offence through precedence
having been given to others."
"And therefore they had to take turns, so
that in every house she was expected before she arrived, and everyone
knew that on such and such a day Marfa Petrovna would be reading the
letter in such and such a place and people assembled for every reading
of it, even many who had heard it several times already both in their
own houses and in other people’s."
"In my opinion a great deal, a very
great deal of all this was unnecessary; but that’s Marfa Petrovna’s
character."
"Anyway she succeeded in completely re-establishing Dounia’s
reputation and the whole ignominy of this affair rested as an indelible
disgrace upon her husband, as the only person to blame, so that I really
began to feel sorry for him; it was really treating the crazy fellow too
harshly."
"Dounia was at once asked to give lessons in several families,
but she refused."
"All of a sudden everyone began to treat her with marked
respect and all this did much to bring about the event by which, one may
say, our whole fortunes are now transformed."
"You must know, dear Rodya,
that Dounia has a suitor and that she has already consented to marry
him."
"I hasten to tell you all about the matter, and though it has been
arranged without asking your consent, I think you will not be aggrieved
with me or with your sister on that account, for you will see that we
could not wait and put off our decision till we heard from you."
"And you
could not have judged all the facts without being on the spot."
"This
was how it happened."
"He is already of the rank of a counsellor, Pyotr
Petrovitch Luzhin, and is distantly related to Marfa Petrovna, who
has been very active in bringing the match about."
"It began with his
expressing through her his desire to make our acquaintance."
"He was
properly received, drank coffee with us and the very next day he sent
us a letter in which he very courteously made an offer and begged for a
speedy and decided answer."
"He is a very busy man and is in a great hurry
to get to Petersburg, so that every moment is precious to him."
"At first,
of course, we were greatly surprised, as it had all happened so quickly
and unexpectedly."
We thought and talked it over the whole day.
"He is a
well-to-do man, to be depended upon, he has two posts in the government
and has already made his fortune."
"It is true that he is forty-five years
old, but he is of a fairly prepossessing appearance and might still be
thought attractive by women, and he is altogether a very respectable and
presentable man, only he seems a little morose and somewhat conceited."
But possibly that may only be the impression he makes at first sight.
"And beware, dear Rodya, when he comes to Petersburg, as he shortly will
do, beware of judging him too hastily and severely, as your way is, if
there is anything you do not like in him at first sight."
"I give you this
warning, although I feel sure that he will make a favourable impression
upon you."
"Moreover, in order to understand any man one must be
deliberate and careful to avoid forming prejudices and mistaken ideas,
which are very difficult to correct and get over afterwards."
"And Pyotr
Petrovitch, judging by many indications, is a thoroughly estimable man."
"At his first visit, indeed, he told us that he was a practical man, but
still he shares, as he expressed it, many of the convictions ‘of our
most rising generation’ and he is an opponent of all prejudices."
"He
said a good deal more, for he seems a little conceited and likes to be
listened to, but this is scarcely a vice."
"I, of course, understood very
little of it, but Dounia explained to me that, though he is not a man
of great education, he is clever and seems to be good-natured."
"You know
your sister’s character, Rodya."
"She is a resolute, sensible, patient and
generous girl, but she has a passionate heart, as I know very well."
"Of course, there is no great love either on his side, or on hers, but
Dounia is a clever girl and has the heart of an angel, and will make
it her duty to make her husband happy who on his side will make her
happiness his care."
"Of that we have no good reason to doubt, though it
must be admitted the matter has been arranged in great haste."
"Besides he
is a man of great prudence and he will see, to be sure, of himself, that
his own happiness will be the more secure, the happier Dounia is with
him."
"And as for some defects of character, for some habits and even
certain differences of opinion--which indeed are inevitable even in
the happiest marriages--Dounia has said that, as regards all that, she
relies on herself, that there is nothing to be uneasy about, and
that she is ready to put up with a great deal, if only their future
relationship can be an honourable and straightforward one."
"He struck me,
for instance, at first, as rather abrupt, but that may well come
from his being an outspoken man, and that is no doubt how it is."
"For
instance, at his second visit, after he had received Dounia’s consent,
in the course of conversation, he declared that before making
Dounia’s acquaintance, he had made up his mind to marry a girl of
good reputation, without dowry and, above all, one who had experienced
poverty, because, as he explained, a man ought not to be indebted to his
wife, but that it is better for a wife to look upon her husband as her
benefactor."
"I must add that he expressed it more nicely and politely
than I have done, for I have forgotten his actual phrases and only
remember the meaning."
"And, besides, it was obviously not said of design,
but slipped out in the heat of conversation, so that he tried afterwards
to correct himself and smooth it over, but all the same it did strike
me as somewhat rude, and I said so afterwards to Dounia."
"But Dounia was
vexed, and answered that ‘words are not deeds,’ and that, of course, is
perfectly true."
"Dounia did not sleep all night before she made up
her mind, and, thinking that I was asleep, she got out of bed and was
walking up and down the room all night; at last she knelt down before
the ikon and prayed long and fervently and in the morning she told me
that she had decided."
"“I have mentioned already that Pyotr Petrovitch is just setting off for
Petersburg, where he has a great deal of business, and he wants to open
a legal bureau."
"He has been occupied for many years in conducting civil
and commercial litigation, and only the other day he won an important
case."
"He has to be in Petersburg because he has an important case before
the Senate."
"So, Rodya dear, he may be of the greatest use to you, in
every way indeed, and Dounia and I have agreed that from this very day
you could definitely enter upon your career and might consider that
your future is marked out and assured for you."
"Oh, if only this comes to
pass!"
"This would be such a benefit that we could only look upon it as a
providential blessing."
Dounia is dreaming of nothing else.
"We have even
ventured already to drop a few words on the subject to Pyotr Petrovitch."
"He was cautious in his answer, and said that, of course, as he could not
get on without a secretary, it would be better to be paying a salary to
a relation than to a stranger, if only the former were fitted for the
duties (as though there could be doubt of your being fitted!)"
"but then
he expressed doubts whether your studies at the university would leave
you time for work at his office."
"The matter dropped for the time, but
Dounia is thinking of nothing else now."
"She has been in a sort of fever
for the last few days, and has already made a regular plan for
your becoming in the end an associate and even a partner in Pyotr
Petrovitch’s business, which might well be, seeing that you are a
student of law."
"I am in complete agreement with her, Rodya, and share
all her plans and hopes, and think there is every probability of
realising them."
"And in spite of Pyotr Petrovitch’s evasiveness, very
natural at present (since he does not know you), Dounia is firmly
persuaded that she will gain everything by her good influence over her
future husband; this she is reckoning upon."
"Of course we are careful
not to talk of any of these more remote plans to Pyotr Petrovitch,
especially of your becoming his partner."
"He is a practical man and might
take this very coldly, it might all seem to him simply a day-dream."
"Nor
has either Dounia or I breathed a word to him of the great hopes we have
of his helping us to pay for your university studies; we have not spoken
of it in the first place, because it will come to pass of itself,
later on, and he will no doubt without wasting words offer to do it of
himself, (as though he could refuse Dounia that) the more readily since
you may by your own efforts become his right hand in the office, and
receive this assistance not as a charity, but as a salary earned by your
own work."
"Dounia wants to arrange it all like this and I quite agree
with her."
"And we have not spoken of our plans for another reason, that
is, because I particularly wanted you to feel on an equal footing when
you first meet him."
"When Dounia spoke to him with enthusiasm about
you, he answered that one could never judge of a man without seeing
him close, for oneself, and that he looked forward to forming his own
opinion when he makes your acquaintance."
"Do you know, my precious
Rodya, I think that perhaps for some reasons (nothing to do with Pyotr
Petrovitch though, simply for my own personal, perhaps old-womanish,
fancies) I should do better to go on living by myself, apart, than with
them, after the wedding."
"I am convinced that he will be generous and
delicate enough to invite me and to urge me to remain with my daughter
for the future, and if he has said nothing about it hitherto, it is
simply because it has been taken for granted; but I shall refuse."
"I have
noticed more than once in my life that husbands don’t quite get on with
their mothers-in-law, and I don’t want to be the least bit in anyone’s
way, and for my own sake, too, would rather be quite independent, so
long as I have a crust of bread of my own, and such children as you and
Dounia."
"If possible, I would settle somewhere near you, for the most
joyful piece of news, dear Rodya, I have kept for the end of my letter:
know then, my dear boy, that we may, perhaps, be all together in a
very short time and may embrace one another again after a separation of
almost three years!"
"It is settled _for certain_ that Dounia and I are to
set off for Petersburg, exactly when I don’t know, but very, very soon,
possibly in a week."
"It all depends on Pyotr Petrovitch who will let us
know when he has had time to look round him in Petersburg."
"To suit his
own arrangements he is anxious to have the ceremony as soon as possible,
even before the fast of Our Lady, if it could be managed, or if that is
too soon to be ready, immediately after."
"Oh, with what happiness I shall
press you to my heart!"
"Dounia is all excitement at the joyful thought
of seeing you, she said one day in joke that she would be ready to marry
Pyotr Petrovitch for that alone."
She is an angel!
"She is not writing
anything to you now, and has only told me to write that she has so much,
so much to tell you that she is not going to take up her pen now, for
a few lines would tell you nothing, and it would only mean upsetting
herself; she bids me send you her love and innumerable kisses."
"But
although we shall be meeting so soon, perhaps I shall send you as much
money as I can in a day or two."
"Now that everyone has heard that Dounia
is to marry Pyotr Petrovitch, my credit has suddenly improved and I know
that Afanasy Ivanovitch will trust me now even to seventy-five roubles
on the security of my pension, so that perhaps I shall be able to send
you twenty-five or even thirty roubles."
"I would send you more, but I am
uneasy about our travelling expenses; for though Pyotr Petrovitch has
been so kind as to undertake part of the expenses of the journey, that
is to say, he has taken upon himself the conveyance of our bags and big
trunk (which will be conveyed through some acquaintances of his), we
must reckon upon some expense on our arrival in Petersburg, where we
can’t be left without a halfpenny, at least for the first few days."
"But
we have calculated it all, Dounia and I, to the last penny, and we see
that the journey will not cost very much."
"It is only ninety versts from
us to the railway and we have come to an agreement with a driver we
know, so as to be in readiness; and from there Dounia and I can travel
quite comfortably third class."
"So that I may very likely be able to send
to you not twenty-five, but thirty roubles."
"But enough; I have covered
two sheets already and there is no space left for more; our whole
history, but so many events have happened!"
"And now, my precious Rodya,
I embrace you and send you a mother’s blessing till we meet."
"Love Dounia
your sister, Rodya; love her as she loves you and understand that she
loves you beyond everything, more than herself."
"She is an angel and you,
Rodya, you are everything to us--our one hope, our one consolation."
"If
only you are happy, we shall be happy."
"Do you still say your prayers,
Rodya, and believe in the mercy of our Creator and our Redeemer?"
"I am
afraid in my heart that you may have been visited by the new spirit of
infidelity that is abroad to-day; If it is so, I pray for you."
"Remember,
dear boy, how in your childhood, when your father was living, you used
to lisp your prayers at my knee, and how happy we all were in those
days."
"Good-bye, till we meet then--I embrace you warmly, warmly, with
many kisses."
"“Yours till death,

“PULCHERIA RASKOLNIKOV.”


Almost from the first, while he read the letter, Raskolnikov’s face was
wet with tears; but when he finished it, his face was pale and distorted
and a bitter, wrathful and malignant smile was on his lips."
"He laid his
head down on his threadbare dirty pillow and pondered, pondered a long
time."
"His heart was beating violently, and his brain was in a turmoil."
"At last he felt cramped and stifled in the little yellow room that was
like a cupboard or a box."
His eyes and his mind craved for space.
"He
took up his hat and went out, this time without dread of meeting
anyone; he had forgotten his dread."
"He turned in the direction of the
Vassilyevsky Ostrov, walking along Vassilyevsky Prospect, as though
hastening on some business, but he walked, as his habit was, without
noticing his way, muttering and even speaking aloud to himself, to the
astonishment of the passers-by."
Many of them took him to be drunk.
"CHAPTER IV

His mother’s letter had been a torture to him, but as regards the chief
fact in it, he had felt not one moment’s hesitation, even whilst he was
reading the letter."
"The essential question was settled, and irrevocably
settled, in his mind: “Never such a marriage while I am alive and
Mr. Luzhin be damned!” “The thing is perfectly clear,” he muttered
to himself, with a malignant smile anticipating the triumph of his
decision."
"“No, mother, no, Dounia, you won’t deceive me!"
"and then they
apologise for not asking my advice and for taking the decision without
me!"
I dare say!
"They imagine it is arranged now and can’t be broken
off; but we will see whether it can or not!"
"A magnificent excuse:
‘Pyotr Petrovitch is such a busy man that even his wedding has to be in
post-haste, almost by express.’ No, Dounia, I see it all and I know what
you want to say to me; and I know too what you were thinking about, when
you walked up and down all night, and what your prayers were like before
the Holy Mother of Kazan who stands in mother’s bedroom."
"Bitter is
the ascent to Golgotha.... Hm... so it is finally settled; you have
determined to marry a sensible business man, Avdotya Romanovna, one
who has a fortune (has _already_ made his fortune, that is so much
more solid and impressive), a man who holds two government posts and who
shares the ideas of our most rising generation, as mother writes, and
who _seems_ to be kind, as Dounia herself observes."
"That _seems_ beats
everything!"
"And that very Dounia for that very ‘_seems_’ is marrying
him!"
Splendid!
splendid!
“...
"But I should like to know why mother has written to me about ‘our
most rising generation’?"
"Simply as a descriptive touch, or with the idea
of prepossessing me in favour of Mr. Luzhin?"
"Oh, the cunning of them!"
"I should like to know one thing more: how far they were open with one
another that day and night and all this time since?"
"Was it all put into
_words_, or did both understand that they had the same thing at heart
and in their minds, so that there was no need to speak of it aloud, and
better not to speak of it."
"Most likely it was partly like that, from
mother’s letter it’s evident: he struck her as rude _a little_, and
mother in her simplicity took her observations to Dounia."
"And she was
sure to be vexed and ‘answered her angrily.’ I should think so!"
"Who
would not be angered when it was quite clear without any naïve questions
and when it was understood that it was useless to discuss it."
"And why
does she write to me, ‘love Dounia, Rodya, and she loves you more than
herself’?"
"Has she a secret conscience-prick at sacrificing her daughter
to her son?"
"‘You are our one comfort, you are everything to us.’ Oh,
mother!”

His bitterness grew more and more intense, and if he had happened to
meet Mr. Luzhin at the moment, he might have murdered him."
"“Hm... yes, that’s true,” he continued, pursuing the whirling ideas that
chased each other in his brain, “it is true that ‘it needs time and care
to get to know a man,’ but there is no mistake about Mr. Luzhin."
"The
chief thing is he is ‘a man of business and _seems_ kind,’ that was
something, wasn’t it, to send the bags and big box for them!"
"A kind man,
no doubt after that!"
"But his _bride_ and her mother are to drive in a
peasant’s cart covered with sacking (I know, I have been driven in
it)."
No matter!
"It is only ninety versts and then they can ‘travel very
comfortably, third class,’ for a thousand versts!"
"Quite right, too."
"One
must cut one’s coat according to one’s cloth, but what about you, Mr.
Luzhin?"
"She is your bride.... And you must be aware that her mother has
to raise money on her pension for the journey."
"To be sure it’s a matter
of business, a partnership for mutual benefit, with equal shares and
expenses;--food and drink provided, but pay for your tobacco."
"The
business man has got the better of them, too."
"The luggage will cost less
than their fares and very likely go for nothing."
"How is it that they
don’t both see all that, or is it that they don’t want to see?"
"And
they are pleased, pleased!"
"And to think that this is only the first
blossoming, and that the real fruits are to come!"
"But what really
matters is not the stinginess, is not the meanness, but the _tone_
of the whole thing."
"For that will be the tone after marriage, it’s a
foretaste of it."
"And mother too, why should she be so lavish?"
"What will
she have by the time she gets to Petersburg?"
"Three silver roubles or
two ‘paper ones’ as _she_ says.... that old woman... hm."
"What does
she expect to live upon in Petersburg afterwards?"
"She has her reasons
already for guessing that she _could not_ live with Dounia after the
marriage, even for the first few months."
"The good man has no doubt let
slip something on that subject also, though mother would deny it: ‘I
shall refuse,’ says she."
On whom is she reckoning then?
"Is she counting
on what is left of her hundred and twenty roubles of pension when
Afanasy Ivanovitch’s debt is paid?"
"She knits woollen shawls and
embroiders cuffs, ruining her old eyes."
"And all her shawls don’t add
more than twenty roubles a year to her hundred and twenty, I know
that."
"So she is building all her hopes all the time on Mr. Luzhin’s
generosity; ‘he will offer it of himself, he will press it on me.’
You may wait a long time for that!"
"That’s how it always is with these
Schilleresque noble hearts; till the last moment every goose is a swan
with them, till the last moment, they hope for the best and will see
nothing wrong, and although they have an inkling of the other side of
the picture, yet they won’t face the truth till they are forced to; the
very thought of it makes them shiver; they thrust the truth away with
both hands, until the man they deck out in false colours puts a fool’s
cap on them with his own hands."
"I should like to know whether Mr. Luzhin
has any orders of merit; I bet he has the Anna in his buttonhole and
that he puts it on when he goes to dine with contractors or merchants."
"He will be sure to have it for his wedding, too!"
"Enough of him, confound
him!"
"“Well,... mother I don’t wonder at, it’s like her, God bless her, but
how could Dounia?"
"Dounia darling, as though I did not know you!"
"You were
nearly twenty when I saw you last: I understood you then."
"Mother writes
that ‘Dounia can put up with a great deal.’ I know that very well."
"I
knew that two years and a half ago, and for the last two and a half
years I have been thinking about it, thinking of just that, that ‘Dounia
can put up with a great deal.’ If she could put up with Mr. Svidrigaïlov
and all the rest of it, she certainly can put up with a great deal."
"And
now mother and she have taken it into their heads that she can put up
with Mr. Luzhin, who propounds the theory of the superiority of
wives raised from destitution and owing everything to their husband’s
bounty--who propounds it, too, almost at the first interview."
"Granted
that he ‘let it slip,’ though he is a sensible man, (yet maybe it
was not a slip at all, but he meant to make himself clear as soon as
possible) but Dounia, Dounia?"
"She understands the man, of course, but
she will have to live with the man."
Why!
"she’d live on black bread
and water, she would not sell her soul, she would not barter her moral
freedom for comfort; she would not barter it for all Schleswig-Holstein,
much less Mr. Luzhin’s money."
"No, Dounia was not that sort when I knew
her and... she is still the same, of course!"
"Yes, there’s no denying,
the Svidrigaïlovs are a bitter pill!"
"It’s a bitter thing to spend one’s
life a governess in the provinces for two hundred roubles, but I know
she would rather be a nigger on a plantation or a Lett with a German
master than degrade her soul, and her moral dignity, by binding herself
for ever to a man whom she does not respect and with whom she has
nothing in common--for her own advantage."
"And if Mr. Luzhin had been of
unalloyed gold, or one huge diamond, she would never have consented to
become his legal concubine."
Why is she consenting then?
"What’s the
point of it?"
What’s the answer?
"It’s clear enough: for herself, for her
comfort, to save her life she would not sell herself, but for someone
else she is doing it!"
"For one she loves, for one she adores, she will
sell herself!"
"That’s what it all amounts to; for her brother, for her
mother, she will sell herself!"
She will sell everything!
"In such cases,
‘we overcome our moral feeling if necessary,’ freedom, peace, conscience
even, all, all are brought into the market."
"Let my life go, if only my
dear ones may be happy!"
"More than that, we become casuists, we learn
to be Jesuitical and for a time maybe we can soothe ourselves, we can
persuade ourselves that it is one’s duty for a good object."
"That’s just
like us, it’s as clear as daylight."
"It’s clear that Rodion Romanovitch
Raskolnikov is the central figure in the business, and no one else."
"Oh,
yes, she can ensure his happiness, keep him in the university, make him
a partner in the office, make his whole future secure; perhaps he may
even be a rich man later on, prosperous, respected, and may even end his
life a famous man!"
But my mother?
"It’s all Rodya, precious Rodya, her
first born!"
For such a son who would not sacrifice such a daughter!
"Oh,
loving, over-partial hearts!"
"Why, for his sake we would not shrink even
from Sonia’s fate."
"Sonia, Sonia Marmeladov, the eternal victim so long
as the world lasts."
"Have you taken the measure of your sacrifice, both
of you?"
Is it right?
Can you bear it?
Is it any use?
"Is there sense in
it?"
"And let me tell you, Dounia, Sonia’s life is no worse than life with
Mr. Luzhin."
"‘There can be no question of love,’ mother writes."
"And what
if there can be no respect either, if on the contrary there is aversion,
contempt, repulsion, what then?"
"So you will have to ‘keep up your
appearance,’ too."
Is not that so?
"Do you understand what that smartness
means?"
"Do you understand that the Luzhin smartness is just the same
thing as Sonia’s and may be worse, viler, baser, because in your case,
Dounia, it’s a bargain for luxuries, after all, but with Sonia it’s
simply a question of starvation."
"It has to be paid for, it has to be
paid for, Dounia, this smartness."
"And what if it’s more than you can
bear afterwards, if you regret it?"
"The bitterness, the misery, the
curses, the tears hidden from all the world, for you are not a Marfa
Petrovna."
And how will your mother feel then?
"Even now she is uneasy,
she is worried, but then, when she sees it all clearly?"
And I?
"Yes,
indeed, what have you taken me for?"
"I won’t have your sacrifice, Dounia,
I won’t have it, mother!"
"It shall not be, so long as I am alive, it
shall not, it shall not!"
"I won’t accept it!”

He suddenly paused in his reflection and stood still."
“It shall not be?
But what are you going to do to prevent it?
"You’ll
forbid it?"
And what right have you?
"What can you promise them on your
side to give you such a right?"
"Your whole life, your whole future, you
will devote to them _when you have finished your studies and obtained a
post_?"
"Yes, we have heard all that before, and that’s all _words_, but
now?"
"Now something must be done, now, do you understand that?"
"And
what are you doing now?"
You are living upon them.
"They borrow on their
hundred roubles pension."
They borrow from the Svidrigaïlovs.
"How are
you going to save them from Svidrigaïlovs, from Afanasy Ivanovitch
Vahrushin, oh, future millionaire Zeus who would arrange their lives for
them?"
In another ten years?
"In another ten years, mother will be blind
with knitting shawls, maybe with weeping too."
"She will be worn to a
shadow with fasting; and my sister?"
"Imagine for a moment what may have
become of your sister in ten years?"
"What may happen to her during those
ten years?"
"Can you fancy?”

So he tortured himself, fretting himself with such questions, and
finding a kind of enjoyment in it."
"And yet all these questions were not
new ones suddenly confronting him, they were old familiar aches."
"It was
long since they had first begun to grip and rend his heart."
"Long, long
ago his present anguish had its first beginnings; it had waxed and
gathered strength, it had matured and concentrated, until it had taken
the form of a fearful, frenzied and fantastic question, which tortured
his heart and mind, clamouring insistently for an answer."
"Now his
mother’s letter had burst on him like a thunderclap."
"It was clear
that he must not now suffer passively, worrying himself over unsolved
questions, but that he must do something, do it at once, and do it
quickly."
"Anyway he must decide on something, or else...

“Or throw up life altogether!” he cried suddenly, in a frenzy--“accept
one’s lot humbly as it is, once for all and stifle everything in
oneself, giving up all claim to activity, life and love!”

“Do you understand, sir, do you understand what it means when you have
absolutely nowhere to turn?” Marmeladov’s question came suddenly into
his mind, “for every man must have somewhere to turn....”

He gave a sudden start; another thought, that he had had yesterday,
slipped back into his mind."
"But he did not start at the thought
recurring to him, for he knew, he had _felt beforehand_, that it must
come back, he was expecting it; besides it was not only yesterday’s
thought."
"The difference was that a month ago, yesterday even, the
thought was a mere dream: but now... now it appeared not a dream at all,
it had taken a new menacing and quite unfamiliar shape, and he suddenly
became aware of this himself...."
"He felt a hammering in his head, and
there was a darkness before his eyes."
"He looked round hurriedly, he was searching for something."
"He wanted
to sit down and was looking for a seat; he was walking along the K----
Boulevard."
There was a seat about a hundred paces in front of him.
"He
walked towards it as fast he could; but on the way he met with a little
adventure which absorbed all his attention."
"Looking for the seat, he had
noticed a woman walking some twenty paces in front of him, but at first
he took no more notice of her than of other objects that crossed his
path."
"It had happened to him many times going home not to notice the
road by which he was going, and he was accustomed to walk like that."
"But
there was at first sight something so strange about the woman in front
of him, that gradually his attention was riveted upon her, at first
reluctantly and, as it were, resentfully, and then more and more
intently."
"He felt a sudden desire to find out what it was that was so
strange about the woman."
"In the first place, she appeared to be a girl
quite young, and she was walking in the great heat bareheaded and with
no parasol or gloves, waving her arms about in an absurd way."
"She had
on a dress of some light silky material, but put on strangely awry, not
properly hooked up, and torn open at the top of the skirt, close to the
waist: a great piece was rent and hanging loose."
"A little kerchief was
flung about her bare throat, but lay slanting on one side."
"The girl was
walking unsteadily, too, stumbling and staggering from side to side."
"She
drew Raskolnikov’s whole attention at last."
"He overtook the girl at the
seat, but, on reaching it, she dropped down on it, in the corner;
she let her head sink on the back of the seat and closed her eyes,
apparently in extreme exhaustion."
"Looking at her closely, he saw at once
that she was completely drunk."
It was a strange and shocking sight.
"He
could hardly believe that he was not mistaken."
"He saw before him the
face of a quite young, fair-haired girl--sixteen, perhaps not more than
fifteen, years old, pretty little face, but flushed and heavy looking
and, as it were, swollen."
"The girl seemed hardly to know what she was
doing; she crossed one leg over the other, lifting it indecorously, and
showed every sign of being unconscious that she was in the street."
"Raskolnikov did not sit down, but he felt unwilling to leave her,
and stood facing her in perplexity."
"This boulevard was never much
frequented; and now, at two o’clock, in the stifling heat, it was quite
deserted."
"And yet on the further side of the boulevard, about fifteen
paces away, a gentleman was standing on the edge of the pavement."
"He,
too, would apparently have liked to approach the girl with some object
of his own."
"He, too, had probably seen her in the distance and had
followed her, but found Raskolnikov in his way."
"He looked angrily at
him, though he tried to escape his notice, and stood impatiently biding
his time, till the unwelcome man in rags should have moved away."
"His
intentions were unmistakable."
"The gentleman was a plump, thickly-set
man, about thirty, fashionably dressed, with a high colour, red lips and
moustaches."
"Raskolnikov felt furious; he had a sudden longing to insult
this fat dandy in some way."
"He left the girl for a moment and walked
towards the gentleman."
“Hey!
You Svidrigaïlov!
"What do you want here?” he shouted, clenching
his fists and laughing, spluttering with rage."
"“What do you mean?” the gentleman asked sternly, scowling in haughty
astonishment."
"“Get away, that’s what I mean.”

“How dare you, you low fellow!”

He raised his cane."
"Raskolnikov rushed at him with his fists, without
reflecting that the stout gentleman was a match for two men like
himself."
"But at that instant someone seized him from behind, and a
police constable stood between them."
"“That’s enough, gentlemen, no fighting, please, in a public place."
"What
do you want?"
"Who are you?” he asked Raskolnikov sternly, noticing his
rags."
Raskolnikov looked at him intently.
"He had a straight-forward, sensible,
soldierly face, with grey moustaches and whiskers."
"“You are just the man I want,” Raskolnikov cried, catching at his arm."
"“I am a student, Raskolnikov.... You may as well know that too,” he
added, addressing the gentleman, “come along, I have something to show
you.”

And taking the policeman by the hand he drew him towards the seat."
"“Look here, hopelessly drunk, and she has just come down the boulevard."
"There is no telling who and what she is, she does not look like a
professional."
"It’s more likely she has been given drink and deceived
somewhere... for the first time... you understand?"
"and they’ve put her
out into the street like that."
"Look at the way her dress is torn, and
the way it has been put on: she has been dressed by somebody, she has
not dressed herself, and dressed by unpractised hands, by a man’s hands;
that’s evident."
"And now look there: I don’t know that dandy with whom I
was going to fight, I see him for the first time, but he, too, has seen
her on the road, just now, drunk, not knowing what she is doing, and now
he is very eager to get hold of her, to get her away somewhere while she
is in this state... that’s certain, believe me, I am not wrong."
"I saw
him myself watching her and following her, but I prevented him, and he
is just waiting for me to go away."
"Now he has walked away a little, and
is standing still, pretending to make a cigarette...."
"Think how can we
keep her out of his hands, and how are we to get her home?”

The policeman saw it all in a flash."
"The stout gentleman was easy to
understand, he turned to consider the girl."
"The policeman bent over to
examine her more closely, and his face worked with genuine compassion."
"“Ah, what a pity!” he said, shaking his head--“why, she is quite a
child!"
"She has been deceived, you can see that at once."
"Listen, lady,”
 he began addressing her, “where do you live?” The girl opened her weary
and sleepy-looking eyes, gazed blankly at the speaker and waved her
hand."
"“Here,” said Raskolnikov feeling in his pocket and finding twenty
copecks, “here, call a cab and tell him to drive her to her address."
"The
only thing is to find out her address!”

“Missy, missy!” the policeman began again, taking the money."
"“I’ll fetch
you a cab and take you home myself."
"Where shall I take you, eh?"
"Where do
you live?”

“Go away!"
"They won’t let me alone,” the girl muttered, and once more
waved her hand."
"“Ach, ach, how shocking!"
"It’s shameful, missy, it’s a shame!” He shook
his head again, shocked, sympathetic and indignant."
"“It’s a difficult job,” the policeman said to Raskolnikov, and as he
did so, he looked him up and down in a rapid glance."
"He, too, must have
seemed a strange figure to him: dressed in rags and handing him money!"
“Did you meet her far from here?” he asked him.
"“I tell you she was walking in front of me, staggering, just here, in
the boulevard."
"She only just reached the seat and sank down on it.”

“Ah, the shameful things that are done in the world nowadays, God have
mercy on us!"
"An innocent creature like that, drunk already!"
"She has been
deceived, that’s a sure thing."
"See how her dress has been torn too....
Ah, the vice one sees nowadays!"
"And as likely as not she belongs to
gentlefolk too, poor ones maybe...."
There are many like that nowadays.
"She looks refined, too, as though she were a lady,” and he bent over her
once more."
"Perhaps he had daughters growing up like that, “looking like ladies and
refined” with pretensions to gentility and smartness....

“The chief thing is,” Raskolnikov persisted, “to keep her out of this
scoundrel’s hands!"
Why should he outrage her!
"It’s as clear as day what
he is after; ah, the brute, he is not moving off!”

Raskolnikov spoke aloud and pointed to him."
"The gentleman heard him,
and seemed about to fly into a rage again, but thought better of it, and
confined himself to a contemptuous look."
"He then walked slowly another
ten paces away and again halted."
"“Keep her out of his hands we can,” said the constable thoughtfully,
“if only she’d tell us where to take her, but as it is.... Missy, hey,
missy!” he bent over her once more."
"She opened her eyes fully all of a sudden, looked at him intently, as
though realising something, got up from the seat and walked away in the
direction from which she had come."
"“Oh shameful wretches, they won’t let
me alone!” she said, waving her hand again."
"She walked quickly, though
staggering as before."
"The dandy followed her, but along another avenue,
keeping his eye on her."
"“Don’t be anxious, I won’t let him have her,” the policeman said
resolutely, and he set off after them."
"“Ah, the vice one sees nowadays!” he repeated aloud, sighing."
"At that moment something seemed to sting Raskolnikov; in an instant a
complete revulsion of feeling came over him."
"“Hey, here!” he shouted after the policeman."
The latter turned round.
“Let them be!
What is it to do with you?
Let her go!
"Let him amuse
himself.” He pointed at the dandy, “What is it to do with you?”

The policeman was bewildered, and stared at him open-eyed."
"Raskolnikov
laughed."
"“Well!” ejaculated the policeman, with a gesture of contempt, and he
walked after the dandy and the girl, probably taking Raskolnikov for a
madman or something even worse."
"“He has carried off my twenty copecks,” Raskolnikov murmured angrily
when he was left alone."
"“Well, let him take as much from the other
fellow to allow him to have the girl and so let it end."
"And why did I
want to interfere?"
Is it for me to help?
Have I any right to help?
"Let
them devour each other alive--what is it to me?"
"How did I dare to give him
twenty copecks?"
"Were they mine?”

In spite of those strange words he felt very wretched."
"He sat down on
the deserted seat."
His thoughts strayed aimlessly....
"He found it hard
to fix his mind on anything at that moment."
"He longed to forget himself
altogether, to forget everything, and then to wake up and begin life
anew....

“Poor girl!” he said, looking at the empty corner where she had
sat--“She will come to herself and weep, and then her mother will find
out.... She will give her a beating, a horrible, shameful beating and
then maybe, turn her out of doors.... And even if she does not, the
Darya Frantsovnas will get wind of it, and the girl will soon be
slipping out on the sly here and there."
"Then there will be the hospital
directly (that’s always the luck of those girls with respectable
mothers, who go wrong on the sly) and then... again the hospital...
drink... the taverns... and more hospital, in two or three years--a
wreck, and her life over at eighteen or nineteen.... Have not I seen
cases like that?"
And how have they been brought to it?
"Why, they’ve all
come to it like that."
Ugh!
But what does it matter?
"That’s as it should
be, they tell us."
"A certain percentage, they tell us, must every year
go... that way... to the devil, I suppose, so that the rest may remain
chaste, and not be interfered with."
A percentage!
"What splendid words
they have; they are so scientific, so consolatory.... Once you’ve said
‘percentage’ there’s nothing more to worry about."
"If we had any other
word... maybe we might feel more uneasy...."
"But what if Dounia were one
of the percentage!"
Of another one if not that one?
“But where am I going?” he thought suddenly.
"“Strange, I came out for
something."
As soon as I had read the letter I came out....
"I was going
to Vassilyevsky Ostrov, to Razumihin."
"That’s what it was... now I
remember."
"What for, though?"
"And what put the idea of going to Razumihin
into my head just now?"
"That’s curious.”

He wondered at himself."
"Razumihin was one of his old comrades at the
university."
"It was remarkable that Raskolnikov had hardly any friends at
the university; he kept aloof from everyone, went to see no one, and did
not welcome anyone who came to see him, and indeed everyone soon gave
him up."
"He took no part in the students’ gatherings, amusements or
conversations."
"He worked with great intensity without sparing himself,
and he was respected for this, but no one liked him."
"He was very poor,
and there was a sort of haughty pride and reserve about him, as though
he were keeping something to himself."
"He seemed to some of his comrades
to look down upon them all as children, as though he were superior in
development, knowledge and convictions, as though their beliefs and
interests were beneath him."
"With Razumihin he had got on, or, at least, he was more unreserved and
communicative with him."
"Indeed it was impossible to be on any other
terms with Razumihin."
"He was an exceptionally good-humoured and candid
youth, good-natured to the point of simplicity, though both depth and
dignity lay concealed under that simplicity."
"The better of his comrades
understood this, and all were fond of him."
"He was extremely intelligent,
though he was certainly rather a simpleton at times."
"He was of striking
appearance--tall, thin, blackhaired and always badly shaved."
"He was
sometimes uproarious and was reputed to be of great physical strength."
"One night, when out in a festive company, he had with one blow laid
a gigantic policeman on his back."
"There was no limit to his drinking
powers, but he could abstain from drink altogether; he sometimes went
too far in his pranks; but he could do without pranks altogether."
"Another thing striking about Razumihin, no failure distressed him, and
it seemed as though no unfavourable circumstances could crush him."
"He
could lodge anywhere, and bear the extremes of cold and hunger."
"He was
very poor, and kept himself entirely on what he could earn by work of
one sort or another."
"He knew of no end of resources by which to earn
money."
"He spent one whole winter without lighting his stove, and used to
declare that he liked it better, because one slept more soundly in
the cold."
"For the present he, too, had been obliged to give up the
university, but it was only for a time, and he was working with all his
might to save enough to return to his studies again."
"Raskolnikov had
not been to see him for the last four months, and Razumihin did not even
know his address."
"About two months before, they had met in the street,
but Raskolnikov had turned away and even crossed to the other side that
he might not be observed."
"And though Razumihin noticed him, he passed
him by, as he did not want to annoy him."
"CHAPTER V

“Of course, I’ve been meaning lately to go to Razumihin’s to ask for
work, to ask him to get me lessons or something...” Raskolnikov thought,
“but what help can he be to me now?"
"Suppose he gets me lessons, suppose
he shares his last farthing with me, if he has any farthings, so that
I could get some boots and make myself tidy enough to give lessons...
hm... Well and what then?"
"What shall I do with the few coppers I
earn?"
That’s not what I want now.
"It’s really absurd for me to go to
Razumihin....”

The question why he was now going to Razumihin agitated him even more
than he was himself aware; he kept uneasily seeking for some sinister
significance in this apparently ordinary action."
"“Could I have expected to set it all straight and to find a way out by
means of Razumihin alone?” he asked himself in perplexity."
"He pondered and rubbed his forehead, and, strange to say, after long
musing, suddenly, as if it were spontaneously and by chance, a fantastic
thought came into his head."
"“Hm... to Razumihin’s,” he said all at once, calmly, as though he had
reached a final determination."
"“I shall go to Razumihin’s of course,
but... not now."
"I shall go to him... on the next day after It, when It
will be over and everything will begin afresh....”

And suddenly he realised what he was thinking."
"“After It,” he shouted, jumping up from the seat, “but is It really
going to happen?"
"Is it possible it really will happen?” He left the
seat, and went off almost at a run; he meant to turn back, homewards,
but the thought of going home suddenly filled him with intense loathing;
in that hole, in that awful little cupboard of his, all _this_ had for a
month past been growing up in him; and he walked on at random."
"His nervous shudder had passed into a fever that made him feel
shivering; in spite of the heat he felt cold."
"With a kind of effort he
began almost unconsciously, from some inner craving, to stare at all
the objects before him, as though looking for something to distract his
attention; but he did not succeed, and kept dropping every moment into
brooding."
"When with a start he lifted his head again and looked round,
he forgot at once what he had just been thinking about and even where he
was going."
"In this way he walked right across Vassilyevsky Ostrov, came
out on to the Lesser Neva, crossed the bridge and turned towards the
islands."
"The greenness and freshness were at first restful to his weary
eyes after the dust of the town and the huge houses that hemmed him in
and weighed upon him."
"Here there were no taverns, no stifling closeness,
no stench."
"But soon these new pleasant sensations passed into morbid
irritability."
"Sometimes he stood still before a brightly painted summer
villa standing among green foliage, he gazed through the fence, he saw
in the distance smartly dressed women on the verandahs and balconies,
and children running in the gardens."
"The flowers especially caught his
attention; he gazed at them longer than at anything."
"He was met, too, by
luxurious carriages and by men and women on horseback; he watched them
with curious eyes and forgot about them before they had vanished from
his sight."
"Once he stood still and counted his money; he found he had
thirty copecks."
"“Twenty to the policeman, three to Nastasya for the
letter, so I must have given forty-seven or fifty to the Marmeladovs
yesterday,” he thought, reckoning it up for some unknown reason, but he
soon forgot with what object he had taken the money out of his pocket."
"He recalled it on passing an eating-house or tavern, and felt that he
was hungry...."
"Going into the tavern he drank a glass of vodka and ate a
pie of some sort."
He finished eating it as he walked away.
"It was a long
while since he had taken vodka and it had an effect upon him at once,
though he only drank a wineglassful."
"His legs felt suddenly heavy and
a great drowsiness came upon him."
"He turned homewards, but reaching
Petrovsky Ostrov he stopped completely exhausted, turned off the road
into the bushes, sank down upon the grass and instantly fell asleep."
"In a morbid condition of the brain, dreams often have a singular
actuality, vividness, and extraordinary semblance of reality."
"At times
monstrous images are created, but the setting and the whole picture are
so truth-like and filled with details so delicate, so unexpectedly, but
so artistically consistent, that the dreamer, were he an artist like
Pushkin or Turgenev even, could never have invented them in the waking
state."
"Such sick dreams always remain long in the memory and make a
powerful impression on the overwrought and deranged nervous system."
Raskolnikov had a fearful dream.
"He dreamt he was back in his childhood
in the little town of his birth."
"He was a child about seven years old,
walking into the country with his father on the evening of a holiday."
"It
was a grey and heavy day, the country was exactly as he remembered it;
indeed he recalled it far more vividly in his dream than he had done in
memory."
"The little town stood on a level flat as bare as the hand, not
even a willow near it; only in the far distance, a copse lay, a dark
blur on the very edge of the horizon."
"A few paces beyond the last market
garden stood a tavern, a big tavern, which had always aroused in him a
feeling of aversion, even of fear, when he walked by it with his father."
"There was always a crowd there, always shouting, laughter and abuse,
hideous hoarse singing and often fighting."
"Drunken and horrible-looking
figures were hanging about the tavern."
"He used to cling close to his
father, trembling all over when he met them."
"Near the tavern the road
became a dusty track, the dust of which was always black."
"It was a
winding road, and about a hundred paces further on, it turned to the
right to the graveyard."
"In the middle of the graveyard stood a stone
church with a green cupola where he used to go to mass two or three
times a year with his father and mother, when a service was held in
memory of his grandmother, who had long been dead, and whom he had never
seen."
"On these occasions they used to take on a white dish tied up in a
table napkin a special sort of rice pudding with raisins stuck in it in
the shape of a cross."
"He loved that church, the old-fashioned, unadorned
ikons and the old priest with the shaking head."
"Near his grandmother’s
grave, which was marked by a stone, was the little grave of his younger
brother who had died at six months old."
"He did not remember him at all,
but he had been told about his little brother, and whenever he visited
the graveyard he used religiously and reverently to cross himself and
to bow down and kiss the little grave."
"And now he dreamt that he was
walking with his father past the tavern on the way to the graveyard; he
was holding his father’s hand and looking with dread at the tavern."
"A
peculiar circumstance attracted his attention: there seemed to be
some kind of festivity going on, there were crowds of gaily dressed
townspeople, peasant women, their husbands, and riff-raff of all sorts,
all singing and all more or less drunk."
"Near the entrance of the tavern
stood a cart, but a strange cart."
"It was one of those big carts usually
drawn by heavy cart-horses and laden with casks of wine or other heavy
goods."
"He always liked looking at those great cart-horses, with their
long manes, thick legs, and slow even pace, drawing along a perfect
mountain with no appearance of effort, as though it were easier going
with a load than without it."
"But now, strange to say, in the shafts of
such a cart he saw a thin little sorrel beast, one of those peasants’
nags which he had often seen straining their utmost under a heavy load
of wood or hay, especially when the wheels were stuck in the mud or in
a rut."
"And the peasants would beat them so cruelly, sometimes even
about the nose and eyes, and he felt so sorry, so sorry for them that
he almost cried, and his mother always used to take him away from the
window."
"All of a sudden there was a great uproar of shouting, singing
and the balalaïka, and from the tavern a number of big and very drunken
peasants came out, wearing red and blue shirts and coats thrown over
their shoulders."
"“Get in, get in!” shouted one of them, a young thick-necked peasant with
a fleshy face red as a carrot."
"“I’ll take you all, get in!”

But at once there was an outbreak of laughter and exclamations in the
crowd."
"“Take us all with a beast like that!”

“Why, Mikolka, are you crazy to put a nag like that in such a cart?”

“And this mare is twenty if she is a day, mates!”

“Get in, I’ll take you all,” Mikolka shouted again, leaping first into
the cart, seizing the reins and standing straight up in front."
"“The bay
has gone with Matvey,” he shouted from the cart--“and this brute, mates,
is just breaking my heart, I feel as if I could kill her."
"She’s just
eating her head off."
"Get in, I tell you!"
I’ll make her gallop!
"She’ll
gallop!” and he picked up the whip, preparing himself with relish to
flog the little mare."
“Get in!
Come along!” The crowd laughed.
"“D’you hear, she’ll gallop!”

“Gallop indeed!"
"She has not had a gallop in her for the last ten years!”

“She’ll jog along!”

“Don’t you mind her, mates, bring a whip each of you, get ready!”

“All right!"
"Give it to her!”

They all clambered into Mikolka’s cart, laughing and making jokes."
"Six
men got in and there was still room for more."
"They hauled in a fat,
rosy-cheeked woman."
"She was dressed in red cotton, in a pointed, beaded
headdress and thick leather shoes; she was cracking nuts and laughing."
"The crowd round them was laughing too and indeed, how could they help
laughing?"
"That wretched nag was to drag all the cartload of them at a
gallop!"
"Two young fellows in the cart were just getting whips ready to
help Mikolka."
"With the cry of “now,” the mare tugged with all her might,
but far from galloping, could scarcely move forward; she struggled with
her legs, gasping and shrinking from the blows of the three whips which
were showered upon her like hail."
"The laughter in the cart and in the
crowd was redoubled, but Mikolka flew into a rage and furiously thrashed
the mare, as though he supposed she really could gallop."
"“Let me get in, too, mates,” shouted a young man in the crowd whose
appetite was aroused."
"“Get in, all get in,” cried Mikolka, “she will draw you all."
"I’ll beat
her to death!” And he thrashed and thrashed at the mare, beside himself
with fury."
"“Father, father,” he cried, “father, what are they doing?"
"Father, they
are beating the poor horse!”

“Come along, come along!” said his father."
"“They are drunken and
foolish, they are in fun; come away, don’t look!” and he tried to draw
him away, but he tore himself away from his hand, and, beside himself
with horror, ran to the horse."
The poor beast was in a bad way.
"She was
gasping, standing still, then tugging again and almost falling."
"“Beat her to death,” cried Mikolka, “it’s come to that."
"I’ll do for
her!”

“What are you about, are you a Christian, you devil?” shouted an old man
in the crowd."
“Did anyone ever see the like?
"A wretched nag like that pulling such a
cartload,” said another."
"“You’ll kill her,” shouted the third."
“Don’t meddle!
"It’s my property, I’ll do what I choose."
"Get in, more of
you!"
"Get in, all of you!"
"I will have her go at a gallop!...”

All at once laughter broke into a roar and covered everything: the mare,
roused by the shower of blows, began feebly kicking."
"Even the old man
could not help smiling."
"To think of a wretched little beast like that
trying to kick!"
"Two lads in the crowd snatched up whips and ran to the mare to beat her
about the ribs."
One ran each side.
"“Hit her in the face, in the eyes, in the eyes,” cried Mikolka."
"“Give us a song, mates,” shouted someone in the cart and everyone in the
cart joined in a riotous song, jingling a tambourine and whistling."
"The
woman went on cracking nuts and laughing."
...
"He ran beside the mare, ran in front of her, saw her being whipped
across the eyes, right in the eyes!"
"He was crying, he felt choking, his
tears were streaming."
"One of the men gave him a cut with the whip across
the face, he did not feel it."
"Wringing his hands and screaming, he
rushed up to the grey-headed old man with the grey beard, who was
shaking his head in disapproval."
"One woman seized him by the hand and
would have taken him away, but he tore himself from her and ran back to
the mare."
"She was almost at the last gasp, but began kicking once more."
"“I’ll teach you to kick,” Mikolka shouted ferociously."
"He threw down
the whip, bent forward and picked up from the bottom of the cart a long,
thick shaft, he took hold of one end with both hands and with an effort
brandished it over the mare."
"“He’ll crush her,” was shouted round him."
"“He’ll kill her!”

“It’s my property,” shouted Mikolka and brought the shaft down with a
swinging blow."
There was a sound of a heavy thud.
"“Thrash her, thrash her!"
"Why have you stopped?” shouted voices in the
crowd."
"And Mikolka swung the shaft a second time and it fell a second time
on the spine of the luckless mare."
"She sank back on her haunches, but
lurched forward and tugged forward with all her force, tugged first on
one side and then on the other, trying to move the cart."
"But the six
whips were attacking her in all directions, and the shaft was raised
again and fell upon her a third time, then a fourth, with heavy measured
blows."
Mikolka was in a fury that he could not kill her at one blow.
"“She’s a tough one,” was shouted in the crowd."
"“She’ll fall in a minute, mates, there will soon be an end of her,” said
an admiring spectator in the crowd."
“Fetch an axe to her!
"Finish her off,” shouted a third."
“I’ll show you!
"Stand off,” Mikolka screamed frantically; he threw down
the shaft, stooped down in the cart and picked up an iron crowbar."
"“Look
out,” he shouted, and with all his might he dealt a stunning blow at the
poor mare."
"The blow fell; the mare staggered, sank back, tried to pull,
but the bar fell again with a swinging blow on her back and she fell on
the ground like a log."
"“Finish her off,” shouted Mikolka and he leapt beside himself, out of
the cart."
"Several young men, also flushed with drink, seized anything
they could come across--whips, sticks, poles, and ran to the dying
mare."
"Mikolka stood on one side and began dealing random blows with the
crowbar."
"The mare stretched out her head, drew a long breath and died."
"“You butchered her,” someone shouted in the crowd."
"“Why wouldn’t she gallop then?”

“My property!” shouted Mikolka, with bloodshot eyes, brandishing the bar
in his hands."
"He stood as though regretting that he had nothing more to
beat."
"“No mistake about it, you are not a Christian,” many voices were
shouting in the crowd."
"But the poor boy, beside himself, made his way, screaming, through the
crowd to the sorrel nag, put his arms round her bleeding dead head and
kissed it, kissed the eyes and kissed the lips.... Then he jumped up and
flew in a frenzy with his little fists out at Mikolka."
"At that instant
his father, who had been running after him, snatched him up and carried
him out of the crowd."
"“Come along, come!"
"Let us go home,” he said to him."
“Father!
"Why did they... kill... the poor horse!” he sobbed, but his
voice broke and the words came in shrieks from his panting chest."
“They are drunk....
"They are brutal... it’s not our business!” said his
father."
"He put his arms round his father but he felt choked, choked."
"He
tried to draw a breath, to cry out--and woke up."
"He waked up, gasping for breath, his hair soaked with perspiration, and
stood up in terror."
"“Thank God, that was only a dream,” he said, sitting down under a tree
and drawing deep breaths."
“But what is it?
Is it some fever coming on?
"Such a hideous dream!”

He felt utterly broken: darkness and confusion were in his soul."
"He
rested his elbows on his knees and leaned his head on his hands."
"“Good God!” he cried, “can it be, can it be, that I shall really take an
axe, that I shall strike her on the head, split her skull open... that I
shall tread in the sticky warm blood, break the lock, steal and tremble;
hide, all spattered in the blood... with the axe.... Good God, can it
be?”

He was shaking like a leaf as he said this."
"“But why am I going on like this?” he continued, sitting up again, as it
were in profound amazement."
"“I knew that I could never bring myself
to it, so what have I been torturing myself for till now?"
"Yesterday,
yesterday, when I went to make that... _experiment_, yesterday I
realised completely that I could never bear to do it.... Why am I going
over it again, then?"
Why am I hesitating?
"As I came down the stairs
yesterday, I said myself that it was base, loathsome, vile, vile... the
very thought of it made me feel sick and filled me with horror."
"“No, I couldn’t do it, I couldn’t do it!"
"Granted, granted that there is
no flaw in all that reasoning, that all that I have concluded this last
month is clear as day, true as arithmetic.... My God!"
"Anyway I couldn’t
bring myself to it!"
"I couldn’t do it, I couldn’t do it!"
"Why, why then am
I still...?”

He rose to his feet, looked round in wonder as though surprised at
finding himself in this place, and went towards the bridge."
"He was pale,
his eyes glowed, he was exhausted in every limb, but he seemed suddenly
to breathe more easily."
"He felt he had cast off that fearful burden that
had so long been weighing upon him, and all at once there was a sense
of relief and peace in his soul."
"“Lord,” he prayed, “show me my path--I
renounce that accursed... dream of mine.”

Crossing the bridge, he gazed quietly and calmly at the Neva, at the
glowing red sun setting in the glowing sky."
"In spite of his weakness he
was not conscious of fatigue."
"It was as though an abscess that had been
forming for a month past in his heart had suddenly broken."
"Freedom,
freedom!"
"He was free from that spell, that sorcery, that obsession!"
"Later on, when he recalled that time and all that happened to him during
those days, minute by minute, point by point, he was superstitiously
impressed by one circumstance, which, though in itself not very
exceptional, always seemed to him afterwards the predestined
turning-point of his fate."
"He could never understand and explain to
himself why, when he was tired and worn out, when it would have been
more convenient for him to go home by the shortest and most direct way,
he had returned by the Hay Market where he had no need to go."
"It was
obviously and quite unnecessarily out of his way, though not much so."
"It
is true that it happened to him dozens of times to return home without
noticing what streets he passed through."
"But why, he was always asking
himself, why had such an important, such a decisive and at the same time
such an absolutely chance meeting happened in the Hay Market (where he
had moreover no reason to go) at the very hour, the very minute of his
life when he was just in the very mood and in the very circumstances
in which that meeting was able to exert the gravest and most decisive
influence on his whole destiny?"
"As though it had been lying in wait for
him on purpose!"
It was about nine o’clock when he crossed the Hay Market.
"At the tables
and the barrows, at the booths and the shops, all the market people were
closing their establishments or clearing away and packing up their
wares and, like their customers, were going home."
"Rag pickers and
costermongers of all kinds were crowding round the taverns in the dirty
and stinking courtyards of the Hay Market."
"Raskolnikov particularly
liked this place and the neighbouring alleys, when he wandered aimlessly
in the streets."
"Here his rags did not attract contemptuous attention,
and one could walk about in any attire without scandalising people."
"At
the corner of an alley a huckster and his wife had two tables set out
with tapes, thread, cotton handkerchiefs, etc."
"They, too, had got up to
go home, but were lingering in conversation with a friend, who had just
come up to them."
"This friend was Lizaveta Ivanovna, or, as everyone
called her, Lizaveta, the younger sister of the old pawnbroker, Alyona
Ivanovna, whom Raskolnikov had visited the previous day to pawn his
watch and make his _experiment_...."
"He already knew all about Lizaveta
and she knew him a little too."
"She was a single woman of about
thirty-five, tall, clumsy, timid, submissive and almost idiotic."
"She was
a complete slave and went in fear and trembling of her sister, who
made her work day and night, and even beat her."
"She was standing with
a bundle before the huckster and his wife, listening earnestly and
doubtfully."
They were talking of something with special warmth.
"The
moment Raskolnikov caught sight of her, he was overcome by a strange
sensation as it were of intense astonishment, though there was nothing
astonishing about this meeting."
"“You could make up your mind for yourself, Lizaveta Ivanovna,” the
huckster was saying aloud."
“Come round to-morrow about seven.
"They will
be here too.”

“To-morrow?” said Lizaveta slowly and thoughtfully, as though unable to
make up her mind."
"“Upon my word, what a fright you are in of Alyona Ivanovna,” gabbled
the huckster’s wife, a lively little woman."
"“I look at you, you are like
some little babe."
"And she is not your own sister either--nothing but a
step-sister and what a hand she keeps over you!”

“But this time don’t say a word to Alyona Ivanovna,” her husband
interrupted; “that’s my advice, but come round to us without asking."
It will be worth your while.
"Later on your sister herself may have a
notion.”

“Am I to come?”

“About seven o’clock to-morrow."
And they will be here.
"You will be able
to decide for yourself.”

“And we’ll have a cup of tea,” added his wife."
"“All right, I’ll come,” said Lizaveta, still pondering, and she began
slowly moving away."
Raskolnikov had just passed and heard no more.
"He passed softly,
unnoticed, trying not to miss a word."
"His first amazement was followed
by a thrill of horror, like a shiver running down his spine."
"He had
learnt, he had suddenly quite unexpectedly learnt, that the next day at
seven o’clock Lizaveta, the old woman’s sister and only companion, would
be away from home and that therefore at seven o’clock precisely the old
woman _would be left alone_."
He was only a few steps from his lodging.
"He went in like a man
condemned to death."
"He thought of nothing and was incapable of thinking;
but he felt suddenly in his whole being that he had no more freedom
of thought, no will, and that everything was suddenly and irrevocably
decided."
"Certainly, if he had to wait whole years for a suitable opportunity, he
could not reckon on a more certain step towards the success of the plan
than that which had just presented itself."
"In any case, it would have
been difficult to find out beforehand and with certainty, with
greater exactness and less risk, and without dangerous inquiries and
investigations, that next day at a certain time an old woman, on whose
life an attempt was contemplated, would be at home and entirely alone."
"CHAPTER VI

Later on Raskolnikov happened to find out why the huckster and his
wife had invited Lizaveta."
"It was a very ordinary matter and there was
nothing exceptional about it."
"A family who had come to the town and been
reduced to poverty were selling their household goods and clothes, all
women’s things."
"As the things would have fetched little in the market,
they were looking for a dealer."
This was Lizaveta’s business.
"She
undertook such jobs and was frequently employed, as she was very honest
and always fixed a fair price and stuck to it."
"She spoke as a rule
little and, as we have said already, she was very submissive and timid."
But Raskolnikov had become superstitious of late.
"The traces of
superstition remained in him long after, and were almost ineradicable."
"And in all this he was always afterwards disposed to see something
strange and mysterious, as it were, the presence of some peculiar
influences and coincidences."
"In the previous winter a student he knew
called Pokorev, who had left for Harkov, had chanced in conversation to
give him the address of Alyona Ivanovna, the old pawnbroker, in case he
might want to pawn anything."
"For a long while he did not go to her, for
he had lessons and managed to get along somehow."
"Six weeks ago he had
remembered the address; he had two articles that could be pawned: his
father’s old silver watch and a little gold ring with three red stones,
a present from his sister at parting."
He decided to take the ring.
"When
he found the old woman he had felt an insurmountable repulsion for her
at the first glance, though he knew nothing special about her."
"He got
two roubles from her and went into a miserable little tavern on his way
home."
"He asked for tea, sat down and sank into deep thought."
"A strange
idea was pecking at his brain like a chicken in the egg, and very, very
much absorbed him."
"Almost beside him at the next table there was sitting a student, whom he
did not know and had never seen, and with him a young officer."
"They had
played a game of billiards and began drinking tea."
"All at once he heard
the student mention to the officer the pawnbroker Alyona Ivanovna and
give him her address."
"This of itself seemed strange to Raskolnikov; he
had just come from her and here at once he heard her name."
"Of course
it was a chance, but he could not shake off a very extraordinary
impression, and here someone seemed to be speaking expressly for him;
the student began telling his friend various details about Alyona
Ivanovna."
"“She is first-rate,” he said."
“You can always get money from her.
"She is
as rich as a Jew, she can give you five thousand roubles at a time and
she is not above taking a pledge for a rouble."
"Lots of our fellows have
had dealings with her."
"But she is an awful old harpy....”

And he began describing how spiteful and uncertain she was, how if you
were only a day late with your interest the pledge was lost; how she
gave a quarter of the value of an article and took five and even seven
percent a month on it and so on."
"The student chattered on, saying
that she had a sister Lizaveta, whom the wretched little creature was
continually beating, and kept in complete bondage like a small child,
though Lizaveta was at least six feet high."
"“There’s a phenomenon for you,” cried the student and he laughed."
They began talking about Lizaveta.
"The student spoke about her with a
peculiar relish and was continually laughing and the officer listened
with great interest and asked him to send Lizaveta to do some mending
for him."
"Raskolnikov did not miss a word and learned everything about
her."
"Lizaveta was younger than the old woman and was her half-sister,
being the child of a different mother."
She was thirty-five.
"She worked
day and night for her sister, and besides doing the cooking and the
washing, she did sewing and worked as a charwoman and gave her sister
all she earned."
"She did not dare to accept an order or job of any kind
without her sister’s permission."
"The old woman had already made her
will, and Lizaveta knew of it, and by this will she would not get a
farthing; nothing but the movables, chairs and so on; all the money was
left to a monastery in the province of N----, that prayers might be
said for her in perpetuity."
"Lizaveta was of lower rank than her sister,
unmarried and awfully uncouth in appearance, remarkably tall with long
feet that looked as if they were bent outwards."
"She always wore battered
goatskin shoes, and was clean in her person."
"What the student expressed
most surprise and amusement about was the fact that Lizaveta was
continually with child."
“But you say she is hideous?” observed the officer.
"“Yes, she is so dark-skinned and looks like a soldier dressed up, but
you know she is not at all hideous."
"She has such a good-natured face
and eyes."
Strikingly so.
"And the proof of it is that lots of people are
attracted by her."
"She is such a soft, gentle creature, ready to put up
with anything, always willing, willing to do anything."
"And her smile is
really very sweet.”

“You seem to find her attractive yourself,” laughed the officer."
“From her queerness.
"No, I’ll tell you what."
"I could kill that damned
old woman and make off with her money, I assure you, without the
faintest conscience-prick,” the student added with warmth."
"The officer
laughed again while Raskolnikov shuddered."
How strange it was!
"“Listen, I want to ask you a serious question,” the student said hotly."
"“I was joking of course, but look here; on one side we have a stupid,
senseless, worthless, spiteful, ailing, horrid old woman, not simply
useless but doing actual mischief, who has not an idea what she is
living for herself, and who will die in a day or two in any case."
"You
understand?"
"You understand?”

“Yes, yes, I understand,” answered the officer, watching his excited
companion attentively."
"“Well, listen then."
"On the other side, fresh young lives thrown away for
want of help and by thousands, on every side!"
"A hundred thousand good
deeds could be done and helped, on that old woman’s money which will be
buried in a monastery!"
"Hundreds, thousands perhaps, might be set on the
right path; dozens of families saved from destitution, from ruin, from
vice, from the Lock hospitals--and all with her money."
"Kill her, take
her money and with the help of it devote oneself to the service of
humanity and the good of all."
"What do you think, would not one tiny
crime be wiped out by thousands of good deeds?"
"For one life thousands
would be saved from corruption and decay."
"One death, and a hundred lives
in exchange--it’s simple arithmetic!"
"Besides, what value has the life of
that sickly, stupid, ill-natured old woman in the balance of existence!"
"No more than the life of a louse, of a black-beetle, less in fact
because the old woman is doing harm."
"She is wearing out the lives of
others; the other day she bit Lizaveta’s finger out of spite; it almost
had to be amputated.”

“Of course she does not deserve to live,” remarked the officer, “but
there it is, it’s nature.”

“Oh, well, brother, but we have to correct and direct nature, and, but
for that, we should drown in an ocean of prejudice."
"But for that,
there would never have been a single great man."
"They talk of
duty, conscience--I don’t want to say anything against duty and
conscience;--but the point is, what do we mean by them?"
"Stay, I have
another question to ask you."
"Listen!”

“No, you stay, I’ll ask you a question."
"Listen!”

“Well?”

“You are talking and speechifying away, but tell me, would you kill the
old woman _yourself_?”

“Of course not!"
"I was only arguing the justice of it.... It’s nothing to
do with me....”

“But I think, if you would not do it yourself, there’s no justice about
it.... Let us have another game.”

Raskolnikov was violently agitated."
"Of course, it was all ordinary
youthful talk and thought, such as he had often heard before in
different forms and on different themes."
"But why had he happened to hear
such a discussion and such ideas at the very moment when his own brain
was just conceiving... _the very same ideas_?"
"And why, just at the
moment when he had brought away the embryo of his idea from the old
woman had he dropped at once upon a conversation about her?"
"This
coincidence always seemed strange to him."
"This trivial talk in a tavern
had an immense influence on him in his later action; as though there had
really been in it something preordained, some guiding hint....

*****

On returning from the Hay Market he flung himself on the sofa and sat
for a whole hour without stirring."
"Meanwhile it got dark; he had no
candle and, indeed, it did not occur to him to light up."
"He could never
recollect whether he had been thinking about anything at that time."
"At
last he was conscious of his former fever and shivering, and he realised
with relief that he could lie down on the sofa."
"Soon heavy, leaden sleep
came over him, as it were crushing him."
He slept an extraordinarily long time and without dreaming.
"Nastasya,
coming into his room at ten o’clock the next morning, had difficulty
in rousing him."
She brought him in tea and bread.
"The tea was again the
second brew and again in her own tea-pot."
"“My goodness, how he sleeps!” she cried indignantly."
"“And he is always
asleep.”

He got up with an effort."
"His head ached, he stood up, took a turn in
his garret and sank back on the sofa again."
"“Going to sleep again,” cried Nastasya."
"“Are you ill, eh?”

He made no reply."
"“Do you want some tea?”

“Afterwards,” he said with an effort, closing his eyes again and turning
to the wall."
Nastasya stood over him.
"“Perhaps he really is ill,” she said, turned and went out."
"She came in
again at two o’clock with soup."
He was lying as before.
"The tea stood
untouched."
"Nastasya felt positively offended and began wrathfully
rousing him."
"“Why are you lying like a log?” she shouted, looking at him with
repulsion."
"He got up, and sat down again, but said nothing and stared at the floor."
“Are you ill or not?” asked Nastasya and again received no answer.
"“You’d better go out and get a breath of air,” she said after a pause."
"“Will you eat it or not?”

“Afterwards,” he said weakly."
"“You can go.”

And he motioned her out."
"She remained a little longer, looked at him with compassion and went
out."
"A few minutes afterwards, he raised his eyes and looked for a long while
at the tea and the soup."
"Then he took the bread, took up a spoon and
began to eat."
"He ate a little, three or four spoonfuls, without appetite, as it were
mechanically."
His head ached less.
"After his meal he stretched himself
on the sofa again, but now he could not sleep; he lay without stirring,
with his face in the pillow."
"He was haunted by day-dreams and such
strange day-dreams; in one, that kept recurring, he fancied that he was
in Africa, in Egypt, in some sort of oasis."
"The caravan was resting,
the camels were peacefully lying down; the palms stood all around in a
complete circle; all the party were at dinner."
"But he was drinking water
from a spring which flowed gurgling close by."
"And it was so cool, it was
wonderful, wonderful, blue, cold water running among the parti-coloured
stones and over the clean sand which glistened here and there like
gold...."
Suddenly he heard a clock strike.
"He started, roused himself,
raised his head, looked out of the window, and seeing how late it was,
suddenly jumped up wide awake as though someone had pulled him off the
sofa."
"He crept on tiptoe to the door, stealthily opened it and began
listening on the staircase."
His heart beat terribly.
"But all was quiet
on the stairs as if everyone was asleep...."
"It seemed to him strange and
monstrous that he could have slept in such forgetfulness from the
previous day and had done nothing, had prepared nothing yet.... And
meanwhile perhaps it had struck six."
"And his drowsiness and stupefaction
were followed by an extraordinary, feverish, as it were distracted
haste."
But the preparations to be made were few.
"He concentrated all his
energies on thinking of everything and forgetting nothing; and his heart
kept beating and thumping so that he could hardly breathe."
"First he had
to make a noose and sew it into his overcoat--a work of a moment."
"He
rummaged under his pillow and picked out amongst the linen stuffed away
under it, a worn out, old unwashed shirt."
"From its rags he tore a long
strip, a couple of inches wide and about sixteen inches long."
"He folded
this strip in two, took off his wide, strong summer overcoat of some
stout cotton material (his only outer garment) and began sewing the two
ends of the rag on the inside, under the left armhole."
"His hands shook
as he sewed, but he did it successfully so that nothing showed outside
when he put the coat on again."
"The needle and thread he had got ready
long before and they lay on his table in a piece of paper."
"As for the
noose, it was a very ingenious device of his own; the noose was intended
for the axe."
"It was impossible for him to carry the axe through the
street in his hands."
"And if hidden under his coat he would still have
had to support it with his hand, which would have been noticeable."
"Now
he had only to put the head of the axe in the noose, and it would hang
quietly under his arm on the inside."
"Putting his hand in his coat
pocket, he could hold the end of the handle all the way, so that it did
not swing; and as the coat was very full, a regular sack in fact, it
could not be seen from outside that he was holding something with the
hand that was in the pocket."
"This noose, too, he had designed a
fortnight before."
"When he had finished with this, he thrust his hand into a little opening
between his sofa and the floor, fumbled in the left corner and drew out
the _pledge_, which he had got ready long before and hidden there."
"This
pledge was, however, only a smoothly planed piece of wood the size and
thickness of a silver cigarette case."
"He picked up this piece of wood
in one of his wanderings in a courtyard where there was some sort of
a workshop."
"Afterwards he had added to the wood a thin smooth piece
of iron, which he had also picked up at the same time in the street."
"Putting the iron which was a little the smaller on the piece of wood,
he fastened them very firmly, crossing and re-crossing the thread round
them; then wrapped them carefully and daintily in clean white paper and
tied up the parcel so that it would be very difficult to untie it."
"This
was in order to divert the attention of the old woman for a time, while
she was trying to undo the knot, and so to gain a moment."
"The iron strip
was added to give weight, so that the woman might not guess the first
minute that the “thing” was made of wood."
"All this had been stored by
him beforehand under the sofa."
"He had only just got the pledge out when
he heard someone suddenly about in the yard."
"“It struck six long ago.”

“Long ago!"
"My God!”

He rushed to the door, listened, caught up his hat and began to descend
his thirteen steps cautiously, noiselessly, like a cat."
"He had still the
most important thing to do--to steal the axe from the kitchen."
"That the
deed must be done with an axe he had decided long ago."
"He had also a
pocket pruning-knife, but he could not rely on the knife and still less
on his own strength, and so resolved finally on the axe."
"We may note in
passing, one peculiarity in regard to all the final resolutions taken by
him in the matter; they had one strange characteristic: the more final
they were, the more hideous and the more absurd they at once became in
his eyes."
"In spite of all his agonising inward struggle, he never for
a single instant all that time could believe in the carrying out of his
plans."
"And, indeed, if it had ever happened that everything to the least point
could have been considered and finally settled, and no uncertainty of
any kind had remained, he would, it seems, have renounced it all
as something absurd, monstrous and impossible."
"But a whole mass of
unsettled points and uncertainties remained."
"As for getting the axe,
that trifling business cost him no anxiety, for nothing could be easier."
"Nastasya was continually out of the house, especially in the evenings;
she would run in to the neighbours or to a shop, and always left the
door ajar."
"It was the one thing the landlady was always scolding her
about."
"And so, when the time came, he would only have to go quietly into
the kitchen and to take the axe, and an hour later (when everything
was over) go in and put it back again."
But these were doubtful points.
"Supposing he returned an hour later to put it back, and Nastasya had
come back and was on the spot."
"He would of course have to go by and wait
till she went out again."
"But supposing she were in the meantime to miss
the axe, look for it, make an outcry--that would mean suspicion or at
least grounds for suspicion."
"But those were all trifles which he had not even begun to consider, and
indeed he had no time."
"He was thinking of the chief point, and put off
trifling details, until _he could believe in it all_."
"But that seemed
utterly unattainable."
So it seemed to himself at least.
"He could not
imagine, for instance, that he would sometime leave off thinking, get
up and simply go there...."
Even his late experiment (i.e.
"his visit with
the object of a final survey of the place) was simply an attempt at
an experiment, far from being the real thing, as though one should say
“come, let us go and try it--why dream about it!”--and at once he
had broken down and had run away cursing, in a frenzy with himself."
"Meanwhile it would seem, as regards the moral question, that his
analysis was complete; his casuistry had become keen as a razor, and he
could not find rational objections in himself."
"But in the last resort
he simply ceased to believe in himself, and doggedly, slavishly sought
arguments in all directions, fumbling for them, as though someone were
forcing and drawing him to it."
"At first--long before indeed--he had been much occupied with one
question; why almost all crimes are so badly concealed and so easily
detected, and why almost all criminals leave such obvious traces?"
"He
had come gradually to many different and curious conclusions, and in his
opinion the chief reason lay not so much in the material impossibility
of concealing the crime, as in the criminal himself."
"Almost every
criminal is subject to a failure of will and reasoning power by a
childish and phenomenal heedlessness, at the very instant when prudence
and caution are most essential."
"It was his conviction that this eclipse
of reason and failure of will power attacked a man like a disease,
developed gradually and reached its highest point just before the
perpetration of the crime, continued with equal violence at the moment
of the crime and for longer or shorter time after, according to the
individual case, and then passed off like any other disease."
"The
question whether the disease gives rise to the crime, or whether the
crime from its own peculiar nature is always accompanied by something of
the nature of disease, he did not yet feel able to decide."
"When he reached these conclusions, he decided that in his own case there
could not be such a morbid reaction, that his reason and will would
remain unimpaired at the time of carrying out his design, for the
simple reason that his design was “not a crime....” We will omit all the
process by means of which he arrived at this last conclusion; we have
run too far ahead already.... We may add only that the practical, purely
material difficulties of the affair occupied a secondary position in his
mind."
"“One has but to keep all one’s will-power and reason to deal
with them, and they will all be overcome at the time when once one has
familiarised oneself with the minutest details of the business....” But
this preparation had never been begun."
"His final decisions were what he
came to trust least, and when the hour struck, it all came to pass quite
differently, as it were accidentally and unexpectedly."
"One trifling circumstance upset his calculations, before he had even
left the staircase."
"When he reached the landlady’s kitchen, the door
of which was open as usual, he glanced cautiously in to see whether, in
Nastasya’s absence, the landlady herself was there, or if not, whether
the door to her own room was closed, so that she might not peep out when
he went in for the axe."
"But what was his amazement when he suddenly
saw that Nastasya was not only at home in the kitchen, but was occupied
there, taking linen out of a basket and hanging it on a line."
"Seeing
him, she left off hanging the clothes, turned to him and stared at him
all the time he was passing."
"He turned away his eyes, and walked past as
though he noticed nothing."
"But it was the end of everything; he had not
the axe!"
He was overwhelmed.
"“What made me think,” he reflected, as he went under the gateway, “what
made me think that she would be sure not to be at home at that moment!"
"Why, why, why did I assume this so certainly?”

He was crushed and even humiliated."
"He could have laughed at himself in
his anger.... A dull animal rage boiled within him."
He stood hesitating in the gateway.
"To go into the street, to go a walk
for appearance’ sake was revolting; to go back to his room, even more
revolting."
"“And what a chance I have lost for ever!” he muttered,
standing aimlessly in the gateway, just opposite the porter’s little
dark room, which was also open."
Suddenly he started.
"From the porter’s
room, two paces away from him, something shining under the bench to the
right caught his eye...."
He looked about him--nobody.
"He approached the
room on tiptoe, went down two steps into it and in a faint voice called
the porter."
"“Yes, not at home!"
"Somewhere near though, in the yard, for
the door is wide open.” He dashed to the axe (it was an axe) and pulled
it out from under the bench, where it lay between two chunks of wood;
at once, before going out, he made it fast in the noose, he thrust both
hands into his pockets and went out of the room; no one had noticed him!"
"“When reason fails, the devil helps!” he thought with a strange grin."
This chance raised his spirits extraordinarily.
"He walked along quietly and sedately, without hurry, to avoid awakening
suspicion."
"He scarcely looked at the passers-by, tried to escape looking
at their faces at all, and to be as little noticeable as possible."
Suddenly he thought of his hat.
“Good heavens!
"I had the money the day
before yesterday and did not get a cap to wear instead!” A curse rose
from the bottom of his soul."
"Glancing out of the corner of his eye into a shop, he saw by a clock on
the wall that it was ten minutes past seven."
"He had to make haste and at
the same time to go someway round, so as to approach the house from the
other side...."
"When he had happened to imagine all this beforehand, he had sometimes
thought that he would be very much afraid."
"But he was not very much
afraid now, was not afraid at all, indeed."
"His mind was even occupied
by irrelevant matters, but by nothing for long."
"As he passed the Yusupov
garden, he was deeply absorbed in considering the building of great
fountains, and of their refreshing effect on the atmosphere in all
the squares."
"By degrees he passed to the conviction that if the summer
garden were extended to the field of Mars, and perhaps joined to the
garden of the Mihailovsky Palace, it would be a splendid thing and a
great benefit to the town."
"Then he was interested by the question why
in all great towns men are not simply driven by necessity, but in some
peculiar way inclined to live in those parts of the town where there
are no gardens nor fountains; where there is most dirt and smell and all
sorts of nastiness."
"Then his own walks through the Hay Market came back
to his mind, and for a moment he waked up to reality."
"“What nonsense!”
 he thought, “better think of nothing at all!”

“So probably men led to execution clutch mentally at every object that
meets them on the way,” flashed through his mind, but simply flashed,
like lightning; he made haste to dismiss this thought.... And by now
he was near; here was the house, here was the gate."
"Suddenly a clock
somewhere struck once."
“What!
can it be half-past seven?
"Impossible, it
must be fast!”

Luckily for him, everything went well again at the gates."
"At that very
moment, as though expressly for his benefit, a huge waggon of hay had
just driven in at the gate, completely screening him as he passed under
the gateway, and the waggon had scarcely had time to drive through into
the yard, before he had slipped in a flash to the right."
"On the other
side of the waggon he could hear shouting and quarrelling; but no one
noticed him and no one met him."
"Many windows looking into that huge
quadrangular yard were open at that moment, but he did not raise his
head--he had not the strength to."
"The staircase leading to the old
woman’s room was close by, just on the right of the gateway."
"He was
already on the stairs...."
"Drawing a breath, pressing his hand against his throbbing heart, and
once more feeling for the axe and setting it straight, he began softly
and cautiously ascending the stairs, listening every minute."
"But the
stairs, too, were quite deserted; all the doors were shut; he met no
one."
"One flat indeed on the first floor was wide open and painters were
at work in it, but they did not glance at him."
"He stood still, thought
a minute and went on."
"“Of course it would be better if they had not been
here, but... it’s two storeys above them.”

And there was the fourth storey, here was the door, here was the
flat opposite, the empty one."
"The flat underneath the old woman’s was
apparently empty also; the visiting card nailed on the door had been
torn off--they had gone away!..."
He was out of breath.
"For one instant
the thought floated through his mind “Shall I go back?” But he made no
answer and began listening at the old woman’s door, a dead silence."
"Then
he listened again on the staircase, listened long and intently...
then looked about him for the last time, pulled himself together, drew
himself up, and once more tried the axe in the noose."
"“Am I very pale?”
 he wondered."
“Am I not evidently agitated?
"She is mistrustful.... Had I
better wait a little longer... till my heart leaves off thumping?”

But his heart did not leave off."
"On the contrary, as though to spite
him, it throbbed more and more violently."
"He could stand it no longer,
he slowly put out his hand to the bell and rang."
"Half a minute later he
rang again, more loudly."
No answer.
To go on ringing was useless and out of place.
"The old woman
was, of course, at home, but she was suspicious and alone."
"He had some
knowledge of her habits... and once more he put his ear to the door."
"Either his senses were peculiarly keen (which it is difficult to
suppose), or the sound was really very distinct."
"Anyway, he suddenly
heard something like the cautious touch of a hand on the lock and the
rustle of a skirt at the very door."
"Someone was standing stealthily
close to the lock and just as he was doing on the outside was secretly
listening within, and seemed to have her ear to the door...."
"He moved
a little on purpose and muttered something aloud that he might not have
the appearance of hiding, then rang a third time, but quietly, soberly,
and without impatience, Recalling it afterwards, that moment stood out
in his mind vividly, distinctly, for ever; he could not make out how he
had had such cunning, for his mind was as it were clouded at moments and
he was almost unconscious of his body.... An instant later he heard the
latch unfastened."
"CHAPTER VII

The door was as before opened a tiny crack, and again two sharp and
suspicious eyes stared at him out of the darkness."
"Then Raskolnikov lost
his head and nearly made a great mistake."
"Fearing the old woman would be frightened by their being alone, and not
hoping that the sight of him would disarm her suspicions, he took
hold of the door and drew it towards him to prevent the old woman from
attempting to shut it again."
"Seeing this she did not pull the door back,
but she did not let go the handle so that he almost dragged her out with
it on to the stairs."
"Seeing that she was standing in the doorway not
allowing him to pass, he advanced straight upon her."
"She stepped back
in alarm, tried to say something, but seemed unable to speak and stared
with open eyes at him."
"“Good evening, Alyona Ivanovna,” he began, trying to speak easily, but
his voice would not obey him, it broke and shook."
“I have come...
"I have
brought something... but we’d better come in... to the light....”

And leaving her, he passed straight into the room uninvited."
"The old
woman ran after him; her tongue was unloosed."
“Good heavens!
What it is?
Who is it?
"What do you want?”

“Why, Alyona Ivanovna, you know me... Raskolnikov... here, I brought you
the pledge I promised the other day...” And he held out the pledge."
"The old woman glanced for a moment at the pledge, but at once stared in
the eyes of her uninvited visitor."
"She looked intently, maliciously and
mistrustfully."
"A minute passed; he even fancied something like a sneer
in her eyes, as though she had already guessed everything."
"He felt that
he was losing his head, that he was almost frightened, so frightened
that if she were to look like that and not say a word for another half
minute, he thought he would have run away from her."
"“Why do you look at me as though you did not know me?” he said suddenly,
also with malice."
"“Take it if you like, if not I’ll go elsewhere, I am
in a hurry.”

He had not even thought of saying this, but it was suddenly said of
itself."
"The old woman recovered herself, and her visitor’s resolute tone
evidently restored her confidence."
"“But why, my good sir, all of a minute.... What is it?” she asked,
looking at the pledge."
"“The silver cigarette case; I spoke of it last time, you know.”

She held out her hand."
"“But how pale you are, to be sure... and your hands are trembling too?"
"Have you been bathing, or what?”

“Fever,” he answered abruptly."
"“You can’t help getting pale... if you’ve
nothing to eat,” he added, with difficulty articulating the words."
His strength was failing him again.
"But his answer sounded like the
truth; the old woman took the pledge."
"“What is it?” she asked once more, scanning Raskolnikov intently, and
weighing the pledge in her hand."
"“A thing... cigarette case.... Silver.... Look at it.”

“It does not seem somehow like silver.... How he has wrapped it up!”

Trying to untie the string and turning to the window, to the light (all
her windows were shut, in spite of the stifling heat), she left
him altogether for some seconds and stood with her back to him."
"He
unbuttoned his coat and freed the axe from the noose, but did not yet
take it out altogether, simply holding it in his right hand under the
coat."
"His hands were fearfully weak, he felt them every moment growing
more numb and more wooden."
"He was afraid he would let the axe slip and
fall.... A sudden giddiness came over him."
"“But what has he tied it up like this for?” the old woman cried with
vexation and moved towards him."
He had not a minute more to lose.
"He pulled the axe quite out, swung
it with both arms, scarcely conscious of himself, and almost without
effort, almost mechanically, brought the blunt side down on her head."
"He
seemed not to use his own strength in this."
"But as soon as he had once
brought the axe down, his strength returned to him."
The old woman was as always bareheaded.
"Her thin, light hair, streaked
with grey, thickly smeared with grease, was plaited in a rat’s tail and
fastened by a broken horn comb which stood out on the nape of her neck."
"As she was so short, the blow fell on the very top of her skull."
"She
cried out, but very faintly, and suddenly sank all of a heap on the
floor, raising her hands to her head."
"In one hand she still held “the
pledge.” Then he dealt her another and another blow with the blunt side
and on the same spot."
"The blood gushed as from an overturned glass, the
body fell back."
"He stepped back, let it fall, and at once bent over her
face; she was dead."
"Her eyes seemed to be starting out of their sockets,
the brow and the whole face were drawn and contorted convulsively."
"He laid the axe on the ground near the dead body and felt at once in her
pocket (trying to avoid the streaming body)--the same right-hand pocket
from which she had taken the key on his last visit."
"He was in full
possession of his faculties, free from confusion or giddiness, but his
hands were still trembling."
"He remembered afterwards that he had been
particularly collected and careful, trying all the time not to get
smeared with blood...."
"He pulled out the keys at once, they were all,
as before, in one bunch on a steel ring."
"He ran at once into the bedroom
with them."
It was a very small room with a whole shrine of holy images.
"Against the other wall stood a big bed, very clean and covered with
a silk patchwork wadded quilt."
"Against a third wall was a chest of
drawers."
"Strange to say, so soon as he began to fit the keys into the
chest, so soon as he heard their jingling, a convulsive shudder passed
over him."
"He suddenly felt tempted again to give it all up and go
away."
But that was only for an instant; it was too late to go back.
"He positively smiled at himself, when suddenly another terrifying idea
occurred to his mind."
"He suddenly fancied that the old woman might be
still alive and might recover her senses."
"Leaving the keys in the chest,
he ran back to the body, snatched up the axe and lifted it once more
over the old woman, but did not bring it down."
"There was no doubt that
she was dead."
"Bending down and examining her again more closely, he saw
clearly that the skull was broken and even battered in on one side."
"He
was about to feel it with his finger, but drew back his hand and indeed
it was evident without that."
"Meanwhile there was a perfect pool of
blood."
"All at once he noticed a string on her neck; he tugged at it, but
the string was strong and did not snap and besides, it was soaked
with blood."
"He tried to pull it out from the front of the dress, but
something held it and prevented its coming."
"In his impatience he raised
the axe again to cut the string from above on the body, but did not
dare, and with difficulty, smearing his hand and the axe in the blood,
after two minutes’ hurried effort, he cut the string and took it off
without touching the body with the axe; he was not mistaken--it was a
purse."
"On the string were two crosses, one of Cyprus wood and one of
copper, and an image in silver filigree, and with them a small greasy
chamois leather purse with a steel rim and ring."
"The purse was stuffed
very full; Raskolnikov thrust it in his pocket without looking at it,
flung the crosses on the old woman’s body and rushed back into the
bedroom, this time taking the axe with him."
"He was in terrible haste, he snatched the keys, and began trying them
again."
But he was unsuccessful.
They would not fit in the locks.
"It
was not so much that his hands were shaking, but that he kept making
mistakes; though he saw for instance that a key was not the right one
and would not fit, still he tried to put it in."
"Suddenly he remembered
and realised that the big key with the deep notches, which was hanging
there with the small keys could not possibly belong to the chest of
drawers (on his last visit this had struck him), but to some strong box,
and that everything perhaps was hidden in that box."
"He left the chest
of drawers, and at once felt under the bedstead, knowing that old
women usually keep boxes under their beds."
"And so it was; there was a
good-sized box under the bed, at least a yard in length, with an arched
lid covered with red leather and studded with steel nails."
"The notched
key fitted at once and unlocked it."
"At the top, under a white sheet, was
a coat of red brocade lined with hareskin; under it was a silk dress,
then a shawl and it seemed as though there was nothing below but
clothes."
"The first thing he did was to wipe his blood-stained hands on
the red brocade."
"“It’s red, and on red blood will be less noticeable,”
 the thought passed through his mind; then he suddenly came to himself."
"“Good God, am I going out of my senses?” he thought with terror."
"But no sooner did he touch the clothes than a gold watch slipped from
under the fur coat."
He made haste to turn them all over.
"There turned
out to be various articles made of gold among the clothes--probably
all pledges, unredeemed or waiting to be redeemed--bracelets, chains,
ear-rings, pins and such things."
"Some were in cases, others simply
wrapped in newspaper, carefully and exactly folded, and tied round with
tape."
"Without any delay, he began filling up the pockets of his trousers
and overcoat without examining or undoing the parcels and cases; but he
had not time to take many...."
He suddenly heard steps in the room where the old woman lay.
"He stopped
short and was still as death."
"But all was quiet, so it must have been
his fancy."
"All at once he heard distinctly a faint cry, as though
someone had uttered a low broken moan."
"Then again dead silence for
a minute or two."
"He sat squatting on his heels by the box and waited
holding his breath."
"Suddenly he jumped up, seized the axe and ran out of
the bedroom."
In the middle of the room stood Lizaveta with a big bundle in her arms.
"She was gazing in stupefaction at her murdered sister, white as a sheet
and seeming not to have the strength to cry out."
"Seeing him run out
of the bedroom, she began faintly quivering all over, like a leaf, a
shudder ran down her face; she lifted her hand, opened her mouth, but
still did not scream."
"She began slowly backing away from him into the
corner, staring intently, persistently at him, but still uttered no
sound, as though she could not get breath to scream."
"He rushed at her
with the axe; her mouth twitched piteously, as one sees babies’ mouths,
when they begin to be frightened, stare intently at what frightens them
and are on the point of screaming."
"And this hapless Lizaveta was so
simple and had been so thoroughly crushed and scared that she did not
even raise a hand to guard her face, though that was the most necessary
and natural action at the moment, for the axe was raised over her face."
"She only put up her empty left hand, but not to her face, slowly holding
it out before her as though motioning him away."
"The axe fell with the
sharp edge just on the skull and split at one blow all the top of the
head."
She fell heavily at once.
"Raskolnikov completely lost his head,
snatching up her bundle, dropped it again and ran into the entry."
"Fear gained more and more mastery over him, especially after this
second, quite unexpected murder."
"He longed to run away from the place
as fast as possible."
"And if at that moment he had been capable of seeing
and reasoning more correctly, if he had been able to realise all the
difficulties of his position, the hopelessness, the hideousness and the
absurdity of it, if he could have understood how many obstacles and,
perhaps, crimes he had still to overcome or to commit, to get out of
that place and to make his way home, it is very possible that he would
have flung up everything, and would have gone to give himself up, and
not from fear, but from simple horror and loathing of what he had
done."
"The feeling of loathing especially surged up within him and grew
stronger every minute."
"He would not now have gone to the box or even
into the room for anything in the world."
"But a sort of blankness, even dreaminess, had begun by degrees to take
possession of him; at moments he forgot himself, or rather, forgot what
was of importance, and caught at trifles."
"Glancing, however, into the
kitchen and seeing a bucket half full of water on a bench, he bethought
him of washing his hands and the axe."
His hands were sticky with blood.
"He dropped the axe with the blade in the water, snatched a piece of soap
that lay in a broken saucer on the window, and began washing his hands
in the bucket."
"When they were clean, he took out the axe, washed the
blade and spent a long time, about three minutes, washing the wood where
there were spots of blood rubbing them with soap."
"Then he wiped it all
with some linen that was hanging to dry on a line in the kitchen and
then he was a long while attentively examining the axe at the window."
"There was no trace left on it, only the wood was still damp."
"He
carefully hung the axe in the noose under his coat."
"Then as far as was
possible, in the dim light in the kitchen, he looked over his overcoat,
his trousers and his boots."
"At the first glance there seemed to be
nothing but stains on the boots."
He wetted the rag and rubbed the boots.
"But he knew he was not looking thoroughly, that there might be something
quite noticeable that he was overlooking."
"He stood in the middle of the
room, lost in thought."
"Dark agonising ideas rose in his mind--the idea
that he was mad and that at that moment he was incapable of reasoning,
of protecting himself, that he ought perhaps to be doing something
utterly different from what he was now doing."
"“Good God!” he muttered “I
must fly, fly,” and he rushed into the entry."
"But here a shock of terror
awaited him such as he had never known before."
"He stood and gazed and could not believe his eyes: the door, the outer
door from the stairs, at which he had not long before waited and rung,
was standing unfastened and at least six inches open."
"No lock, no bolt,
all the time, all that time!"
"The old woman had not shut it after him
perhaps as a precaution."
"But, good God!"
"Why, he had seen Lizaveta
afterwards!"
"And how could he, how could he have failed to reflect that
she must have come in somehow!"
She could not have come through the wall!
He dashed to the door and fastened the latch.
"“But no, the wrong thing again!"
"I must get away, get away....”

He unfastened the latch, opened the door and began listening on the
staircase."
He listened a long time.
"Somewhere far away, it might be in the gateway,
two voices were loudly and shrilly shouting, quarrelling and scolding."
“What are they about?” He waited patiently.
"At last all was still, as
though suddenly cut off; they had separated."
"He was meaning to go out,
but suddenly, on the floor below, a door was noisily opened and someone
began going downstairs humming a tune."
"“How is it they all make such
a noise?” flashed through his mind."
"Once more he closed the door and
waited."
"At last all was still, not a soul stirring."
"He was just taking a
step towards the stairs when he heard fresh footsteps."
"The steps sounded very far off, at the very bottom of the stairs, but
he remembered quite clearly and distinctly that from the first sound he
began for some reason to suspect that this was someone coming _there_,
to the fourth floor, to the old woman."
Why?
"Were the sounds somehow
peculiar, significant?"
"The steps were heavy, even and unhurried."
"Now
_he_ had passed the first floor, now he was mounting higher, it was
growing more and more distinct!"
He could hear his heavy breathing.
"And
now the third storey had been reached."
Coming here!
"And it seemed to
him all at once that he was turned to stone, that it was like a dream
in which one is being pursued, nearly caught and will be killed, and is
rooted to the spot and cannot even move one’s arms."
"At last when the unknown was mounting to the fourth floor, he suddenly
started, and succeeded in slipping neatly and quickly back into the
flat and closing the door behind him."
"Then he took the hook and softly,
noiselessly, fixed it in the catch."
Instinct helped him.
"When he had
done this, he crouched holding his breath, by the door."
"The unknown
visitor was by now also at the door."
"They were now standing opposite one
another, as he had just before been standing with the old woman, when
the door divided them and he was listening."
The visitor panted several times.
"“He must be a big, fat man,” thought
Raskolnikov, squeezing the axe in his hand."
"It seemed like a dream
indeed."
The visitor took hold of the bell and rang it loudly.
"As soon as the tin bell tinkled, Raskolnikov seemed to be aware of
something moving in the room."
"For some seconds he listened quite
seriously."
"The unknown rang again, waited and suddenly tugged violently
and impatiently at the handle of the door."
"Raskolnikov gazed in horror
at the hook shaking in its fastening, and in blank terror expected every
minute that the fastening would be pulled out."
"It certainly did seem
possible, so violently was he shaking it."
"He was tempted to hold the
fastening, but _he_ might be aware of it."
"A giddiness came over him
again."
"“I shall fall down!” flashed through his mind, but the unknown
began to speak and he recovered himself at once."
“What’s up?
Are they asleep or murdered?
"D-damn them!” he bawled in a
thick voice, “Hey, Alyona Ivanovna, old witch!"
"Lizaveta Ivanovna, hey,
my beauty!"
open the door!
"Oh, damn them!"
"Are they asleep or what?”

And again, enraged, he tugged with all his might a dozen times at
the bell."
"He must certainly be a man of authority and an intimate
acquaintance."
"At this moment light hurried steps were heard not far off, on the
stairs."
Someone else was approaching.
"Raskolnikov had not heard them at
first."
"“You don’t say there’s no one at home,” the new-comer cried in a
cheerful, ringing voice, addressing the first visitor, who still went on
pulling the bell."
"“Good evening, Koch.”

“From his voice he must be quite young,” thought Raskolnikov."
“Who the devil can tell?
"I’ve almost broken the lock,” answered Koch."
"“But how do you come to know me?”

“Why!"
"The day before yesterday I beat you three times running at
billiards at Gambrinus’.”

“Oh!”

“So they are not at home?"
That’s queer.
It’s awfully stupid though.
Where could the old woman have gone?
"I’ve come on business.”

“Yes; and I have business with her, too.”

“Well, what can we do?"
"Go back, I suppose, Aie--aie!"
"And I was hoping to
get some money!” cried the young man."
"“We must give it up, of course, but what did she fix this time for?"
"The
old witch fixed the time for me to come herself."
It’s out of my way.
"And where the devil she can have got to, I can’t make out."
"She sits here
from year’s end to year’s end, the old hag; her legs are bad and yet
here all of a sudden she is out for a walk!”

“Hadn’t we better ask the porter?”

“What?”

“Where she’s gone and when she’ll be back.”

“Hm...."
Damn it all!...
We might ask....
"But you know she never does go
anywhere.”

And he once more tugged at the door-handle."
“Damn it all.
"There’s nothing to be done, we must go!”

“Stay!” cried the young man suddenly."
"“Do you see how the door shakes if
you pull it?”

“Well?”

“That shows it’s not locked, but fastened with the hook!"
"Do you hear how
the hook clanks?”

“Well?”

“Why, don’t you see?"
That proves that one of them is at home.
"If they
were all out, they would have locked the door from the outside with the
key and not with the hook from inside."
"There, do you hear how the hook
is clanking?"
"To fasten the hook on the inside they must be at home,
don’t you see."
"So there they are sitting inside and don’t open the
door!”

“Well!"
"And so they must be!” cried Koch, astonished."
"“What are they
about in there?” And he began furiously shaking the door."
“Stay!” cried the young man again.
“Don’t pull at it!
"There must be
something wrong...."
"Here, you’ve been ringing and pulling at the door
and still they don’t open!"
"So either they’ve both fainted or...”

“What?”

“I tell you what."
"Let’s go fetch the porter, let him wake them up.”

“All right.”

Both were going down."
“Stay.
"You stop here while I run down for the porter.”

“What for?”

“Well, you’d better.”

“All right.”

“I’m studying the law you see!"
"It’s evident, e-vi-dent there’s something
wrong here!” the young man cried hotly, and he ran downstairs."
Koch remained.
"Once more he softly touched the bell which gave one
tinkle, then gently, as though reflecting and looking about him, began
touching the door-handle pulling it and letting it go to make sure once
more that it was only fastened by the hook."
"Then puffing and panting he
bent down and began looking at the keyhole: but the key was in the lock
on the inside and so nothing could be seen."
Raskolnikov stood keeping tight hold of the axe.
"He was in a sort of
delirium."
He was even making ready to fight when they should come in.
"While they were knocking and talking together, the idea several times
occurred to him to end it all at once and shout to them through the
door."
"Now and then he was tempted to swear at them, to jeer at them,
while they could not open the door!"
"“Only make haste!” was the thought
that flashed through his mind."
"“But what the devil is he about?...” Time was passing, one minute, and
another--no one came."
Koch began to be restless.
"“What the devil?” he cried suddenly and in impatience deserting his
sentry duty, he, too, went down, hurrying and thumping with his heavy
boots on the stairs."
The steps died away.
“Good heavens!
"What am I to do?”

Raskolnikov unfastened the hook, opened the door--there was no sound."
"Abruptly, without any thought at all, he went out, closing the door as
thoroughly as he could, and went downstairs."
"He had gone down three flights when he suddenly heard a loud voice
below--where could he go!"
There was nowhere to hide.
"He was just going
back to the flat."
“Hey there!
"Catch the brute!”

Somebody dashed out of a flat below, shouting, and rather fell than ran
down the stairs, bawling at the top of his voice."
“Mitka!
Mitka!
Mitka!
Mitka!
Mitka!
"Blast him!”

The shout ended in a shriek; the last sounds came from the yard; all was
still."
"But at the same instant several men talking loud and fast began
noisily mounting the stairs."
There were three or four of them.
"He
distinguished the ringing voice of the young man."
"“Hey!”

Filled with despair he went straight to meet them, feeling “come what
must!” If they stopped him--all was lost; if they let him pass--all was
lost too; they would remember him."
"They were approaching; they were only
a flight from him--and suddenly deliverance!"
"A few steps from him on the
right, there was an empty flat with the door wide open, the flat on the
second floor where the painters had been at work, and which, as though
for his benefit, they had just left."
"It was they, no doubt, who had just
run down, shouting."
"The floor had only just been painted, in the middle
of the room stood a pail and a broken pot with paint and brushes."
"In one
instant he had whisked in at the open door and hidden behind the wall
and only in the nick of time; they had already reached the landing."
"Then they turned and went on up to the fourth floor, talking loudly."
"He
waited, went out on tiptoe and ran down the stairs."
"No one was on the stairs, nor in the gateway."
"He passed quickly through
the gateway and turned to the left in the street."
"He knew, he knew perfectly well that at that moment they were at the
flat, that they were greatly astonished at finding it unlocked, as
the door had just been fastened, that by now they were looking at the
bodies, that before another minute had passed they would guess and
completely realise that the murderer had just been there, and had
succeeded in hiding somewhere, slipping by them and escaping."
"They would
guess most likely that he had been in the empty flat, while they were
going upstairs."
"And meanwhile he dared not quicken his pace much, though
the next turning was still nearly a hundred yards away."
"“Should he
slip through some gateway and wait somewhere in an unknown street?"
"No,
hopeless!"
Should he fling away the axe?
Should he take a cab?
"Hopeless,
hopeless!”

At last he reached the turning."
He turned down it more dead than alive.
"Here he was half way to safety, and he understood it; it was less risky
because there was a great crowd of people, and he was lost in it like a
grain of sand."
"But all he had suffered had so weakened him that he could
scarcely move."
"Perspiration ran down him in drops, his neck was all wet."
"“My word, he has been going it!” someone shouted at him when he came out
on the canal bank."
"He was only dimly conscious of himself now, and the farther he went the
worse it was."
"He remembered however, that on coming out on to the canal
bank, he was alarmed at finding few people there and so being more
conspicuous, and he had thought of turning back."
"Though he was almost
falling from fatigue, he went a long way round so as to get home from
quite a different direction."
"He was not fully conscious when he passed through the gateway of his
house!"
He was already on the staircase before he recollected the axe.
"And yet he had a very grave problem before him, to put it back and to
escape observation as far as possible in doing so."
"He was of course
incapable of reflecting that it might perhaps be far better not to
restore the axe at all, but to drop it later on in somebody’s yard."
"But
it all happened fortunately, the door of the porter’s room was closed
but not locked, so that it seemed most likely that the porter was at
home."
"But he had so completely lost all power of reflection that he
walked straight to the door and opened it."
"If the porter had asked him,
“What do you want?” he would perhaps have simply handed him the axe."
"But
again the porter was not at home, and he succeeded in putting the axe
back under the bench, and even covering it with the chunk of wood as
before."
"He met no one, not a soul, afterwards on the way to his room;
the landlady’s door was shut."
"When he was in his room, he flung himself
on the sofa just as he was--he did not sleep, but sank into blank
forgetfulness."
"If anyone had come into his room then, he would have
jumped up at once and screamed."
"Scraps and shreds of thoughts were
simply swarming in his brain, but he could not catch at one, he could
not rest on one, in spite of all his efforts....




PART II



CHAPTER I

So he lay a very long while."
"Now and then he seemed to wake up, and at
such moments he noticed that it was far into the night, but it did not
occur to him to get up."
"At last he noticed that it was beginning to get
light."
"He was lying on his back, still dazed from his recent oblivion."
"Fearful, despairing cries rose shrilly from the street, sounds which he
heard every night, indeed, under his window after two o’clock."
"They woke
him up now."
“Ah!
"the drunken men are coming out of the taverns,” he thought, “it’s
past two o’clock,” and at once he leaped up, as though someone had
pulled him from the sofa."
“What!
"Past two o’clock!”

He sat down on the sofa--and instantly recollected everything!"
"All at
once, in one flash, he recollected everything."
For the first moment he thought he was going mad.
"A dreadful chill came
over him; but the chill was from the fever that had begun long before in
his sleep."
"Now he was suddenly taken with violent shivering, so that his
teeth chattered and all his limbs were shaking."
"He opened the door and
began listening--everything in the house was asleep."
"With amazement he
gazed at himself and everything in the room around him, wondering how he
could have come in the night before without fastening the door, and have
flung himself on the sofa without undressing, without even taking his
hat off."
It had fallen off and was lying on the floor near his pillow.
"“If anyone had come in, what would he have thought?"
"That I’m drunk
but...”

He rushed to the window."
"There was light enough, and he began hurriedly
looking himself all over from head to foot, all his clothes; were there
no traces?"
"But there was no doing it like that; shivering with cold, he
began taking off everything and looking over again."
"He turned everything
over to the last threads and rags, and mistrusting himself, went through
his search three times."
"But there seemed to be nothing, no trace, except in one place, where
some thick drops of congealed blood were clinging to the frayed edge
of his trousers."
"He picked up a big claspknife and cut off the frayed
threads."
There seemed to be nothing more.
"Suddenly he remembered that the purse and the things he had taken out of
the old woman’s box were still in his pockets!"
"He had not thought till
then of taking them out and hiding them!"
"He had not even thought of them
while he was examining his clothes!"
What next?
"Instantly he rushed
to take them out and fling them on the table."
"When he had pulled out
everything, and turned the pocket inside out to be sure there was
nothing left, he carried the whole heap to the corner."
"The paper had
come off the bottom of the wall and hung there in tatters."
"He began
stuffing all the things into the hole under the paper: “They’re in!"
"All
out of sight, and the purse too!” he thought gleefully, getting up and
gazing blankly at the hole which bulged out more than ever."
"Suddenly
he shuddered all over with horror; “My God!” he whispered in despair:
“what’s the matter with me?"
Is that hidden?
"Is that the way to hide
things?”

He had not reckoned on having trinkets to hide."
"He had only thought of
money, and so had not prepared a hiding-place."
"“But now, now, what am I glad of?” he thought, “Is that hiding things?"
"My reason’s deserting me--simply!”

He sat down on the sofa in exhaustion and was at once shaken by another
unbearable fit of shivering."
"Mechanically he drew from a chair beside
him his old student’s winter coat, which was still warm though almost in
rags, covered himself up with it and once more sank into drowsiness and
delirium."
He lost consciousness.
"Not more than five minutes had passed when he jumped up a second time,
and at once pounced in a frenzy on his clothes again."
“How could I go to sleep again with nothing done?
"Yes, yes; I have not
taken the loop off the armhole!"
"I forgot it, forgot a thing like that!"
"Such a piece of evidence!”

He pulled off the noose, hurriedly cut it to pieces and threw the bits
among his linen under the pillow."
"“Pieces of torn linen couldn’t rouse suspicion, whatever happened; I
think not, I think not, any way!” he repeated, standing in the middle
of the room, and with painful concentration he fell to gazing about
him again, at the floor and everywhere, trying to make sure he had not
forgotten anything."
"The conviction that all his faculties, even memory,
and the simplest power of reflection were failing him, began to be an
insufferable torture."
“Surely it isn’t beginning already!
"Surely it isn’t my punishment coming
upon me?"
"It is!”

The frayed rags he had cut off his trousers were actually lying on the
floor in the middle of the room, where anyone coming in would see them!"
"“What is the matter with me!” he cried again, like one distraught."
"Then a strange idea entered his head; that, perhaps, all his clothes
were covered with blood, that, perhaps, there were a great many
stains, but that he did not see them, did not notice them because
his perceptions were failing, were going to pieces... his reason was
clouded...."
"Suddenly he remembered that there had been blood on the
purse too."
“Ah!
"Then there must be blood on the pocket too, for I put
the wet purse in my pocket!”

In a flash he had turned the pocket inside out and, yes!--there were
traces, stains on the lining of the pocket!"
"“So my reason has not quite deserted me, so I still have some sense and
memory, since I guessed it of myself,” he thought triumphantly, with
a deep sigh of relief; “it’s simply the weakness of fever, a moment’s
delirium,” and he tore the whole lining out of the left pocket of his
trousers."
"At that instant the sunlight fell on his left boot; on the
sock which poked out from the boot, he fancied there were traces!"
"He
flung off his boots; “traces indeed!"
"The tip of the sock was soaked with
blood;” he must have unwarily stepped into that pool.... “But what am I
to do with this now?"
"Where am I to put the sock and rags and pocket?”

He gathered them all up in his hands and stood in the middle of the
room."
“In the stove?
But they would ransack the stove first of all.
Burn them?
But what can I burn them with?
There are no matches even.
"No, better
go out and throw it all away somewhere."
"Yes, better throw it away,” he
repeated, sitting down on the sofa again, “and at once, this minute,
without lingering...”

But his head sank on the pillow instead."
"Again the unbearable icy
shivering came over him; again he drew his coat over him."
"And for a long while, for some hours, he was haunted by the impulse to
“go off somewhere at once, this moment, and fling it all away, so that
it may be out of sight and done with, at once, at once!” Several times
he tried to rise from the sofa, but could not."
He was thoroughly waked up at last by a violent knocking at his door.
"“Open, do, are you dead or alive?"
"He keeps sleeping here!” shouted
Nastasya, banging with her fist on the door."
"“For whole days together
he’s snoring here like a dog!"
A dog he is too.
Open I tell you.
"It’s
past ten.”

“Maybe he’s not at home,” said a man’s voice."
“Ha!
"that’s the porter’s voice.... What does he want?”

He jumped up and sat on the sofa."
"The beating of his heart was a
positive pain."
“Then who can have latched the door?” retorted Nastasya.
"“He’s taken to
bolting himself in!"
As if he were worth stealing!
"Open, you stupid, wake
up!”

“What do they want?"
Why the porter?
All’s discovered.
Resist or open?
"Come what may!...”

He half rose, stooped forward and unlatched the door."
"His room was so small that he could undo the latch without leaving the
bed."
Yes; the porter and Nastasya were standing there.
Nastasya stared at him in a strange way.
"He glanced with a defiant and
desperate air at the porter, who without a word held out a grey folded
paper sealed with bottle-wax."
"“A notice from the office,” he announced, as he gave him the paper."
"“From what office?”

“A summons to the police office, of course."
"You know which office.”

“To the police?..."
"What for?...”

“How can I tell?"
"You’re sent for, so you go.”

The man looked at him attentively, looked round the room and turned to
go away."
"“He’s downright ill!” observed Nastasya, not taking her eyes off him."
The porter turned his head for a moment.
"“He’s been in a fever since
yesterday,” she added."
"Raskolnikov made no response and held the paper in his hands, without
opening it."
"“Don’t you get up then,” Nastasya went on compassionately,
seeing that he was letting his feet down from the sofa."
"“You’re ill, and
so don’t go; there’s no such hurry."
"What have you got there?”

He looked; in his right hand he held the shreds he had cut from his
trousers, the sock, and the rags of the pocket."
"So he had been asleep
with them in his hand."
"Afterwards reflecting upon it, he remembered that
half waking up in his fever, he had grasped all this tightly in his hand
and so fallen asleep again."
"“Look at the rags he’s collected and sleeps with them, as though he has
got hold of a treasure...”

And Nastasya went off into her hysterical giggle."
"Instantly he thrust them all under his great coat and fixed his
eyes intently upon her."
"Far as he was from being capable of rational
reflection at that moment, he felt that no one would behave like that
with a person who was going to be arrested."
"“But... the police?”

“You’d better have some tea!"
Yes?
"I’ll bring it, there’s some left.”

“No... I’m going; I’ll go at once,” he muttered, getting on to his feet."
"“Why, you’ll never get downstairs!”

“Yes, I’ll go.”

“As you please.”

She followed the porter out."
At once he rushed to the light to examine the sock and the rags.
"“There are stains, but not very noticeable; all covered with dirt,
and rubbed and already discoloured."
"No one who had no suspicion could
distinguish anything."
"Nastasya from a distance could not have noticed,
thank God!” Then with a tremor he broke the seal of the notice and began
reading; he was a long while reading, before he understood."
"It was an
ordinary summons from the district police-station to appear that day at
half-past nine at the office of the district superintendent."
“But when has such a thing happened?
"I never have anything to do with
the police!"
And why just to-day?” he thought in agonising bewilderment.
"“Good God, only get it over soon!”

He was flinging himself on his knees to pray, but broke into
laughter--not at the idea of prayer, but at himself."
"He began, hurriedly dressing."
"“If I’m lost, I am lost, I don’t care!"
"Shall I put the sock on?” he suddenly wondered, “it will get dustier
still and the traces will be gone.”

But no sooner had he put it on than he pulled it off again in loathing
and horror."
"He pulled it off, but reflecting that he had no other socks,
he picked it up and put it on again--and again he laughed."
"“That’s all conventional, that’s all relative, merely a way of looking
at it,” he thought in a flash, but only on the top surface of his
mind, while he was shuddering all over, “there, I’ve got it on!"
"I have
finished by getting it on!”

But his laughter was quickly followed by despair."
"“No, it’s too much for me...” he thought."
His legs shook.
"“From fear,”
 he muttered."
His head swam and ached with fever.
“It’s a trick!
"They
want to decoy me there and confound me over everything,” he mused, as
he went out on to the stairs--“the worst of it is I’m almost
light-headed..."
"I may blurt out something stupid...”

On the stairs he remembered that he was leaving all the things just as
they were in the hole in the wall, “and very likely, it’s on purpose
to search when I’m out,” he thought, and stopped short."
"But he was
possessed by such despair, such cynicism of misery, if one may so call
it, that with a wave of his hand he went on."
"“Only to get it over!”

In the street the heat was insufferable again; not a drop of rain had
fallen all those days."
"Again dust, bricks and mortar, again the stench
from the shops and pot-houses, again the drunken men, the Finnish
pedlars and half-broken-down cabs."
"The sun shone straight in his eyes,
so that it hurt him to look out of them, and he felt his head going
round--as a man in a fever is apt to feel when he comes out into the
street on a bright sunny day."
"When he reached the turning into _the_ street, in an agony of
trepidation he looked down it... at _the_ house... and at once averted
his eyes."
"“If they question me, perhaps I’ll simply tell,” he thought, as he drew
near the police-station."
The police-station was about a quarter of a mile off.
"It had lately been
moved to new rooms on the fourth floor of a new house."
"He had been once
for a moment in the old office but long ago."
"Turning in at the gateway,
he saw on the right a flight of stairs which a peasant was mounting with
a book in his hand."
"“A house-porter, no doubt; so then, the office is
here,” and he began ascending the stairs on the chance."
"He did not want
to ask questions of anyone."
"“I’ll go in, fall on my knees, and confess everything...” he thought, as
he reached the fourth floor."
"The staircase was steep, narrow and all sloppy with dirty water."
"The
kitchens of the flats opened on to the stairs and stood open almost
the whole day."
So there was a fearful smell and heat.
"The staircase
was crowded with porters going up and down with their books under their
arms, policemen, and persons of all sorts and both sexes."
"The door of
the office, too, stood wide open."
Peasants stood waiting within.
"There,
too, the heat was stifling and there was a sickening smell of fresh
paint and stale oil from the newly decorated rooms."
"After waiting a little, he decided to move forward into the next room."
All the rooms were small and low-pitched.
"A fearful impatience drew him
on and on."
No one paid attention to him.
"In the second room some
clerks sat writing, dressed hardly better than he was, and rather a
queer-looking set."
He went up to one of them.
"“What is it?”

He showed the notice he had received."
"“You are a student?” the man asked, glancing at the notice."
"“Yes, formerly a student.”

The clerk looked at him, but without the slightest interest."
"He was a
particularly unkempt person with the look of a fixed idea in his eye."
"“There would be no getting anything out of him, because he has no
interest in anything,” thought Raskolnikov."
"“Go in there to the head clerk,” said the clerk, pointing towards the
furthest room."
"He went into that room--the fourth in order; it was a small room and
packed full of people, rather better dressed than in the outer rooms."
Among them were two ladies.
"One, poorly dressed in mourning, sat at the
table opposite the chief clerk, writing something at his dictation."
"The other, a very stout, buxom woman with a purplish-red, blotchy face,
excessively smartly dressed with a brooch on her bosom as big as a
saucer, was standing on one side, apparently waiting for something."
Raskolnikov thrust his notice upon the head clerk.
"The latter glanced
at it, said: “Wait a minute,” and went on attending to the lady in
mourning."
He breathed more freely.
"“It can’t be that!”

By degrees he began to regain confidence, he kept urging himself to have
courage and be calm."
"“Some foolishness, some trifling carelessness, and I may betray myself!"
"Hm... it’s a pity there’s no air here,” he added, “it’s stifling...."
"It
makes one’s head dizzier than ever... and one’s mind too...”

He was conscious of a terrible inner turmoil."
"He was afraid of losing
his self-control; he tried to catch at something and fix his mind on it,
something quite irrelevant, but he could not succeed in this at all."
"Yet
the head clerk greatly interested him, he kept hoping to see through him
and guess something from his face."
"He was a very young man, about two and twenty, with a dark mobile
face that looked older than his years."
"He was fashionably dressed and
foppish, with his hair parted in the middle, well combed and pomaded,
and wore a number of rings on his well-scrubbed fingers and a gold chain
on his waistcoat."
"He said a couple of words in French to a foreigner who
was in the room, and said them fairly correctly."
"“Luise Ivanovna, you can sit down,” he said casually to the
gaily-dressed, purple-faced lady, who was still standing as though not
venturing to sit down, though there was a chair beside her."
"“Ich danke,” said the latter, and softly, with a rustle of silk she sank
into the chair."
"Her light blue dress trimmed with white lace floated
about the table like an air-balloon and filled almost half the room."
"She
smelt of scent."
"But she was obviously embarrassed at filling half
the room and smelling so strongly of scent; and though her smile was
impudent as well as cringing, it betrayed evident uneasiness."
"The lady in mourning had done at last, and got up."
"All at once, with
some noise, an officer walked in very jauntily, with a peculiar swing of
his shoulders at each step."
"He tossed his cockaded cap on the table and
sat down in an easy-chair."
"The small lady positively skipped from her
seat on seeing him, and fell to curtsying in a sort of ecstasy; but the
officer took not the smallest notice of her, and she did not venture to
sit down again in his presence."
He was the assistant superintendent.
"He
had a reddish moustache that stood out horizontally on each side of his
face, and extremely small features, expressive of nothing much except
a certain insolence."
"He looked askance and rather indignantly at
Raskolnikov; he was so very badly dressed, and in spite of his
humiliating position, his bearing was by no means in keeping with his
clothes."
"Raskolnikov had unwarily fixed a very long and direct look on
him, so that he felt positively affronted."
"“What do you want?” he shouted, apparently astonished that such a ragged
fellow was not annihilated by the majesty of his glance."
“I was summoned... by a notice...” Raskolnikov faltered.
"“For the recovery of money due, from _the student_,” the head clerk
interfered hurriedly, tearing himself from his papers."
"“Here!” and he
flung Raskolnikov a document and pointed out the place."
"“Read that!”

“Money?"
"What money?” thought Raskolnikov, “but... then... it’s certainly
not _that_.”

And he trembled with joy."
He felt sudden intense indescribable relief.
"A
load was lifted from his back."
"“And pray, what time were you directed to appear, sir?” shouted the
assistant superintendent, seeming for some unknown reason more and more
aggrieved."
"“You are told to come at nine, and now it’s twelve!”

“The notice was only brought me a quarter of an hour ago,” Raskolnikov
answered loudly over his shoulder."
"To his own surprise he, too, grew
suddenly angry and found a certain pleasure in it."
"“And it’s enough that
I have come here ill with fever.”

“Kindly refrain from shouting!”

“I’m not shouting, I’m speaking very quietly, it’s you who are shouting
at me."
"I’m a student, and allow no one to shout at me.”

The assistant superintendent was so furious that for the first minute he
could only splutter inarticulately."
He leaped up from his seat.
“Be silent!
You are in a government office.
"Don’t be impudent, sir!”

“You’re in a government office, too,” cried Raskolnikov, “and you’re
smoking a cigarette as well as shouting, so you are showing disrespect
to all of us.”

He felt an indescribable satisfaction at having said this."
The head clerk looked at him with a smile.
"The angry assistant
superintendent was obviously disconcerted."
“That’s not your business!” he shouted at last with unnatural loudness.
“Kindly make the declaration demanded of you.
Show him.
"Alexandr
Grigorievitch."
There is a complaint against you!
"You don’t pay your
debts!"
"You’re a fine bird!”

But Raskolnikov was not listening now; he had eagerly clutched at the
paper, in haste to find an explanation."
"He read it once, and a second
time, and still did not understand."
“What is this?” he asked the head clerk.
"“It is for the recovery of money on an I O U, a writ."
"You must
either pay it, with all expenses, costs and so on, or give a written
declaration when you can pay it, and at the same time an undertaking not
to leave the capital without payment, and nor to sell or conceal your
property."
"The creditor is at liberty to sell your property, and proceed
against you according to the law.”

“But I... am not in debt to anyone!”

“That’s not our business."
"Here, an I O U for a hundred and fifteen
roubles, legally attested, and due for payment, has been brought us
for recovery, given by you to the widow of the assessor Zarnitsyn, nine
months ago, and paid over by the widow Zarnitsyn to one Mr. Tchebarov."
"We therefore summon you, hereupon.”

“But she is my landlady!”

“And what if she is your landlady?”

The head clerk looked at him with a condescending smile of compassion,
and at the same time with a certain triumph, as at a novice under fire
for the first time--as though he would say: “Well, how do you feel now?”
 But what did he care now for an I O U, for a writ of recovery!"
"Was that
worth worrying about now, was it worth attention even!"
"He stood, he
read, he listened, he answered, he even asked questions himself, but
all mechanically."
"The triumphant sense of security, of deliverance from
overwhelming danger, that was what filled his whole soul that moment
without thought for the future, without analysis, without suppositions
or surmises, without doubts and without questioning."
"It was an instant
of full, direct, purely instinctive joy."
"But at that very moment
something like a thunderstorm took place in the office."
"The assistant
superintendent, still shaken by Raskolnikov’s disrespect, still fuming
and obviously anxious to keep up his wounded dignity, pounced on the
unfortunate smart lady, who had been gazing at him ever since he came in
with an exceedingly silly smile."
“You shameful hussy!” he shouted suddenly at the top of his voice.
"(The
lady in mourning had left the office.)"
"“What was going on at your house
last night?"
Eh!
"A disgrace again, you’re a scandal to the whole street."
Fighting and drinking again.
Do you want the house of correction?
"Why,
I have warned you ten times over that I would not let you off the
eleventh!"
"And here you are again, again, you... you...!”

The paper fell out of Raskolnikov’s hands, and he looked wildly at the
smart lady who was so unceremoniously treated."
"But he soon saw what it
meant, and at once began to find positive amusement in the scandal."
"He
listened with pleasure, so that he longed to laugh and laugh... all his
nerves were on edge."
"“Ilya Petrovitch!” the head clerk was beginning anxiously, but stopped
short, for he knew from experience that the enraged assistant could not
be stopped except by force."
"As for the smart lady, at first she positively trembled before the
storm."
"But, strange to say, the more numerous and violent the terms of
abuse became, the more amiable she looked, and the more seductive the
smiles she lavished on the terrible assistant."
"She moved uneasily, and
curtsied incessantly, waiting impatiently for a chance of putting in her
word: and at last she found it."
"“There was no sort of noise or fighting in my house, Mr. Captain,” she
pattered all at once, like peas dropping, speaking Russian confidently,
though with a strong German accent, “and no sort of scandal, and his
honour came drunk, and it’s the whole truth I am telling, Mr. Captain,
and I am not to blame...."
"Mine is an honourable house, Mr. Captain,
and honourable behaviour, Mr. Captain, and I always, always dislike any
scandal myself."
"But he came quite tipsy, and asked for three bottles
again, and then he lifted up one leg, and began playing the pianoforte
with one foot, and that is not at all right in an honourable house, and
he _ganz_ broke the piano, and it was very bad manners indeed and I said
so."
And he took up a bottle and began hitting everyone with it.
"And then
I called the porter, and Karl came, and he took Karl and hit him in the
eye; and he hit Henriette in the eye, too, and gave me five slaps on the
cheek."
"And it was so ungentlemanly in an honourable house, Mr. Captain,
and I screamed."
"And he opened the window over the canal, and stood in
the window, squealing like a little pig; it was a disgrace."
"The idea of
squealing like a little pig at the window into the street!"
Fie upon him!
"And Karl pulled him away from the window by his coat, and it is true,
Mr. Captain, he tore _sein rock_."
"And then he shouted that _man muss_
pay him fifteen roubles damages."
"And I did pay him, Mr. Captain, five
roubles for _sein rock_."
"And he is an ungentlemanly visitor and caused
all the scandal."
"‘I will show you up,’ he said, ‘for I can write to all
the papers about you.’”

“Then he was an author?”

“Yes, Mr. Captain, and what an ungentlemanly visitor in an honourable
house....”

“Now then!"
Enough!
"I have told you already...”

“Ilya Petrovitch!” the head clerk repeated significantly."
"The assistant glanced rapidly at him; the head clerk slightly shook his
head."
“...
"So I tell you this, most respectable Luise Ivanovna, and I tell it
you for the last time,” the assistant went on."
"“If there is a scandal
in your honourable house once again, I will put you yourself in the
lock-up, as it is called in polite society."
Do you hear?
"So a literary
man, an author took five roubles for his coat-tail in an ‘honourable
house’?"
"A nice set, these authors!”

And he cast a contemptuous glance at Raskolnikov."
"“There was a scandal
the other day in a restaurant, too."
"An author had eaten his dinner and
would not pay; ‘I’ll write a satire on you,’ says he."
"And there was
another of them on a steamer last week used the most disgraceful
language to the respectable family of a civil councillor, his wife and
daughter."
"And there was one of them turned out of a confectioner’s shop
the other day."
"They are like that, authors, literary men, students,
town-criers.... Pfoo!"
You get along!
"I shall look in upon you myself one
day."
Then you had better be careful!
"Do you hear?”

With hurried deference, Luise Ivanovna fell to curtsying in all
directions, and so curtsied herself to the door."
"But at the door, she
stumbled backwards against a good-looking officer with a fresh, open
face and splendid thick fair whiskers."
"This was the superintendent of
the district himself, Nikodim Fomitch."
"Luise Ivanovna made haste
to curtsy almost to the ground, and with mincing little steps, she
fluttered out of the office."
"“Again thunder and lightning--a hurricane!” said Nikodim Fomitch to Ilya
Petrovitch in a civil and friendly tone."
"“You are aroused again, you are
fuming again!"
"I heard it on the stairs!”

“Well, what then!” Ilya Petrovitch drawled with gentlemanly nonchalance;
and he walked with some papers to another table, with a jaunty swing of
his shoulders at each step."
"“Here, if you will kindly look: an author,
or a student, has been one at least, does not pay his debts, has given
an I O U, won’t clear out of his room, and complaints are constantly
being lodged against him, and here he has been pleased to make a protest
against my smoking in his presence!"
"He behaves like a cad himself, and
just look at him, please."
"Here’s the gentleman, and very attractive he
is!”

“Poverty is not a vice, my friend, but we know you go off like powder,
you can’t bear a slight, I daresay you took offence at something and
went too far yourself,” continued Nikodim Fomitch, turning affably to
Raskolnikov."
"“But you were wrong there; he is a capital fellow, I assure
you, but explosive, explosive!"
"He gets hot, fires up, boils over, and no
stopping him!"
And then it’s all over!
"And at the bottom he’s a heart of
gold!"
"His nickname in the regiment was the Explosive Lieutenant....”

“And what a regiment it was, too,” cried Ilya Petrovitch, much gratified
at this agreeable banter, though still sulky."
"Raskolnikov had a sudden desire to say something exceptionally pleasant
to them all."
"“Excuse me, Captain,” he began easily, suddenly addressing
Nikodim Fomitch, “will you enter into my position?..."
"I am ready to
ask pardon, if I have been ill-mannered."
"I am a poor student, sick
and shattered (shattered was the word he used) by poverty."
"I am not
studying, because I cannot keep myself now, but I shall get money...."
"I
have a mother and sister in the province of X."
"They will send it to
me, and I will pay."
"My landlady is a good-hearted woman, but she is so
exasperated at my having lost my lessons, and not paying her for the
last four months, that she does not even send up my dinner... and I
don’t understand this I O U at all."
"She is asking me to pay her on this
I O U."
How am I to pay her?
"Judge for yourselves!...”

“But that is not our business, you know,” the head clerk was observing."
"“Yes, yes."
I perfectly agree with you.
"But allow me to explain...”
 Raskolnikov put in again, still addressing Nikodim Fomitch, but trying
his best to address Ilya Petrovitch also, though the latter persistently
appeared to be rummaging among his papers and to be contemptuously
oblivious of him."
"“Allow me to explain that I have been living with her
for nearly three years and at first... at first... for why should I not
confess it, at the very beginning I promised to marry her daughter, it
was a verbal promise, freely given... she was a girl... indeed, I liked
her, though I was not in love with her... a youthful affair in fact...
that is, I mean to say, that my landlady gave me credit freely in those
days, and I led a life of..."
"I was very heedless...”

“Nobody asks you for these personal details, sir, we’ve no time to
waste,” Ilya Petrovitch interposed roughly and with a note of triumph;
but Raskolnikov stopped him hotly, though he suddenly found it
exceedingly difficult to speak."
"“But excuse me, excuse me."
"It is for me to explain... how it all
happened..."
In my turn... though I agree with you... it is unnecessary.
"But a year ago, the girl died of typhus."
"I remained lodging there as
before, and when my landlady moved into her present quarters, she said
to me... and in a friendly way... that she had complete trust in me,
but still, would I not give her an I O U for one hundred and fifteen
roubles, all the debt I owed her."
"She said if only I gave her that,
she would trust me again, as much as I liked, and that she would never,
never--those were her own words--make use of that I O U till I could pay
of myself... and now, when I have lost my lessons and have nothing to
eat, she takes action against me."
"What am I to say to that?”

“All these affecting details are no business of ours.” Ilya Petrovitch
interrupted rudely."
"“You must give a written undertaking but as for your
love affairs and all these tragic events, we have nothing to do with
that.”

“Come now... you are harsh,” muttered Nikodim Fomitch, sitting down at
the table and also beginning to write."
He looked a little ashamed.
“Write!” said the head clerk to Raskolnikov.
"“Write what?” the latter asked, gruffly."
"“I will dictate to you.”

Raskolnikov fancied that the head clerk treated him more casually and
contemptuously after his speech, but strange to say he suddenly felt
completely indifferent to anyone’s opinion, and this revulsion took
place in a flash, in one instant."
"If he had cared to think a little,
he would have been amazed indeed that he could have talked to them like
that a minute before, forcing his feelings upon them."
"And where had
those feelings come from?"
"Now if the whole room had been filled, not
with police officers, but with those nearest and dearest to him, he
would not have found one human word for them, so empty was his heart."
"A
gloomy sensation of agonising, everlasting solitude and remoteness, took
conscious form in his soul."
"It was not the meanness of his sentimental
effusions before Ilya Petrovitch, nor the meanness of the latter’s
triumph over him that had caused this sudden revulsion in his heart."
"Oh, what had he to do now with his own baseness, with all these petty
vanities, officers, German women, debts, police-offices?"
"If he had been
sentenced to be burnt at that moment, he would not have stirred, would
hardly have heard the sentence to the end."
"Something was happening to
him entirely new, sudden and unknown."
"It was not that he understood, but
he felt clearly with all the intensity of sensation that he could
never more appeal to these people in the police-office with sentimental
effusions like his recent outburst, or with anything whatever; and that
if they had been his own brothers and sisters and not police-officers,
it would have been utterly out of the question to appeal to them in any
circumstance of life."
"He had never experienced such a strange and awful
sensation."
"And what was most agonising--it was more a sensation than a
conception or idea, a direct sensation, the most agonising of all the
sensations he had known in his life."
"The head clerk began dictating to him the usual form of declaration,
that he could not pay, that he undertook to do so at a future date, that
he would not leave the town, nor sell his property, and so on."
"“But you can’t write, you can hardly hold the pen,” observed the head
clerk, looking with curiosity at Raskolnikov."
"“Are you ill?”

“Yes, I am giddy."
"Go on!”

“That’s all."
"Sign it.”

The head clerk took the paper, and turned to attend to others."
"Raskolnikov gave back the pen; but instead of getting up and going away,
he put his elbows on the table and pressed his head in his hands."
"He
felt as if a nail were being driven into his skull."
"A strange idea
suddenly occurred to him, to get up at once, to go up to Nikodim
Fomitch, and tell him everything that had happened yesterday, and then
to go with him to his lodgings and to show him the things in the hole
in the corner."
"The impulse was so strong that he got up from his seat
to carry it out."
"“Hadn’t I better think a minute?” flashed through his
mind."
"“No, better cast off the burden without thinking.” But all at once
he stood still, rooted to the spot."
"Nikodim Fomitch was talking eagerly
with Ilya Petrovitch, and the words reached him:

“It’s impossible, they’ll both be released."
"To begin with, the whole
story contradicts itself."
"Why should they have called the porter, if it
had been their doing?"
To inform against themselves?
Or as a blind?
"No,
that would be too cunning!"
"Besides, Pestryakov, the student, was seen at
the gate by both the porters and a woman as he went in."
"He was walking
with three friends, who left him only at the gate, and he asked the
porters to direct him, in the presence of the friends."
"Now, would he
have asked his way if he had been going with such an object?"
"As for
Koch, he spent half an hour at the silversmith’s below, before he went
up to the old woman and he left him at exactly a quarter to eight."
"Now
just consider...”

“But excuse me, how do you explain this contradiction?"
"They state
themselves that they knocked and the door was locked; yet three minutes
later when they went up with the porter, it turned out the door was
unfastened.”

“That’s just it; the murderer must have been there and bolted himself
in; and they’d have caught him for a certainty if Koch had not been
an ass and gone to look for the porter too."
"_He_ must have seized the
interval to get downstairs and slip by them somehow."
"Koch keeps crossing
himself and saying: ‘If I had been there, he would have jumped out and
killed me with his axe.’ He is going to have a thanksgiving service--ha,
ha!”

“And no one saw the murderer?”

“They might well not see him; the house is a regular Noah’s Ark,” said
the head clerk, who was listening."
"“It’s clear, quite clear,” Nikodim Fomitch repeated warmly."
"“No, it is anything but clear,” Ilya Petrovitch maintained."
"Raskolnikov picked up his hat and walked towards the door, but he did
not reach it...."
"When he recovered consciousness, he found himself sitting in a chair,
supported by someone on the right side, while someone else was standing
on the left, holding a yellowish glass filled with yellow water, and
Nikodim Fomitch standing before him, looking intently at him."
"He got up
from the chair."
“What’s this?
"Are you ill?” Nikodim Fomitch asked, rather sharply."
"“He could hardly hold his pen when he was signing,” said the head clerk,
settling back in his place, and taking up his work again."
"“Have you been ill long?” cried Ilya Petrovitch from his place, where
he, too, was looking through papers."
"He had, of course, come to look at
the sick man when he fainted, but retired at once when he recovered."
"“Since yesterday,” muttered Raskolnikov in reply."
"“Did you go out yesterday?”

“Yes.”

“Though you were ill?”

“Yes.”

“At what time?”

“About seven.”

“And where did you go, may I ask?”

“Along the street.”

“Short and clear.”

Raskolnikov, white as a handkerchief, had answered sharply, jerkily,
without dropping his black feverish eyes before Ilya Petrovitch’s stare."
“He can scarcely stand upright.
"And you...” Nikodim Fomitch was
beginning."
"“No matter,” Ilya Petrovitch pronounced rather peculiarly."
"Nikodim Fomitch would have made some further protest, but glancing at
the head clerk who was looking very hard at him, he did not speak."
"There
was a sudden silence."
It was strange.
"“Very well, then,” concluded Ilya Petrovitch, “we will not detain you.”

Raskolnikov went out."
"He caught the sound of eager conversation on his
departure, and above the rest rose the questioning voice of Nikodim
Fomitch."
"In the street, his faintness passed off completely."
"“A search--there will be a search at once,” he repeated to himself,
hurrying home."
“The brutes!
"they suspect.”

His former terror mastered him completely again."
"CHAPTER II

“And what if there has been a search already?"
"What if I find them in my
room?”

But here was his room."
Nothing and no one in it.
No one had peeped in.
Even Nastasya had not touched it.
But heavens!
"how could he have left
all those things in the hole?"
"He rushed to the corner, slipped his hand under the paper, pulled the
things out and lined his pockets with them."
"There were eight articles in
all: two little boxes with ear-rings or something of the sort, he hardly
looked to see; then four small leather cases."
"There was a chain, too,
merely wrapped in newspaper and something else in newspaper, that looked
like a decoration...."
"He put them all in the different pockets of his
overcoat, and the remaining pocket of his trousers, trying to conceal
them as much as possible."
"He took the purse, too."
"Then he went out of
his room, leaving the door open."
"He walked quickly and resolutely, and
though he felt shattered, he had his senses about him."
"He was afraid of
pursuit, he was afraid that in another half-hour, another quarter of an
hour perhaps, instructions would be issued for his pursuit, and so at
all costs, he must hide all traces before then."
"He must clear everything
up while he still had some strength, some reasoning power left him....
Where was he to go?"
"That had long been settled: “Fling them into the canal, and all traces
hidden in the water, the thing would be at an end.” So he had decided in
the night of his delirium when several times he had had the impulse to
get up and go away, to make haste, and get rid of it all."
"But to get
rid of it, turned out to be a very difficult task."
"He wandered along
the bank of the Ekaterininsky Canal for half an hour or more and looked
several times at the steps running down to the water, but he could not
think of carrying out his plan; either rafts stood at the steps’ edge,
and women were washing clothes on them, or boats were moored there, and
people were swarming everywhere."
"Moreover he could be seen and noticed
from the banks on all sides; it would look suspicious for a man to go
down on purpose, stop, and throw something into the water."
"And what if
the boxes were to float instead of sinking?"
And of course they would.
"Even as it was, everyone he met seemed to stare and look round, as if
they had nothing to do but to watch him."
"“Why is it, or can it be my
fancy?” he thought."
"At last the thought struck him that it might be better to go to the
Neva."
"There were not so many people there, he would be less observed,
and it would be more convenient in every way, above all it was further
off."
"He wondered how he could have been wandering for a good half-hour,
worried and anxious in this dangerous past without thinking of it
before."
"And that half-hour he had lost over an irrational plan, simply
because he had thought of it in delirium!"
"He had become extremely absent
and forgetful and he was aware of it."
He certainly must make haste.
"He walked towards the Neva along V---- Prospect, but on the way
another idea struck him."
“Why to the Neva?
"Would it not be better to go
somewhere far off, to the Islands again, and there hide the things
in some solitary place, in a wood or under a bush, and mark the spot
perhaps?” And though he felt incapable of clear judgment, the idea
seemed to him a sound one."
But he was not destined to go there.
"For
coming out of V---- Prospect towards the square, he saw on the left a
passage leading between two blank walls to a courtyard."
"On the right
hand, the blank unwhitewashed wall of a four-storied house stretched far
into the court; on the left, a wooden hoarding ran parallel with it for
twenty paces into the court, and then turned sharply to the left."
"Here
was a deserted fenced-off place where rubbish of different sorts was
lying."
"At the end of the court, the corner of a low, smutty, stone shed,
apparently part of some workshop, peeped from behind the hoarding."
"It
was probably a carriage builder’s or carpenter’s shed; the whole place
from the entrance was black with coal dust."
"Here would be the place to
throw it, he thought."
"Not seeing anyone in the yard, he slipped in, and
at once saw near the gate a sink, such as is often put in yards where
there are many workmen or cab-drivers; and on the hoarding above had
been scribbled in chalk the time-honoured witticism, “Standing here
strictly forbidden.” This was all the better, for there would be nothing
suspicious about his going in."
"“Here I could throw it all in a heap and
get away!”

Looking round once more, with his hand already in his pocket, he noticed
against the outer wall, between the entrance and the sink, a big unhewn
stone, weighing perhaps sixty pounds."
"The other side of the wall was a
street."
"He could hear passers-by, always numerous in that part, but he
could not be seen from the entrance, unless someone came in from the
street, which might well happen indeed, so there was need of haste."
"He bent down over the stone, seized the top of it firmly in both hands,
and using all his strength turned it over."
"Under the stone was a small
hollow in the ground, and he immediately emptied his pocket into it."
"The purse lay at the top, and yet the hollow was not filled up."
"Then he
seized the stone again and with one twist turned it back, so that it was
in the same position again, though it stood a very little higher."
"But
he scraped the earth about it and pressed it at the edges with his foot."
Nothing could be noticed.
"Then he went out, and turned into the square."
"Again an intense,
almost unbearable joy overwhelmed him for an instant, as it had in
the police-office."
“I have buried my tracks!
"And who, who can think of
looking under that stone?"
"It has been lying there most likely ever since
the house was built, and will lie as many years more."
"And if it were
found, who would think of me?"
It is all over!
No clue!” And he laughed.
"Yes, he remembered that he began laughing a thin, nervous noiseless
laugh, and went on laughing all the time he was crossing the square."
"But
when he reached the K---- Boulevard where two days before he had come
upon that girl, his laughter suddenly ceased."
"Other ideas crept into his
mind."
"He felt all at once that it would be loathsome to pass that seat
on which after the girl was gone, he had sat and pondered, and that it
would be hateful, too, to meet that whiskered policeman to whom he had
given the twenty copecks: “Damn him!”

He walked, looking about him angrily and distractedly."
"All his ideas now
seemed to be circling round some single point, and he felt that there
really was such a point, and that now, now, he was left facing that
point--and for the first time, indeed, during the last two months."
"“Damn it all!” he thought suddenly, in a fit of ungovernable fury."
"“If it has begun, then it has begun."
Hang the new life!
"Good Lord, how
stupid it is!..."
And what lies I told to-day!
"How despicably I fawned
upon that wretched Ilya Petrovitch!"
But that is all folly!
"What do I
care for them all, and my fawning upon them!"
It is not that at all!
"It
is not that at all!”

Suddenly he stopped; a new utterly unexpected and exceedingly simple
question perplexed and bitterly confounded him."
"“If it all has really been done deliberately and not idiotically, if
I really had a certain and definite object, how is it I did not even
glance into the purse and don’t know what I had there, for which I have
undergone these agonies, and have deliberately undertaken this base,
filthy degrading business?"
"And here I wanted at once to throw into the
water the purse together with all the things which I had not seen
either... how’s that?”

Yes, that was so, that was all so."
"Yet he had known it all before, and
it was not a new question for him, even when it was decided in the night
without hesitation and consideration, as though so it must be, as though
it could not possibly be otherwise...."
"Yes, he had known it all, and
understood it all; it surely had all been settled even yesterday at the
moment when he was bending over the box and pulling the jewel-cases out
of it...."
"Yes, so it was."
"“It is because I am very ill,” he decided grimly at last, “I have been
worrying and fretting myself, and I don’t know what I am doing...."
"Yesterday and the day before yesterday and all this time I have been
worrying myself...."
I shall get well and I shall not worry....
"But what
if I don’t get well at all?"
"Good God, how sick I am of it all!”

He walked on without resting."
"He had a terrible longing for some
distraction, but he did not know what to do, what to attempt."
"A new
overwhelming sensation was gaining more and more mastery over him
every moment; this was an immeasurable, almost physical, repulsion for
everything surrounding him, an obstinate, malignant feeling of hatred."
"All who met him were loathsome to him--he loathed their faces, their
movements, their gestures."
"If anyone had addressed him, he felt that he
might have spat at him or bitten him...."
"He stopped suddenly, on coming out on the bank of the Little Neva, near
the bridge to Vassilyevsky Ostrov."
"“Why, he lives here, in that house,”
 he thought, “why, I have not come to Razumihin of my own accord!"
"Here
it’s the same thing over again...."
"Very interesting to know, though;
have I come on purpose or have I simply walked here by chance?"
"Never
mind, I said the day before yesterday that I would go and see him the
day _after_; well, and so I will!"
"Besides I really cannot go further
now.”

He went up to Razumihin’s room on the fifth floor."
"The latter was at home in his garret, busily writing at the moment, and
he opened the door himself."
"It was four months since they had seen each
other."
"Razumihin was sitting in a ragged dressing-gown, with slippers on
his bare feet, unkempt, unshaven and unwashed."
His face showed surprise.
“Is it you?” he cried.
"He looked his comrade up and down; then after a
brief pause, he whistled."
“As hard up as all that!
"Why, brother, you’ve
cut me out!” he added, looking at Raskolnikov’s rags."
"“Come sit down,
you are tired, I’ll be bound.”

And when he had sunk down on the American leather sofa, which was
in even worse condition than his own, Razumihin saw at once that his
visitor was ill.

“Why, you are seriously ill, do you know that?” He began feeling his
pulse."
Raskolnikov pulled away his hand.
"“Never mind,” he said, “I have come for this: I have no lessons...."
"I
wanted,... but I don’t really want lessons....”

“But I say!"
"You are delirious, you know!” Razumihin observed, watching
him carefully."
"“No, I am not.”

Raskolnikov got up from the sofa."
"As he had mounted the stairs to
Razumihin’s, he had not realised that he would be meeting his friend
face to face."
"Now, in a flash, he knew, that what he was least of all
disposed for at that moment was to be face to face with anyone in the
wide world."
His spleen rose within him.
"He almost choked with rage at
himself as soon as he crossed Razumihin’s threshold."
"“Good-bye,” he said abruptly, and walked to the door."
"“Stop, stop!"
"You queer fish.”

“I don’t want to,” said the other, again pulling away his hand."
“Then why the devil have you come?
"Are you mad, or what?"
"Why, this
is... almost insulting!"
"I won’t let you go like that.”

“Well, then, I came to you because I know no one but you who could
help... to begin... because you are kinder than anyone--cleverer, I
mean, and can judge... and now I see that I want nothing."
Do you hear?
Nothing at all... no one’s services... no one’s sympathy.
"I am by
myself... alone."
"Come, that’s enough."
"Leave me alone.”

“Stay a minute, you sweep!"
You are a perfect madman.
"As you like for all
I care."
"I have no lessons, do you see, and I don’t care about that, but
there’s a bookseller, Heruvimov--and he takes the place of a lesson."
I would not exchange him for five lessons.
"He’s doing publishing of a
kind, and issuing natural science manuals and what a circulation they
have!"
The very titles are worth the money!
"You always maintained that I
was a fool, but by Jove, my boy, there are greater fools than I am!"
"Now he is setting up for being advanced, not that he has an inkling of
anything, but, of course, I encourage him."
"Here are two signatures of
the German text--in my opinion, the crudest charlatanism; it discusses
the question, ‘Is woman a human being?’ And, of course, triumphantly
proves that she is."
"Heruvimov is going to bring out this work as a
contribution to the woman question; I am translating it; he will expand
these two and a half signatures into six, we shall make up a gorgeous
title half a page long and bring it out at half a rouble."
It will do!
"He
pays me six roubles the signature, it works out to about fifteen roubles
for the job, and I’ve had six already in advance."
"When we have finished
this, we are going to begin a translation about whales, and then some of
the dullest scandals out of the second part of _Les Confessions_ we have
marked for translation; somebody has told Heruvimov, that Rousseau was
a kind of Radishchev."
"You may be sure I don’t contradict him, hang him!"
"Well, would you like to do the second signature of ‘_Is woman a human
being?_’ If you would, take the German and pens and paper--all those
are provided, and take three roubles; for as I have had six roubles in
advance on the whole thing, three roubles come to you for your share."
"And when you have finished the signature there will be another three
roubles for you."
"And please don’t think I am doing you a service; quite
the contrary, as soon as you came in, I saw how you could help me; to
begin with, I am weak in spelling, and secondly, I am sometimes utterly
adrift in German, so that I make it up as I go along for the most part."
"The only comfort is, that it’s bound to be a change for the better."
"Though who can tell, maybe it’s sometimes for the worse."
"Will you take
it?”

Raskolnikov took the German sheets in silence, took the three roubles
and without a word went out."
Razumihin gazed after him in astonishment.
"But when Raskolnikov was in the next street, he turned back, mounted the
stairs to Razumihin’s again and laying on the table the German article
and the three roubles, went out again, still without uttering a word."
"“Are you raving, or what?” Razumihin shouted, roused to fury at last."
“What farce is this?
"You’ll drive me crazy too... what did you come to
see me for, damn you?”

“I don’t want... translation,” muttered Raskolnikov from the stairs."
“Then what the devil do you want?” shouted Razumihin from above.
Raskolnikov continued descending the staircase in silence.
"“Hey, there!"
"Where are you living?”

No answer."
"“Well, confound you then!”

But Raskolnikov was already stepping into the street."
"On the Nikolaevsky
Bridge he was roused to full consciousness again by an unpleasant
incident."
"A coachman, after shouting at him two or three times, gave him
a violent lash on the back with his whip, for having almost fallen under
his horses’ hoofs."
"The lash so infuriated him that he dashed away to the
railing (for some unknown reason he had been walking in the very middle
of the bridge in the traffic)."
He angrily clenched and ground his teeth.
"He heard laughter, of course."
"“Serves him right!”

“A pickpocket I dare say.”

“Pretending to be drunk, for sure, and getting under the wheels on
purpose; and you have to answer for him.”

“It’s a regular profession, that’s what it is.”

But while he stood at the railing, still looking angry and bewildered
after the retreating carriage, and rubbing his back, he suddenly felt
someone thrust money into his hand."
He looked.
"It was an elderly woman
in a kerchief and goatskin shoes, with a girl, probably her daughter,
wearing a hat, and carrying a green parasol."
"“Take it, my good man, in Christ’s name.”

He took it and they passed on."
It was a piece of twenty copecks.
"From
his dress and appearance they might well have taken him for a beggar
asking alms in the streets, and the gift of the twenty copecks he
doubtless owed to the blow, which made them feel sorry for him."
"He closed his hand on the twenty copecks, walked on for ten paces, and
turned facing the Neva, looking towards the palace."
"The sky was without
a cloud and the water was almost bright blue, which is so rare in the
Neva."
"The cupola of the cathedral, which is seen at its best from the
bridge about twenty paces from the chapel, glittered in the sunlight,
and in the pure air every ornament on it could be clearly distinguished."
"The pain from the lash went off, and Raskolnikov forgot about it; one
uneasy and not quite definite idea occupied him now completely."
"He stood
still, and gazed long and intently into the distance; this spot was
especially familiar to him."
"When he was attending the university, he had
hundreds of times--generally on his way home--stood still on this spot,
gazed at this truly magnificent spectacle and almost always marvelled at
a vague and mysterious emotion it roused in him."
"It left him strangely
cold; this gorgeous picture was for him blank and lifeless."
"He wondered
every time at his sombre and enigmatic impression and, mistrusting
himself, put off finding the explanation of it."
"He vividly recalled
those old doubts and perplexities, and it seemed to him that it was
no mere chance that he recalled them now."
"It struck him as strange and
grotesque, that he should have stopped at the same spot as before,
as though he actually imagined he could think the same thoughts, be
interested in the same theories and pictures that had interested him...
so short a time ago."
"He felt it almost amusing, and yet it wrung his
heart."
"Deep down, hidden far away out of sight all that seemed to him
now--all his old past, his old thoughts, his old problems and theories,
his old impressions and that picture and himself and all, all...."
"He
felt as though he were flying upwards, and everything were vanishing
from his sight."
"Making an unconscious movement with his hand, he
suddenly became aware of the piece of money in his fist."
"He opened his
hand, stared at the coin, and with a sweep of his arm flung it into
the water; then he turned and went home."
"It seemed to him, he had cut
himself off from everyone and from everything at that moment."
"Evening was coming on when he reached home, so that he must have been
walking about six hours."
How and where he came back he did not remember.
"Undressing, and quivering like an overdriven horse, he lay down on the
sofa, drew his greatcoat over him, and at once sank into oblivion...."
It was dusk when he was waked up by a fearful scream.
"Good God, what a
scream!"
"Such unnatural sounds, such howling, wailing, grinding, tears,
blows and curses he had never heard."
"He could never have imagined such brutality, such frenzy."
"In terror he
sat up in bed, almost swooning with agony."
"But the fighting, wailing
and cursing grew louder and louder."
"And then to his intense amazement
he caught the voice of his landlady."
"She was howling, shrieking and
wailing, rapidly, hurriedly, incoherently, so that he could not make
out what she was talking about; she was beseeching, no doubt, not to be
beaten, for she was being mercilessly beaten on the stairs."
"The voice of
her assailant was so horrible from spite and rage that it was almost
a croak; but he, too, was saying something, and just as quickly
and indistinctly, hurrying and spluttering."
"All at once Raskolnikov
trembled; he recognised the voice--it was the voice of Ilya Petrovitch."
Ilya Petrovitch here and beating the landlady!
"He is kicking her,
banging her head against the steps--that’s clear, that can be told
from the sounds, from the cries and the thuds."
"How is it, is the world
topsy-turvy?"
"He could hear people running in crowds from all the storeys
and all the staircases; he heard voices, exclamations, knocking, doors
banging."
"“But why, why, and how could it be?” he repeated, thinking
seriously that he had gone mad."
"But no, he heard too distinctly!"
"And
they would come to him then next, “for no doubt... it’s all about
that... about yesterday.... Good God!” He would have fastened his door
with the latch, but he could not lift his hand... besides, it would
be useless."
"Terror gripped his heart like ice, tortured him and numbed
him...."
"But at last all this uproar, after continuing about ten minutes,
began gradually to subside."
"The landlady was moaning and groaning; Ilya
Petrovitch was still uttering threats and curses...."
"But at last he,
too, seemed to be silent, and now he could not be heard."
"“Can he have
gone away?"
"Good Lord!” Yes, and now the landlady is going too, still
weeping and moaning... and then her door slammed.... Now the crowd was
going from the stairs to their rooms, exclaiming, disputing, calling
to one another, raising their voices to a shout, dropping them to a
whisper."
"There must have been numbers of them--almost all the inmates
of the block."
"“But, good God, how could it be!"
"And why, why had he come
here!”

Raskolnikov sank worn out on the sofa, but could not close his eyes."
"He
lay for half an hour in such anguish, such an intolerable sensation of
infinite terror as he had never experienced before."
"Suddenly a bright
light flashed into his room."
"Nastasya came in with a candle and a plate
of soup."
"Looking at him carefully and ascertaining that he was not
asleep, she set the candle on the table and began to lay out what she
had brought--bread, salt, a plate, a spoon."
"“You’ve eaten nothing since yesterday, I warrant."
"You’ve been trudging
about all day, and you’re shaking with fever.”

“Nastasya... what were they beating the landlady for?”

She looked intently at him."
"“Who beat the landlady?”

“Just now... half an hour ago, Ilya Petrovitch, the assistant
superintendent, on the stairs.... Why was he ill-treating her like that,
and... why was he here?”

Nastasya scrutinised him, silent and frowning, and her scrutiny lasted a
long time."
"He felt uneasy, even frightened at her searching eyes."
"“Nastasya, why don’t you speak?” he said timidly at last in a weak
voice."
"“It’s the blood,” she answered at last softly, as though speaking to
herself."
“Blood?
"What blood?” he muttered, growing white and turning towards the
wall."
Nastasya still looked at him without speaking.
"“Nobody has been beating the landlady,” she declared at last in a firm,
resolute voice."
"He gazed at her, hardly able to breathe."
“I heard it myself....
I was not asleep...
"I was sitting up,” he
said still more timidly."
“I listened a long while.
"The assistant
superintendent came.... Everyone ran out on to the stairs from all the
flats.”

“No one has been here."
That’s the blood crying in your ears.
"When
there’s no outlet for it and it gets clotted, you begin fancying
things.... Will you eat something?”

He made no answer."
"Nastasya still stood over him, watching him."
"“Give me something to drink... Nastasya.”

She went downstairs and returned with a white earthenware jug of water."
"He remembered only swallowing one sip of the cold water and spilling
some on his neck."
Then followed forgetfulness.
"CHAPTER III

He was not completely unconscious, however, all the time he was ill; he
was in a feverish state, sometimes delirious, sometimes half conscious."
He remembered a great deal afterwards.
"Sometimes it seemed as though
there were a number of people round him; they wanted to take him away
somewhere, there was a great deal of squabbling and discussing about
him."
"Then he would be alone in the room; they had all gone away afraid
of him, and only now and then opened the door a crack to look at him;
they threatened him, plotted something together, laughed, and mocked
at him."
"He remembered Nastasya often at his bedside; he distinguished
another person, too, whom he seemed to know very well, though he could
not remember who he was, and this fretted him, even made him cry."
"Sometimes he fancied he had been lying there a month; at other times
it all seemed part of the same day."
"But of _that_--of _that_ he had
no recollection, and yet every minute he felt that he had forgotten
something he ought to remember."
"He worried and tormented himself trying
to remember, moaned, flew into a rage, or sank into awful, intolerable
terror."
"Then he struggled to get up, would have run away, but someone
always prevented him by force, and he sank back into impotence and
forgetfulness."
At last he returned to complete consciousness.
It happened at ten o’clock in the morning.
"On fine days the sun shone
into the room at that hour, throwing a streak of light on the right
wall and the corner near the door."
"Nastasya was standing beside him
with another person, a complete stranger, who was looking at him
very inquisitively."
"He was a young man with a beard, wearing a full,
short-waisted coat, and looked like a messenger."
"The landlady was
peeping in at the half-opened door."
Raskolnikov sat up.
"“Who is this, Nastasya?” he asked, pointing to the young man."
"“I say, he’s himself again!” she said."
"“He is himself,” echoed the man."
"Concluding that he had returned to his senses, the landlady closed the
door and disappeared."
"She was always shy and dreaded conversations or
discussions."
"She was a woman of forty, not at all bad-looking, fat
and buxom, with black eyes and eyebrows, good-natured from fatness and
laziness, and absurdly bashful."
"“Who... are you?” he went on, addressing the man."
"But at that moment
the door was flung open, and, stooping a little, as he was so tall,
Razumihin came in."
“What a cabin it is!” he cried.
“I am always knocking my head.
"You call
this a lodging!"
"So you are conscious, brother?"
"I’ve just heard the news
from Pashenka.”

“He has just come to,” said Nastasya."
"“Just come to,” echoed the man again, with a smile."
"“And who are you?” Razumihin asked, suddenly addressing him."
"“My name is
Vrazumihin, at your service; not Razumihin, as I am always called, but
Vrazumihin, a student and gentleman; and he is my friend."
"And who are
you?”

“I am the messenger from our office, from the merchant Shelopaev, and
I’ve come on business.”

“Please sit down.” Razumihin seated himself on the other side of the
table."
"“It’s a good thing you’ve come to, brother,” he went on to
Raskolnikov."
"“For the last four days you have scarcely eaten or drunk
anything."
We had to give you tea in spoonfuls.
"I brought Zossimov to see
you twice."
You remember Zossimov?
"He examined you carefully and said at
once it was nothing serious--something seemed to have gone to your head."
"Some nervous nonsense, the result of bad feeding, he says you have not
had enough beer and radish, but it’s nothing much, it will pass and you
will be all right."
Zossimov is a first-rate fellow!
"He is making quite a
name."
"Come, I won’t keep you,” he said, addressing the man again."
"“Will
you explain what you want?"
"You must know, Rodya, this is the second time
they have sent from the office; but it was another man last time, and I
talked to him."
"Who was it came before?”

“That was the day before yesterday, I venture to say, if you please,
sir."
"That was Alexey Semyonovitch; he is in our office, too.”

“He was more intelligent than you, don’t you think so?”

“Yes, indeed, sir, he is of more weight than I am.”

“Quite so; go on.”

“At your mamma’s request, through Afanasy Ivanovitch Vahrushin, of whom
I presume you have heard more than once, a remittance is sent to you
from our office,” the man began, addressing Raskolnikov."
"“If you are in
an intelligible condition, I’ve thirty-five roubles to remit to you, as
Semyon Semyonovitch has received from Afanasy Ivanovitch at your mamma’s
request instructions to that effect, as on previous occasions."
"Do you
know him, sir?”

“Yes, I remember... Vahrushin,” Raskolnikov said dreamily."
"“You hear, he knows Vahrushin,” cried Razumihin."
"“He is in ‘an
intelligible condition’!"
And I see you are an intelligent man too.
"Well,
it’s always pleasant to hear words of wisdom.”

“That’s the gentleman, Vahrushin, Afanasy Ivanovitch."
"And at the request
of your mamma, who has sent you a remittance once before in the
same manner through him, he did not refuse this time also, and sent
instructions to Semyon Semyonovitch some days since to hand you
thirty-five roubles in the hope of better to come.”

“That ‘hoping for better to come’ is the best thing you’ve said, though
‘your mamma’ is not bad either."
"Come then, what do you say?"
"Is he fully
conscious, eh?”

“That’s all right."
"If only he can sign this little paper.”

“He can scrawl his name."
"Have you got the book?”

“Yes, here’s the book.”

“Give it to me."
"Here, Rodya, sit up."
I’ll hold you.
"Take the pen and
scribble ‘Raskolnikov’ for him."
"For just now, brother, money is sweeter
to us than treacle.”

“I don’t want it,” said Raskolnikov, pushing away the pen."
"“Not want it?”

“I won’t sign it.”

“How the devil can you do without signing it?”

“I don’t want... the money.”

“Don’t want the money!"
"Come, brother, that’s nonsense, I bear witness."
"Don’t trouble, please, it’s only that he is on his travels again."
"But
that’s pretty common with him at all times though.... You are a man of
judgment and we will take him in hand, that is, more simply, take his
hand and he will sign it."
"Here.”

“But I can come another time.”

“No, no."
Why should we trouble you?
"You are a man of judgment.... Now,
Rodya, don’t keep your visitor, you see he is waiting,” and he made
ready to hold Raskolnikov’s hand in earnest."
"“Stop, I’ll do it alone,” said the latter, taking the pen and signing
his name."
The messenger took out the money and went away.
“Bravo!
"And now, brother, are you hungry?”

“Yes,” answered Raskolnikov."
"“Is there any soup?”

“Some of yesterday’s,” answered Nastasya, who was still standing there."
"“With potatoes and rice in it?”

“Yes.”

“I know it by heart."
"Bring soup and give us some tea.”

“Very well.”

Raskolnikov looked at all this with profound astonishment and a dull,
unreasoning terror."
"He made up his mind to keep quiet and see what
would happen."
“I believe I am not wandering.
"I believe it’s reality,” he
thought."
"In a couple of minutes Nastasya returned with the soup, and announced
that the tea would be ready directly."
"With the soup she brought two
spoons, two plates, salt, pepper, mustard for the beef, and so on."
"The
table was set as it had not been for a long time."
The cloth was clean.
"“It would not be amiss, Nastasya, if Praskovya Pavlovna were to send us
up a couple of bottles of beer."
"We could empty them.”

“Well, you are a cool hand,” muttered Nastasya, and she departed to
carry out his orders."
Raskolnikov still gazed wildly with strained attention.
"Meanwhile
Razumihin sat down on the sofa beside him, as clumsily as a bear put his
left arm round Raskolnikov’s head, although he was able to sit up, and
with his right hand gave him a spoonful of soup, blowing on it that
it might not burn him."
But the soup was only just warm.
"Raskolnikov
swallowed one spoonful greedily, then a second, then a third."
"But after
giving him a few more spoonfuls of soup, Razumihin suddenly stopped, and
said that he must ask Zossimov whether he ought to have more."
Nastasya came in with two bottles of beer.
"“And will you have tea?”

“Yes.”

“Cut along, Nastasya, and bring some tea, for tea we may venture on
without the faculty."
"But here is the beer!” He moved back to his chair,
pulled the soup and meat in front of him, and began eating as though he
had not touched food for three days."
"“I must tell you, Rodya, I dine like this here every day now,” he
mumbled with his mouth full of beef, “and it’s all Pashenka, your dear
little landlady, who sees to that; she loves to do anything for me."
"I
don’t ask for it, but, of course, I don’t object."
"And here’s Nastasya
with the tea."
She is a quick girl.
"Nastasya, my dear, won’t you have
some beer?”

“Get along with your nonsense!”

“A cup of tea, then?”

“A cup of tea, maybe.”

“Pour it out."
"Stay, I’ll pour it out myself."
"Sit down.”

He poured out two cups, left his dinner, and sat on the sofa again."
"As
before, he put his left arm round the sick man’s head, raised him up
and gave him tea in spoonfuls, again blowing each spoonful steadily and
earnestly, as though this process was the principal and most effective
means towards his friend’s recovery."
"Raskolnikov said nothing and made
no resistance, though he felt quite strong enough to sit up on the sofa
without support and could not merely have held a cup or a spoon, but
even perhaps could have walked about."
"But from some queer, almost
animal, cunning he conceived the idea of hiding his strength and lying
low for a time, pretending if necessary not to be yet in full possession
of his faculties, and meanwhile listening to find out what was going on."
Yet he could not overcome his sense of repugnance.
"After sipping a dozen
spoonfuls of tea, he suddenly released his head, pushed the spoon away
capriciously, and sank back on the pillow."
"There were actually real
pillows under his head now, down pillows in clean cases, he observed
that, too, and took note of it."
"“Pashenka must give us some raspberry jam to-day to make him some
raspberry tea,” said Razumihin, going back to his chair and attacking
his soup and beer again."
"“And where is she to get raspberries for you?” asked Nastasya, balancing
a saucer on her five outspread fingers and sipping tea through a lump of
sugar."
"“She’ll get it at the shop, my dear."
"You see, Rodya, all sorts of things
have been happening while you have been laid up."
"When you decamped in
that rascally way without leaving your address, I felt so angry that I
resolved to find you out and punish you."
I set to work that very day.
How I ran about making inquiries for you!
"This lodging of yours I had
forgotten, though I never remembered it, indeed, because I did not know
it; and as for your old lodgings, I could only remember it was at the
Five Corners, Harlamov’s house."
"I kept trying to find that Harlamov’s
house, and afterwards it turned out that it was not Harlamov’s, but
Buch’s."
How one muddles up sound sometimes!
"So I lost my temper, and I
went on the chance to the address bureau next day, and only fancy, in
two minutes they looked you up!"
"Your name is down there.”

“My name!”

“I should think so; and yet a General Kobelev they could not find while
I was there."
"Well, it’s a long story."
"But as soon as I did land on this
place, I soon got to know all your affairs--all, all, brother, I know
everything; Nastasya here will tell you."
"I made the acquaintance of
Nikodim Fomitch and Ilya Petrovitch, and the house-porter and Mr.
Zametov, Alexandr Grigorievitch, the head clerk in the police office,
and, last, but not least, of Pashenka; Nastasya here knows....”

“He’s got round her,” Nastasya murmured, smiling slyly."
"“Why don’t you put the sugar in your tea, Nastasya Nikiforovna?”

“You are a one!” Nastasya cried suddenly, going off into a giggle."
"“I am
not Nikiforovna, but Petrovna,” she added suddenly, recovering from her
mirth."
“I’ll make a note of it.
"Well, brother, to make a long story short,
I was going in for a regular explosion here to uproot all malignant
influences in the locality, but Pashenka won the day."
"I had not
expected, brother, to find her so... prepossessing."
"Eh, what do you
think?”

Raskolnikov did not speak, but he still kept his eyes fixed upon him,
full of alarm."
"“And all that could be wished, indeed, in every respect,” Razumihin went
on, not at all embarrassed by his silence."
"“Ah, the sly dog!” Nastasya shrieked again."
"This conversation afforded
her unspeakable delight."
"“It’s a pity, brother, that you did not set to work in the right way
at first."
You ought to have approached her differently.
"She is, so
to speak, a most unaccountable character."
"But we will talk about her
character later.... How could you let things come to such a pass that
she gave up sending you your dinner?"
And that I O U?
"You must have been
mad to sign an I O U."
"And that promise of marriage when her daughter,
Natalya Yegorovna, was alive?..."
I know all about it!
"But I see that’s
a delicate matter and I am an ass; forgive me."
"But, talking of
foolishness, do you know Praskovya Pavlovna is not nearly so foolish as
you would think at first sight?”

“No,” mumbled Raskolnikov, looking away, but feeling that it was better
to keep up the conversation."
"“She isn’t, is she?” cried Razumihin, delighted to get an answer out
of him."
"“But she is not very clever either, eh?"
"She is essentially,
essentially an unaccountable character!"
"I am sometimes quite at a loss,
I assure you.... She must be forty; she says she is thirty-six, and
of course she has every right to say so."
"But I swear I judge her
intellectually, simply from the metaphysical point of view; there is a
sort of symbolism sprung up between us, a sort of algebra or what not!"
I don’t understand it!
"Well, that’s all nonsense."
"Only, seeing that you
are not a student now and have lost your lessons and your clothes, and
that through the young lady’s death she has no need to treat you as
a relation, she suddenly took fright; and as you hid in your den and
dropped all your old relations with her, she planned to get rid of you."
"And she’s been cherishing that design a long time, but was sorry to lose
the I O U, for you assured her yourself that your mother would pay.”

“It was base of me to say that.... My mother herself is almost
a beggar... and I told a lie to keep my lodging... and be fed,”
 Raskolnikov said loudly and distinctly."
"“Yes, you did very sensibly."
"But the worst of it is that at that point
Mr. Tchebarov turns up, a business man."
"Pashenka would never have
thought of doing anything on her own account, she is too retiring; but
the business man is by no means retiring, and first thing he puts the
question, ‘Is there any hope of realising the I O U?’ Answer: there is,
because he has a mother who would save her Rodya with her hundred and
twenty-five roubles pension, if she has to starve herself; and a sister,
too, who would go into bondage for his sake."
"That’s what he was building
upon.... Why do you start?"
"I know all the ins and outs of your affairs
now, my dear boy--it’s not for nothing that you were so open with
Pashenka when you were her prospective son-in-law, and I say all this as
a friend...."
"But I tell you what it is; an honest and sensitive man is
open; and a business man ‘listens and goes on eating’ you up."
"Well,
then she gave the I O U by way of payment to this Tchebarov, and without
hesitation he made a formal demand for payment."
"When I heard of all this
I wanted to blow him up, too, to clear my conscience, but by that time
harmony reigned between me and Pashenka, and I insisted on stopping
the whole affair, engaging that you would pay."
"I went security for you,
brother."
Do you understand?
"We called Tchebarov, flung him ten
roubles and got the I O U back from him, and here I have the honour of
presenting it to you."
She trusts your word now.
"Here, take it, you see I
have torn it.”

Razumihin put the note on the table."
"Raskolnikov looked at him and
turned to the wall without uttering a word."
"Even Razumihin felt a
twinge."
"“I see, brother,” he said a moment later, “that I have been playing the
fool again."
"I thought I should amuse you with my chatter, and I believe
I have only made you cross.”

“Was it you I did not recognise when I was delirious?” Raskolnikov
asked, after a moment’s pause without turning his head."
"“Yes, and you flew into a rage about it, especially when I brought
Zametov one day.”

“Zametov?"
The head clerk?
"What for?” Raskolnikov turned round quickly
and fixed his eyes on Razumihin."
“What’s the matter with you?...
What are you upset about?
"He wanted to
make your acquaintance because I talked to him a lot about you.... How
could I have found out so much except from him?"
"He is a capital
fellow, brother, first-rate... in his own way, of course."
"Now we are
friends--see each other almost every day."
"I have moved into this part,
you know."
I have only just moved.
"I’ve been with him to Luise Ivanovna
once or twice.... Do you remember Luise, Luise Ivanovna?"
"“Did I say anything in delirium?”

“I should think so!"
"You were beside yourself.”

“What did I rave about?”

“What next?"
What did you rave about?
"What people do rave about.... Well,
brother, now I must not lose time."
"To work.” He got up from the table
and took up his cap."
"“What did I rave about?”

“How he keeps on!"
Are you afraid of having let out some secret?
"Don’t
worry yourself; you said nothing about a countess."
"But you said a lot
about a bulldog, and about ear-rings and chains, and about Krestovsky
Island, and some porter, and Nikodim Fomitch and Ilya Petrovitch, the
assistant superintendent."
"And another thing that was of special interest
to you was your own sock."
"You whined, ‘Give me my sock.’ Zametov
hunted all about your room for your socks, and with his own scented,
ring-bedecked fingers he gave you the rag."
"And only then were you
comforted, and for the next twenty-four hours you held the wretched
thing in your hand; we could not get it from you."
"It is most likely
somewhere under your quilt at this moment."
"And then you asked so
piteously for fringe for your trousers."
"We tried to find out what sort
of fringe, but we could not make it out."
Now to business!
"Here are
thirty-five roubles; I take ten of them, and shall give you an account
of them in an hour or two."
"I will let Zossimov know at the same time,
though he ought to have been here long ago, for it is nearly twelve."
"And
you, Nastasya, look in pretty often while I am away, to see whether he
wants a drink or anything else."
"And I will tell Pashenka what is wanted
myself."
"Good-bye!”

“He calls her Pashenka!"
"Ah, he’s a deep one!” said Nastasya as he went
out; then she opened the door and stood listening, but could not resist
running downstairs after him."
"She was very eager to hear what he would
say to the landlady."
She was evidently quite fascinated by Razumihin.
"No sooner had she left the room than the sick man flung off the
bedclothes and leapt out of bed like a madman."
"With burning, twitching
impatience he had waited for them to be gone so that he might set to
work."
But to what work?
"Now, as though to spite him, it eluded him."
"“Good God, only tell me one thing: do they know of it yet or not?"
"What
if they know it and are only pretending, mocking me while I am laid up,
and then they will come in and tell me that it’s been discovered long
ago and that they have only... What am I to do now?"
"That’s what I’ve
forgotten, as though on purpose; forgotten it all at once, I remembered
a minute ago.”

He stood in the middle of the room and gazed in miserable bewilderment
about him; he walked to the door, opened it, listened; but that was not
what he wanted."
"Suddenly, as though recalling something, he rushed to
the corner where there was a hole under the paper, began examining it,
put his hand into the hole, fumbled--but that was not it."
"He went to the
stove, opened it and began rummaging in the ashes; the frayed edges of
his trousers and the rags cut off his pocket were lying there just as
he had thrown them."
"No one had looked, then!"
"Then he remembered the sock
about which Razumihin had just been telling him."
"Yes, there it lay on
the sofa under the quilt, but it was so covered with dust and grime that
Zametov could not have seen anything on it."
"“Bah, Zametov!"
The police office!
"And why am I sent for to the police
office?"
Where’s the notice?
Bah!
I am mixing it up; that was then.
"I
looked at my sock then, too, but now... now I have been ill."
"But
what did Zametov come for?"
"Why did Razumihin bring him?” he muttered,
helplessly sitting on the sofa again."
“What does it mean?
"Am I still in
delirium, or is it real?"
"I believe it is real.... Ah, I remember; I must
escape!"
Make haste to escape.
"Yes, I must, I must escape!"
"Yes... but
where?"
And where are my clothes?
I’ve no boots.
They’ve taken them away!
They’ve hidden them!
I understand!
"Ah, here is my coat--they passed that
over!"
"And here is money on the table, thank God!"
"And here’s the I O U...
I’ll take the money and go and take another lodging."
"They won’t find
me!..."
"Yes, but the address bureau?"
"They’ll find me, Razumihin will find
me."
"Better escape altogether... far away... to America, and let them
do their worst!"
"And take the I O U... it would be of use there.... What
else shall I take?"
They think I am ill!
"They don’t know that I can walk,
ha-ha-ha!"
I could see by their eyes that they know all about it!
"If
only I could get downstairs!"
"And what if they have set a watch
there--policemen!"
What’s this tea?
"Ah, and here is beer left, half a
bottle, cold!”

He snatched up the bottle, which still contained a glassful of beer, and
gulped it down with relish, as though quenching a flame in his breast."
"But in another minute the beer had gone to his head, and a faint and
even pleasant shiver ran down his spine."
"He lay down and pulled the
quilt over him."
"His sick and incoherent thoughts grew more and more
disconnected, and soon a light, pleasant drowsiness came upon him."
"With
a sense of comfort he nestled his head into the pillow, wrapped more
closely about him the soft, wadded quilt which had replaced the old,
ragged greatcoat, sighed softly and sank into a deep, sound, refreshing
sleep."
"He woke up, hearing someone come in."
"He opened his eyes and saw
Razumihin standing in the doorway, uncertain whether to come in or
not."
"Raskolnikov sat up quickly on the sofa and gazed at him, as though
trying to recall something."
"“Ah, you are not asleep!"
Here I am!
"Nastasya, bring in the parcel!”
 Razumihin shouted down the stairs."
"“You shall have the account
directly.”

“What time is it?” asked Raskolnikov, looking round uneasily."
"“Yes, you had a fine sleep, brother, it’s almost evening, it will be six
o’clock directly."
"You have slept more than six hours.”

“Good heavens!"
"Have I?”

“And why not?"
It will do you good.
What’s the hurry?
"A tryst, is it?"
We’ve all time before us.
"I’ve been waiting for the last three hours for
you; I’ve been up twice and found you asleep."
"I’ve called on Zossimov
twice; not at home, only fancy!"
"But no matter, he will turn up."
"And
I’ve been out on my own business, too."
"You know I’ve been moving to-day,
moving with my uncle."
I have an uncle living with me now.
"But that’s
no matter, to business."
"Give me the parcel, Nastasya."
"We will open it
directly."
"And how do you feel now, brother?”

“I am quite well, I am not ill. Razumihin, have you been here long?”

“I tell you I’ve been waiting for the last three hours.”

“No, before.”

“How do you mean?”

“How long have you been coming here?”

“Why I told you all about it this morning."
"Don’t you remember?”

Raskolnikov pondered."
The morning seemed like a dream to him.
"He could
not remember alone, and looked inquiringly at Razumihin."
"“Hm!” said the latter, “he has forgotten."
"I fancied then that you were
not quite yourself."
"Now you are better for your sleep.... You really
look much better."
First-rate!
"Well, to business."
"Look here, my dear
boy.”

He began untying the bundle, which evidently interested him."
"“Believe me, brother, this is something specially near my heart."
"For we
must make a man of you."
Let’s begin from the top.
"Do you see this
cap?” he said, taking out of the bundle a fairly good though cheap and
ordinary cap."
"“Let me try it on.”

“Presently, afterwards,” said Raskolnikov, waving it off pettishly."
"“Come, Rodya, my boy, don’t oppose it, afterwards will be too late; and
I shan’t sleep all night, for I bought it by guess, without measure."
"Just right!” he cried triumphantly, fitting it on, “just your size!"
"A
proper head-covering is the first thing in dress and a recommendation in
its own way."
"Tolstyakov, a friend of mine, is always obliged to take off
his pudding basin when he goes into any public place where other
people wear their hats or caps."
"People think he does it from slavish
politeness, but it’s simply because he is ashamed of his bird’s nest;
he is such a boastful fellow!"
"Look, Nastasya, here are two specimens of
headgear: this Palmerston”--he took from the corner Raskolnikov’s old,
battered hat, which for some unknown reason, he called a Palmerston--“or
this jewel!"
"Guess the price, Rodya, what do you suppose I paid for it,
Nastasya!” he said, turning to her, seeing that Raskolnikov did not
speak."
"“Twenty copecks, no more, I dare say,” answered Nastasya."
"“Twenty copecks, silly!” he cried, offended."
"“Why, nowadays you would
cost more than that--eighty copecks!"
"And that only because it has been
worn."
"And it’s bought on condition that when’s it’s worn out, they will
give you another next year."
"Yes, on my word!"
"Well, now let us pass to
the United States of America, as they called them at school."
"I assure
you I am proud of these breeches,” and he exhibited to Raskolnikov a
pair of light, summer trousers of grey woollen material."
"“No holes, no
spots, and quite respectable, although a little worn; and a waistcoat
to match, quite in the fashion."
"And its being worn really is an
improvement, it’s softer, smoother.... You see, Rodya, to my thinking,
the great thing for getting on in the world is always to keep to the
seasons; if you don’t insist on having asparagus in January, you keep
your money in your purse; and it’s the same with this purchase."
"It’s
summer now, so I’ve been buying summer things--warmer materials will be
wanted for autumn, so you will have to throw these away in any case...
especially as they will be done for by then from their own lack of
coherence if not your higher standard of luxury."
"Come, price them!"
"What
do you say?"
Two roubles twenty-five copecks!
"And remember the condition:
if you wear these out, you will have another suit for nothing!"
"They only
do business on that system at Fedyaev’s; if you’ve bought a thing once,
you are satisfied for life, for you will never go there again of your
own free will."
Now for the boots.
What do you say?
"You see that they are
a bit worn, but they’ll last a couple of months, for it’s foreign work
and foreign leather; the secretary of the English Embassy sold them last
week--he had only worn them six days, but he was very short of cash."
Price--a rouble and a half.
"A bargain?”

“But perhaps they won’t fit,” observed Nastasya."
“Not fit?
"Just look!” and he pulled out of his pocket Raskolnikov’s
old, broken boot, stiffly coated with dry mud."
"“I did not go
empty-handed--they took the size from this monster."
We all did our best.
"And as to your linen, your landlady has seen to that."
"Here, to begin
with are three shirts, hempen but with a fashionable front.... Well
now then, eighty copecks the cap, two roubles twenty-five copecks the
suit--together three roubles five copecks--a rouble and a half for the
boots--for, you see, they are very good--and that makes four roubles
fifty-five copecks; five roubles for the underclothes--they were
bought in the lot--which makes exactly nine roubles fifty-five copecks."
Forty-five copecks change in coppers.
Will you take it?
"And so, Rodya,
you are set up with a complete new rig-out, for your overcoat will
serve, and even has a style of its own."
"That comes from getting one’s
clothes from Sharmer’s!"
"As for your socks and other things, I leave them
to you; we’ve twenty-five roubles left."
"And as for Pashenka and paying
for your lodging, don’t you worry."
"I tell you she’ll trust you for
anything."
"And now, brother, let me change your linen, for I daresay you
will throw off your illness with your shirt.”

“Let me be!"
I don’t want to!” Raskolnikov waved him off.
"He had listened
with disgust to Razumihin’s efforts to be playful about his purchases."
"“Come, brother, don’t tell me I’ve been trudging around for nothing,”
 Razumihin insisted."
"“Nastasya, don’t be bashful, but help me--that’s
it,” and in spite of Raskolnikov’s resistance he changed his linen."
"The
latter sank back on the pillows and for a minute or two said nothing."
"“It will be long before I get rid of them,” he thought."
"“What money was
all that bought with?” he asked at last, gazing at the wall."
“Money?
"Why, your own, what the messenger brought from Vahrushin, your
mother sent it."
"Have you forgotten that, too?”

“I remember now,” said Raskolnikov after a long, sullen silence."
"Razumihin looked at him, frowning and uneasy."
"The door opened and a tall, stout man whose appearance seemed familiar
to Raskolnikov came in."
"CHAPTER IV

Zossimov was a tall, fat man with a puffy, colourless, clean-shaven face
and straight flaxen hair."
"He wore spectacles, and a big gold ring on
his fat finger."
He was twenty-seven.
"He had on a light grey fashionable
loose coat, light summer trousers, and everything about him loose,
fashionable and spick and span; his linen was irreproachable, his
watch-chain was massive."
"In manner he was slow and, as it were,
nonchalant, and at the same time studiously free and easy; he made
efforts to conceal his self-importance, but it was apparent at every
instant."
"All his acquaintances found him tedious, but said he was clever
at his work."
"“I’ve been to you twice to-day, brother."
"You see, he’s come to himself,”
 cried Razumihin."
"“I see, I see; and how do we feel now, eh?” said Zossimov to
Raskolnikov, watching him carefully and, sitting down at the foot of the
sofa, he settled himself as comfortably as he could."
"“He is still depressed,” Razumihin went on."
"“We’ve just changed his
linen and he almost cried.”

“That’s very natural; you might have put it off if he did not wish
it.... His pulse is first-rate."
"Is your head still aching, eh?”

“I am well, I am perfectly well!” Raskolnikov declared positively
and irritably."
"He raised himself on the sofa and looked at them with
glittering eyes, but sank back on to the pillow at once and turned to
the wall."
Zossimov watched him intently.
“Very good....
"Going on all right,” he said lazily."
"“Has he eaten
anything?”

They told him, and asked what he might have."
"“He may have anything... soup, tea... mushrooms and cucumbers, of
course, you must not give him; he’d better not have meat either, and...
but no need to tell you that!” Razumihin and he looked at each
other."
“No more medicine or anything.
I’ll look at him again to-morrow.
"Perhaps, to-day even... but never mind...”

“To-morrow evening I shall take him for a walk,” said Razumihin."
"“We are
going to the Yusupov garden and then to the Palais de Cristal.”

“I would not disturb him to-morrow at all, but I don’t know... a little,
maybe... but we’ll see.”

“Ach, what a nuisance!"
"I’ve got a house-warming party to-night; it’s
only a step from here."
Couldn’t he come?
He could lie on the sofa.
"You
are coming?” Razumihin said to Zossimov."
"“Don’t forget, you promised.”

“All right, only rather later."
"What are you going to do?”

“Oh, nothing--tea, vodka, herrings."
"There will be a pie... just our
friends.”

“And who?”

“All neighbours here, almost all new friends, except my old uncle, and
he is new too--he only arrived in Petersburg yesterday to see to some
business of his."
"We meet once in five years.”

“What is he?”

“He’s been stagnating all his life as a district postmaster; gets a
little pension."
He is sixty-five--not worth talking about....
"But I
am fond of him."
"Porfiry Petrovitch, the head of the Investigation
Department here..."
"But you know him.”

“Is he a relation of yours, too?”

“A very distant one."
But why are you scowling?
"Because you quarrelled
once, won’t you come then?”

“I don’t care a damn for him.”

“So much the better."
"Well, there will be some students, a teacher, a
government clerk, a musician, an officer and Zametov.”

“Do tell me, please, what you or he”--Zossimov nodded at
Raskolnikov--“can have in common with this Zametov?”

“Oh, you particular gentleman!"
Principles!
"You are worked by principles,
as it were by springs; you won’t venture to turn round on your own
account."
"If a man is a nice fellow, that’s the only principle I go upon."
"Zametov is a delightful person.”

“Though he does take bribes.”

“Well, he does!"
and what of it?
"I don’t care if he does take bribes,”
 Razumihin cried with unnatural irritability."
"“I don’t praise him for
taking bribes."
I only say he is a nice man in his own way!
"But if one
looks at men in all ways--are there many good ones left?"
"Why, I am sure
I shouldn’t be worth a baked onion myself... perhaps with you thrown
in.”

“That’s too little; I’d give two for you.”

“And I wouldn’t give more than one for you."
No more of your jokes!
Zametov is no more than a boy.
"I can pull his hair and one must draw him
not repel him."
"You’ll never improve a man by repelling him, especially
a boy."
One has to be twice as careful with a boy.
"Oh, you progressive
dullards!"
You don’t understand.
"You harm yourselves running another man
down...."
"But if you want to know, we really have something in common.”

“I should like to know what.”

“Why, it’s all about a house-painter.... We are getting him out of
a mess!"
Though indeed there’s nothing to fear now.
"The matter is
absolutely self-evident."
"We only put on steam.”

“A painter?”

“Why, haven’t I told you about it?"
"I only told you the beginning then
about the murder of the old pawnbroker-woman."
"Well, the painter is mixed
up in it...”

“Oh, I heard about that murder before and was rather interested in it...
partly... for one reason...."
"I read about it in the papers, too....”

“Lizaveta was murdered, too,” Nastasya blurted out, suddenly addressing
Raskolnikov."
"She remained in the room all the time, standing by the door
listening."
"“Lizaveta,” murmured Raskolnikov hardly audibly."
"“Lizaveta, who sold old clothes."
Didn’t you know her?
"She used to come
here."
"She mended a shirt for you, too.”

Raskolnikov turned to the wall where in the dirty, yellow paper he
picked out one clumsy, white flower with brown lines on it and began
examining how many petals there were in it, how many scallops in the
petals and how many lines on them."
"He felt his arms and legs as lifeless
as though they had been cut off."
"He did not attempt to move, but stared
obstinately at the flower."
"“But what about the painter?” Zossimov interrupted Nastasya’s chatter
with marked displeasure."
She sighed and was silent.
"“Why, he was accused of the murder,” Razumihin went on hotly."
"“Was there evidence against him then?”

“Evidence, indeed!"
"Evidence that was no evidence, and that’s what we
have to prove."
"It was just as they pitched on those fellows, Koch and
Pestryakov, at first."
Foo!
"how stupidly it’s all done, it makes one
sick, though it’s not one’s business!"
"Pestryakov may be coming
to-night.... By the way, Rodya, you’ve heard about the business already;
it happened before you were ill, the day before you fainted at the
police office while they were talking about it.”

Zossimov looked curiously at Raskolnikov."
He did not stir.
"“But I say, Razumihin, I wonder at you."
"What a busybody you are!”
 Zossimov observed."
"“Maybe I am, but we will get him off anyway,” shouted Razumihin,
bringing his fist down on the table."
"“What’s the most offensive is not
their lying--one can always forgive lying--lying is a delightful thing,
for it leads to truth--what is offensive is that they lie and worship
their own lying...."
"I respect Porfiry, but... What threw them out at
first?"
"The door was locked, and when they came back with the porter
it was open."
"So it followed that Koch and Pestryakov were the
murderers--that was their logic!”

“But don’t excite yourself; they simply detained them, they could not
help that.... And, by the way, I’ve met that man Koch."
"He used to buy
unredeemed pledges from the old woman?"
"Eh?”

“Yes, he is a swindler."
"He buys up bad debts, too."
"He makes a profession
of it."
But enough of him!
Do you know what makes me angry?
"It’s their
sickening rotten, petrified routine.... And this case might be the means
of introducing a new method."
"One can show from the psychological data
alone how to get on the track of the real man."
"‘We have facts,’ they
say."
"But facts are not everything--at least half the business lies in
how you interpret them!”

“Can you interpret them, then?”

“Anyway, one can’t hold one’s tongue when one has a feeling, a tangible
feeling, that one might be a help if only.... Eh!"
"Do you know the
details of the case?”

“I am waiting to hear about the painter.”

“Oh, yes!"
"Well, here’s the story."
"Early on the third day after the
murder, when they were still dandling Koch and Pestryakov--though they
accounted for every step they took and it was as plain as a pikestaff--an
unexpected fact turned up."
"A peasant called Dushkin, who keeps a
dram-shop facing the house, brought to the police office a jeweller’s
case containing some gold ear-rings, and told a long rigamarole."
"‘The
day before yesterday, just after eight o’clock’--mark the day and the
hour!--‘a journeyman house-painter, Nikolay, who had been in to see me
already that day, brought me this box of gold ear-rings and stones, and
asked me to give him two roubles for them."
"When I asked him where he got
them, he said that he picked them up in the street."
"I did not ask him
anything more.’ I am telling you Dushkin’s story."
"‘I gave him a note’--a
rouble that is--‘for I thought if he did not pawn it with me he would
with another."
"It would all come to the same thing--he’d spend it on
drink, so the thing had better be with me."
"The further you hide it
the quicker you will find it, and if anything turns up, if I hear any
rumours, I’ll take it to the police.’ Of course, that’s all taradiddle;
he lies like a horse, for I know this Dushkin, he is a pawnbroker and
a receiver of stolen goods, and he did not cheat Nikolay out of a
thirty-rouble trinket in order to give it to the police."
"He was simply
afraid."
"But no matter, to return to Dushkin’s story."
"‘I’ve known
this peasant, Nikolay Dementyev, from a child; he comes from the same
province and district of Zaraïsk, we are both Ryazan men."
"And though
Nikolay is not a drunkard, he drinks, and I knew he had a job in that
house, painting work with Dmitri, who comes from the same village, too."
"As soon as he got the rouble he changed it, had a couple of glasses,
took his change and went out."
But I did not see Dmitri with him then.
"And the next day I heard that someone had murdered Alyona Ivanovna and
her sister, Lizaveta Ivanovna, with an axe."
"I knew them, and I felt
suspicious about the ear-rings at once, for I knew the murdered woman
lent money on pledges."
"I went to the house, and began to make careful
inquiries without saying a word to anyone."
"First of all I asked, “Is
Nikolay here?” Dmitri told me that Nikolay had gone off on the spree; he
had come home at daybreak drunk, stayed in the house about ten minutes,
and went out again."
"Dmitri didn’t see him again and is finishing the
job alone."
"And their job is on the same staircase as the murder, on
the second floor."
"When I heard all that I did not say a word to
anyone’--that’s Dushkin’s tale--‘but I found out what I could about
the murder, and went home feeling as suspicious as ever."
"And at eight
o’clock this morning’--that was the third day, you understand--‘I saw
Nikolay coming in, not sober, though not to say very drunk--he could
understand what was said to him."
"He sat down on the bench and did not
speak."
"There was only one stranger in the bar and a man I knew asleep
on a bench and our two boys."
“Have you seen Dmitri?” said I.
"“No, I
haven’t,” said he."
"“And you’ve not been here either?” “Not since the day
before yesterday,” said he."
"“And where did you sleep last night?”
 “In Peski, with the Kolomensky men.” “And where did you get those
ear-rings?” I asked."
"“I found them in the street,” and the way he said
it was a bit queer; he did not look at me."
"“Did you hear what happened
that very evening, at that very hour, on that same staircase?” said I."
"“No,” said he, “I had not heard,” and all the while he was listening,
his eyes were staring out of his head and he turned as white as chalk."
"I
told him all about it and he took his hat and began getting up."
"I wanted
to keep him."
"“Wait a bit, Nikolay,” said I, “won’t you have a drink?”
 And I signed to the boy to hold the door, and I came out from behind the
bar; but he darted out and down the street to the turning at a run."
I have not seen him since.
"Then my doubts were at an end--it was his
doing, as clear as could be....’”

“I should think so,” said Zossimov."
“Wait!
Hear the end.
"Of course they sought high and low for Nikolay;
they detained Dushkin and searched his house; Dmitri, too, was arrested;
the Kolomensky men also were turned inside out."
"And the day before
yesterday they arrested Nikolay in a tavern at the end of the town."
"He
had gone there, taken the silver cross off his neck and asked for a dram
for it."
They gave it to him.
"A few minutes afterwards the woman went
to the cowshed, and through a crack in the wall she saw in the stable
adjoining he had made a noose of his sash from the beam, stood on a
block of wood, and was trying to put his neck in the noose."
"The woman
screeched her hardest; people ran in."
"‘So that’s what you are up to!’
‘Take me,’ he says, ‘to such-and-such a police officer; I’ll confess
everything.’ Well, they took him to that police station--that is
here--with a suitable escort."
"So they asked him this and that, how old
he is, ‘twenty-two,’ and so on."
"At the question, ‘When you were working
with Dmitri, didn’t you see anyone on the staircase at such-and-such a
time?’--answer: ‘To be sure folks may have gone up and down, but I did
not notice them.’ ‘And didn’t you hear anything, any noise, and so on?’
‘We heard nothing special.’ ‘And did you hear, Nikolay, that on the same
day Widow So-and-so and her sister were murdered and robbed?’ ‘I
never knew a thing about it."
"The first I heard of it was from Afanasy
Pavlovitch the day before yesterday.’ ‘And where did you find the
ear-rings?’ ‘I found them on the pavement.’ ‘Why didn’t you go to work
with Dmitri the other day?’ ‘Because I was drinking.’ ‘And where were
you drinking?’ ‘Oh, in such-and-such a place.’ ‘Why did you run away
from Dushkin’s?’ ‘Because I was awfully frightened.’ ‘What were
you frightened of?’ ‘That I should be accused.’ ‘How could you be
frightened, if you felt free from guilt?’ Now, Zossimov, you may not
believe me, that question was put literally in those words."
"I know it
for a fact, it was repeated to me exactly!"
"What do you say to that?”

“Well, anyway, there’s the evidence.”

“I am not talking of the evidence now, I am talking about that question,
of their own idea of themselves."
"Well, so they squeezed and squeezed
him and he confessed: ‘I did not find it in the street, but in the flat
where I was painting with Dmitri.’ ‘And how was that?’ ‘Why, Dmitri and
I were painting there all day, and we were just getting ready to go, and
Dmitri took a brush and painted my face, and he ran off and I after him."
"I ran after him, shouting my hardest, and at the bottom of the stairs I
ran right against the porter and some gentlemen--and how many gentlemen
were there I don’t remember."
"And the porter swore at me, and the other
porter swore, too, and the porter’s wife came out, and swore at us, too;
and a gentleman came into the entry with a lady, and he swore at us,
too, for Dmitri and I lay right across the way."
"I got hold of Dmitri’s
hair and knocked him down and began beating him."
"And Dmitri, too, caught
me by the hair and began beating me."
"But we did it all not for temper
but in a friendly way, for sport."
"And then Dmitri escaped and ran into
the street, and I ran after him; but I did not catch him, and went back
to the flat alone; I had to clear up my things."
"I began putting them
together, expecting Dmitri to come, and there in the passage, in the
corner by the door, I stepped on the box."
"I saw it lying there wrapped
up in paper."
"I took off the paper, saw some little hooks, undid them,
and in the box were the ear-rings....’”

“Behind the door?"
Lying behind the door?
"Behind the door?” Raskolnikov
cried suddenly, staring with a blank look of terror at Razumihin, and he
slowly sat up on the sofa, leaning on his hand."
“Yes... why?
What’s the matter?
"What’s wrong?” Razumihin, too, got up
from his seat."
"“Nothing,” Raskolnikov answered faintly, turning to the wall."
"All were
silent for a while."
"“He must have waked from a dream,” Razumihin said at last, looking
inquiringly at Zossimov."
The latter slightly shook his head.
"“Well, go on,” said Zossimov."
"“What next?”

“What next?"
"As soon as he saw the ear-rings, forgetting Dmitri and
everything, he took up his cap and ran to Dushkin and, as we know, got
a rouble from him."
"He told a lie saying he found them in the street, and
went off drinking."
"He keeps repeating his old story about the murder:
‘I know nothing of it, never heard of it till the day before yesterday.’
‘And why didn’t you come to the police till now?’ ‘I was frightened.’
‘And why did you try to hang yourself?’ ‘From anxiety.’ ‘What anxiety?’
‘That I should be accused of it.’ Well, that’s the whole story."
"And now
what do you suppose they deduced from that?”

“Why, there’s no supposing."
"There’s a clue, such as it is, a fact."
"You
wouldn’t have your painter set free?”

“Now they’ve simply taken him for the murderer."
"They haven’t a shadow of
doubt.”

“That’s nonsense."
You are excited.
But what about the ear-rings?
"You
must admit that, if on the very same day and hour ear-rings from the old
woman’s box have come into Nikolay’s hands, they must have come there
somehow."
"That’s a good deal in such a case.”

“How did they get there?"
How did they get there?” cried Razumihin.
"“How can you, a doctor, whose duty it is to study man and who has more
opportunity than anyone else for studying human nature--how can you fail
to see the character of the man in the whole story?"
"Don’t you see at
once that the answers he has given in the examination are the holy
truth?"
"They came into his hand precisely as he has told us--he stepped
on the box and picked it up.”

“The holy truth!"
"But didn’t he own himself that he told a lie at first?”

“Listen to me, listen attentively."
"The porter and Koch and Pestryakov
and the other porter and the wife of the first porter and the woman who
was sitting in the porter’s lodge and the man Kryukov, who had just got
out of a cab at that minute and went in at the entry with a lady on his
arm, that is eight or ten witnesses, agree that Nikolay had Dmitri on
the ground, was lying on him beating him, while Dmitri hung on to his
hair, beating him, too."
"They lay right across the way, blocking the
thoroughfare."
"They were sworn at on all sides while they ‘like children’
(the very words of the witnesses) were falling over one another,
squealing, fighting and laughing with the funniest faces, and, chasing
one another like children, they ran into the street."
"Now take careful
note."
"The bodies upstairs were warm, you understand, warm when they
found them!"
"If they, or Nikolay alone, had murdered them and broken open
the boxes, or simply taken part in the robbery, allow me to ask you one
question: do their state of mind, their squeals and giggles and childish
scuffling at the gate fit in with axes, bloodshed, fiendish cunning,
robbery?"
"They’d just killed them, not five or ten minutes before, for
the bodies were still warm, and at once, leaving the flat open, knowing
that people would go there at once, flinging away their booty, they
rolled about like children, laughing and attracting general attention."
"And there are a dozen witnesses to swear to that!”

“Of course it is strange!"
"It’s impossible, indeed, but...”

“No, brother, no _buts_."
"And if the ear-rings being found in Nikolay’s
hands at the very day and hour of the murder constitutes an important
piece of circumstantial evidence against him--although the explanation
given by him accounts for it, and therefore it does not tell seriously
against him--one must take into consideration the facts which prove him
innocent, especially as they are facts that _cannot be denied_."
"And
do you suppose, from the character of our legal system, that they will
accept, or that they are in a position to accept, this fact--resting
simply on a psychological impossibility--as irrefutable and conclusively
breaking down the circumstantial evidence for the prosecution?"
"No, they
won’t accept it, they certainly won’t, because they found the jewel-case
and the man tried to hang himself, ‘which he could not have done if he
hadn’t felt guilty.’ That’s the point, that’s what excites me, you must
understand!”

“Oh, I see you are excited!"
Wait a bit.
"I forgot to ask you; what proof
is there that the box came from the old woman?”

“That’s been proved,” said Razumihin with apparent reluctance, frowning."
"“Koch recognised the jewel-case and gave the name of the owner, who
proved conclusively that it was his.”

“That’s bad."
Now another point.
"Did anyone see Nikolay at the time
that Koch and Pestryakov were going upstairs at first, and is there no
evidence about that?”

“Nobody did see him,” Razumihin answered with vexation."
"“That’s the
worst of it."
"Even Koch and Pestryakov did not notice them on their way
upstairs, though, indeed, their evidence could not have been worth much."
"They said they saw the flat was open, and that there must be work going
on in it, but they took no special notice and could not remember whether
there actually were men at work in it.”

“Hm!..."
"So the only evidence for the defence is that they were beating
one another and laughing."
"That constitutes a strong presumption, but...
How do you explain the facts yourself?”

“How do I explain them?"
What is there to explain?
It’s clear.
"At any
rate, the direction in which explanation is to be sought is clear, and
the jewel-case points to it."
The real murderer dropped those ear-rings.
"The murderer was upstairs, locked in, when Koch and Pestryakov knocked
at the door."
"Koch, like an ass, did not stay at the door; so the
murderer popped out and ran down, too; for he had no other way of
escape."
"He hid from Koch, Pestryakov and the porter in the flat when
Nikolay and Dmitri had just run out of it."
"He stopped there while the
porter and others were going upstairs, waited till they were out of
hearing, and then went calmly downstairs at the very minute when Dmitri
and Nikolay ran out into the street and there was no one in the entry;
possibly he was seen, but not noticed."
"There are lots of people going
in and out."
"He must have dropped the ear-rings out of his pocket when
he stood behind the door, and did not notice he dropped them, because he
had other things to think of."
"The jewel-case is a conclusive proof that
he did stand there.... That’s how I explain it.”

“Too clever!"
"No, my boy, you’re too clever."
"That beats everything.”

“But, why, why?”

“Why, because everything fits too well... it’s too melodramatic.”

“A-ach!” Razumihin was exclaiming, but at that moment the door opened
and a personage came in who was a stranger to all present."
"CHAPTER V

This was a gentleman no longer young, of a stiff and portly appearance,
and a cautious and sour countenance."
"He began by stopping short in the
doorway, staring about him with offensive and undisguised astonishment,
as though asking himself what sort of place he had come to."
"Mistrustfully and with an affectation of being alarmed and almost
affronted, he scanned Raskolnikov’s low and narrow “cabin.” With the
same amazement he stared at Raskolnikov, who lay undressed, dishevelled,
unwashed, on his miserable dirty sofa, looking fixedly at him."
"Then with
the same deliberation he scrutinised the uncouth, unkempt figure and
unshaven face of Razumihin, who looked him boldly and inquiringly in the
face without rising from his seat."
"A constrained silence lasted for a
couple of minutes, and then, as might be expected, some scene-shifting
took place."
"Reflecting, probably from certain fairly unmistakable signs,
that he would get nothing in this “cabin” by attempting to overawe them,
the gentleman softened somewhat, and civilly, though with some severity,
emphasising every syllable of his question, addressed Zossimov:

“Rodion Romanovitch Raskolnikov, a student, or formerly a student?”

Zossimov made a slight movement, and would have answered, had not
Razumihin anticipated him."
“Here he is lying on the sofa!
"What do you want?”

This familiar “what do you want” seemed to cut the ground from the
feet of the pompous gentleman."
"He was turning to Razumihin, but checked
himself in time and turned to Zossimov again."
"“This is Raskolnikov,” mumbled Zossimov, nodding towards him."
"Then he
gave a prolonged yawn, opening his mouth as wide as possible."
"Then he
lazily put his hand into his waistcoat-pocket, pulled out a huge gold
watch in a round hunter’s case, opened it, looked at it and as slowly
and lazily proceeded to put it back."
"Raskolnikov himself lay without speaking, on his back, gazing
persistently, though without understanding, at the stranger."
"Now that
his face was turned away from the strange flower on the paper, it
was extremely pale and wore a look of anguish, as though he had just
undergone an agonising operation or just been taken from the rack."
"But
the new-comer gradually began to arouse his attention, then his wonder,
then suspicion and even alarm."
"When Zossimov said “This is Raskolnikov”
 he jumped up quickly, sat on the sofa and with an almost defiant, but
weak and breaking, voice articulated:

“Yes, I am Raskolnikov!"
"What do you want?”

The visitor scrutinised him and pronounced impressively:

“Pyotr Petrovitch Luzhin."
"I believe I have reason to hope that my name
is not wholly unknown to you?”

But Raskolnikov, who had expected something quite different, gazed
blankly and dreamily at him, making no reply, as though he heard the
name of Pyotr Petrovitch for the first time."
"“Is it possible that you can up to the present have received no
information?” asked Pyotr Petrovitch, somewhat disconcerted."
"In reply Raskolnikov sank languidly back on the pillow, put his hands
behind his head and gazed at the ceiling."
"A look of dismay came into
Luzhin’s face."
"Zossimov and Razumihin stared at him more inquisitively
than ever, and at last he showed unmistakable signs of embarrassment."
"“I had presumed and calculated,” he faltered, “that a letter posted more
than ten days, if not a fortnight ago...”

“I say, why are you standing in the doorway?” Razumihin interrupted
suddenly."
"“If you’ve something to say, sit down."
"Nastasya and you are so
crowded."
"Nastasya, make room."
"Here’s a chair, thread your way in!”

He moved his chair back from the table, made a little space between the
table and his knees, and waited in a rather cramped position for the
visitor to “thread his way in.” The minute was so chosen that it was
impossible to refuse, and the visitor squeezed his way through, hurrying
and stumbling."
"Reaching the chair, he sat down, looking suspiciously at
Razumihin."
"“No need to be nervous,” the latter blurted out."
"“Rodya has been ill for
the last five days and delirious for three, but now he is recovering and
has got an appetite."
"This is his doctor, who has just had a look at him."
"I am a comrade of Rodya’s, like him, formerly a student, and now I am
nursing him; so don’t you take any notice of us, but go on with your
business.”

“Thank you."
"But shall I not disturb the invalid by my presence and
conversation?” Pyotr Petrovitch asked of Zossimov."
"“N-no,” mumbled Zossimov; “you may amuse him.” He yawned again."
"“He has been conscious a long time, since the morning,” went on
Razumihin, whose familiarity seemed so much like unaffected good-nature
that Pyotr Petrovitch began to be more cheerful, partly, perhaps,
because this shabby and impudent person had introduced himself as a
student."
"“Your mamma,” began Luzhin."
“Hm!” Razumihin cleared his throat loudly.
"Luzhin looked at him
inquiringly."
"“That’s all right, go on.”

Luzhin shrugged his shoulders."
"“Your mamma had commenced a letter to you while I was sojourning in
her neighbourhood."
"On my arrival here I purposely allowed a few days to
elapse before coming to see you, in order that I might be fully
assured that you were in full possession of the tidings; but now, to my
astonishment...”

“I know, I know!” Raskolnikov cried suddenly with impatient vexation."
“So you are the _fiancé_?
"I know, and that’s enough!”

There was no doubt about Pyotr Petrovitch’s being offended this time,
but he said nothing."
"He made a violent effort to understand what it all
meant."
There was a moment’s silence.
"Meanwhile Raskolnikov, who had turned a little towards him when he
answered, began suddenly staring at him again with marked curiosity, as
though he had not had a good look at him yet, or as though something
new had struck him; he rose from his pillow on purpose to stare at
him."
"There certainly was something peculiar in Pyotr Petrovitch’s whole
appearance, something which seemed to justify the title of “fiancé” so
unceremoniously applied to him."
"In the first place, it was evident, far
too much so indeed, that Pyotr Petrovitch had made eager use of his few
days in the capital to get himself up and rig himself out in expectation
of his betrothed--a perfectly innocent and permissible proceeding,
indeed."
"Even his own, perhaps too complacent, consciousness of the
agreeable improvement in his appearance might have been forgiven in such
circumstances, seeing that Pyotr Petrovitch had taken up the rôle of
fiancé."
"All his clothes were fresh from the tailor’s and were all
right, except for being too new and too distinctly appropriate."
"Even
the stylish new round hat had the same significance."
"Pyotr Petrovitch
treated it too respectfully and held it too carefully in his hands."
"The
exquisite pair of lavender gloves, real Louvain, told the same tale,
if only from the fact of his not wearing them, but carrying them in
his hand for show."
"Light and youthful colours predominated in Pyotr
Petrovitch’s attire."
"He wore a charming summer jacket of a fawn shade,
light thin trousers, a waistcoat of the same, new and fine linen, a
cravat of the lightest cambric with pink stripes on it, and the best
of it was, this all suited Pyotr Petrovitch."
"His very fresh and even
handsome face looked younger than his forty-five years at all times."
"His dark, mutton-chop whiskers made an agreeable setting on both sides,
growing thickly upon his shining, clean-shaven chin."
"Even his hair,
touched here and there with grey, though it had been combed and curled
at a hairdresser’s, did not give him a stupid appearance, as curled hair
usually does, by inevitably suggesting a German on his wedding-day."
"If there really was something unpleasing and repulsive in his rather
good-looking and imposing countenance, it was due to quite other
causes."
"After scanning Mr. Luzhin unceremoniously, Raskolnikov smiled
malignantly, sank back on the pillow and stared at the ceiling as
before."
"But Mr. Luzhin hardened his heart and seemed to determine to take no
notice of their oddities."
"“I feel the greatest regret at finding you in this situation,” he began,
again breaking the silence with an effort."
"“If I had been aware of your
illness I should have come earlier."
But you know what business is.
"I
have, too, a very important legal affair in the Senate, not to mention
other preoccupations which you may well conjecture."
"I am expecting your
mamma and sister any minute.”

Raskolnikov made a movement and seemed about to speak; his face showed
some excitement."
"Pyotr Petrovitch paused, waited, but as nothing
followed, he went on:

“... Any minute."
"I have found a lodging for them on their arrival.”

“Where?” asked Raskolnikov weakly."
"“Very near here, in Bakaleyev’s house.”

“That’s in Voskresensky,” put in Razumihin."
"“There are two storeys of
rooms, let by a merchant called Yushin; I’ve been there.”

“Yes, rooms...”

“A disgusting place--filthy, stinking and, what’s more, of doubtful
character."
"Things have happened there, and there are all sorts of queer
people living there."
And I went there about a scandalous business.
"It’s
cheap, though...”

“I could not, of course, find out so much about it, for I am a stranger
in Petersburg myself,” Pyotr Petrovitch replied huffily."
"“However, the
two rooms are exceedingly clean, and as it is for so short a time..."
"I have already taken a permanent, that is, our future flat,” he said,
addressing Raskolnikov, “and I am having it done up."
"And meanwhile I am
myself cramped for room in a lodging with my friend Andrey Semyonovitch
Lebeziatnikov, in the flat of Madame Lippevechsel; it was he who told me
of Bakaleyev’s house, too...”

“Lebeziatnikov?” said Raskolnikov slowly, as if recalling something."
"“Yes, Andrey Semyonovitch Lebeziatnikov, a clerk in the Ministry."
"Do you
know him?”

“Yes... no,” Raskolnikov answered."
"“Excuse me, I fancied so from your inquiry."
"I was once his guardian....
A very nice young man and advanced."
"I like to meet young people: one
learns new things from them.” Luzhin looked round hopefully at them all."
“How do you mean?” asked Razumihin.
"“In the most serious and essential matters,” Pyotr Petrovitch replied,
as though delighted at the question."
"“You see, it’s ten years since I
visited Petersburg."
"All the novelties, reforms, ideas have reached us in
the provinces, but to see it all more clearly one must be in Petersburg."
"And it’s my notion that you observe and learn most by watching the
younger generation."
"And I confess I am delighted...”

“At what?”

“Your question is a wide one."
"I may be mistaken, but I fancy I find
clearer views, more, so to say, criticism, more practicality...”

“That’s true,” Zossimov let drop."
“Nonsense!
There’s no practicality.” Razumihin flew at him.
"“Practicality is a difficult thing to find; it does not drop down from
heaven."
"And for the last two hundred years we have been divorced from
all practical life."
"Ideas, if you like, are fermenting,” he said to
Pyotr Petrovitch, “and desire for good exists, though it’s in a childish
form, and honesty you may find, although there are crowds of brigands."
"Anyway, there’s no practicality."
"Practicality goes well shod.”

“I don’t agree with you,” Pyotr Petrovitch replied, with evident
enjoyment."
"“Of course, people do get carried away and make mistakes,
but one must have indulgence; those mistakes are merely evidence of
enthusiasm for the cause and of abnormal external environment."
"If little
has been done, the time has been but short; of means I will not speak."
"It’s my personal view, if you care to know, that something has been
accomplished already."
"New valuable ideas, new valuable works are
circulating in the place of our old dreamy and romantic authors."
"Literature is taking a maturer form, many injurious prejudices have been
rooted up and turned into ridicule...."
"In a word, we have cut ourselves
off irrevocably from the past, and that, to my thinking, is a great
thing...”

“He’s learnt it by heart to show off!” Raskolnikov pronounced suddenly."
"“What?” asked Pyotr Petrovitch, not catching his words; but he received
no reply."
"“That’s all true,” Zossimov hastened to interpose."
"“Isn’t it so?” Pyotr Petrovitch went on, glancing affably at Zossimov."
"“You must admit,” he went on, addressing Razumihin with a shade of
triumph and superciliousness--he almost added “young man”--“that there
is an advance, or, as they say now, progress in the name of science and
economic truth...”

“A commonplace.”

“No, not a commonplace!"
"Hitherto, for instance, if I were told, ‘love
thy neighbour,’ what came of it?” Pyotr Petrovitch went on, perhaps with
excessive haste."
"“It came to my tearing my coat in half to share with my
neighbour and we both were left half naked."
"As a Russian proverb has
it, ‘Catch several hares and you won’t catch one.’ Science now tells
us, love yourself before all men, for everything in the world rests on
self-interest."
"You love yourself and manage your own affairs properly
and your coat remains whole."
"Economic truth adds that the better private
affairs are organised in society--the more whole coats, so to say--the
firmer are its foundations and the better is the common welfare
organised too."
"Therefore, in acquiring wealth solely and exclusively for
myself, I am acquiring, so to speak, for all, and helping to bring to
pass my neighbour’s getting a little more than a torn coat; and that not
from private, personal liberality, but as a consequence of the general
advance."
"The idea is simple, but unhappily it has been a long time
reaching us, being hindered by idealism and sentimentality."
"And yet it
would seem to want very little wit to perceive it...”

“Excuse me, I’ve very little wit myself,” Razumihin cut in sharply,
“and so let us drop it."
"I began this discussion with an object, but I’ve
grown so sick during the last three years of this chattering to amuse
oneself, of this incessant flow of commonplaces, always the same, that,
by Jove, I blush even when other people talk like that."
"You are in a
hurry, no doubt, to exhibit your acquirements; and I don’t blame you,
that’s quite pardonable."
"I only wanted to find out what sort of man you
are, for so many unscrupulous people have got hold of the progressive
cause of late and have so distorted in their own interests everything
they touched, that the whole cause has been dragged in the mire."
"That’s
enough!”

“Excuse me, sir,” said Luzhin, affronted, and speaking with excessive
dignity."
"“Do you mean to suggest so unceremoniously that I too...”

“Oh, my dear sir... how could I?..."
"Come, that’s enough,” Razumihin
concluded, and he turned abruptly to Zossimov to continue their previous
conversation."
Pyotr Petrovitch had the good sense to accept the disavowal.
"He made up
his mind to take leave in another minute or two."
"“I trust our acquaintance,” he said, addressing Raskolnikov, “may, upon
your recovery and in view of the circumstances of which you are aware,
become closer..."
"Above all, I hope for your return to health...”

Raskolnikov did not even turn his head."
"Pyotr Petrovitch began getting
up from his chair."
"“One of her customers must have killed her,” Zossimov declared
positively."
"“Not a doubt of it,” replied Razumihin."
"“Porfiry doesn’t give his
opinion, but is examining all who have left pledges with her there.”

“Examining them?” Raskolnikov asked aloud."
“Yes.
"What then?”

“Nothing.”

“How does he get hold of them?” asked Zossimov."
"“Koch has given the names of some of them, other names are on the
wrappers of the pledges and some have come forward of themselves.”

“It must have been a cunning and practised ruffian!"
The boldness of it!
"The coolness!”

“That’s just what it wasn’t!” interposed Razumihin."
"“That’s what throws
you all off the scent."
"But I maintain that he is not cunning, not
practised, and probably this was his first crime!"
"The supposition that
it was a calculated crime and a cunning criminal doesn’t work."
"Suppose
him to have been inexperienced, and it’s clear that it was only a chance
that saved him--and chance may do anything."
"Why, he did not foresee
obstacles, perhaps!"
And how did he set to work?
"He took jewels worth
ten or twenty roubles, stuffing his pockets with them, ransacked the
old woman’s trunks, her rags--and they found fifteen hundred roubles,
besides notes, in a box in the top drawer of the chest!"
"He did not know
how to rob; he could only murder."
"It was his first crime, I assure you,
his first crime; he lost his head."
"And he got off more by luck than good
counsel!”

“You are talking of the murder of the old pawnbroker, I believe?” Pyotr
Petrovitch put in, addressing Zossimov."
"He was standing, hat and gloves
in hand, but before departing he felt disposed to throw off a few more
intellectual phrases."
"He was evidently anxious to make a favourable
impression and his vanity overcame his prudence."
“Yes.
"You’ve heard of it?”

“Oh, yes, being in the neighbourhood.”

“Do you know the details?”

“I can’t say that; but another circumstance interests me in the
case--the whole question, so to say."
"Not to speak of the fact that crime
has been greatly on the increase among the lower classes during the last
five years, not to speak of the cases of robbery and arson everywhere,
what strikes me as the strangest thing is that in the higher classes,
too, crime is increasing proportionately."
"In one place one hears of a
student’s robbing the mail on the high road; in another place people of
good social position forge false banknotes; in Moscow of late a whole
gang has been captured who used to forge lottery tickets, and one of
the ringleaders was a lecturer in universal history; then our secretary
abroad was murdered from some obscure motive of gain.... And if this old
woman, the pawnbroker, has been murdered by someone of a higher class
in society--for peasants don’t pawn gold trinkets--how are we to explain
this demoralisation of the civilised part of our society?”

“There are many economic changes,” put in Zossimov."
“How are we to explain it?” Razumihin caught him up.
"“It might be
explained by our inveterate impracticality.”

“How do you mean?”

“What answer had your lecturer in Moscow to make to the question why he
was forging notes?"
"‘Everybody is getting rich one way or another, so I
want to make haste to get rich too.’ I don’t remember the exact words,
but the upshot was that he wants money for nothing, without waiting or
working!"
"We’ve grown used to having everything ready-made, to walking
on crutches, to having our food chewed for us."
"Then the great hour
struck,[*] and every man showed himself in his true colours.”

     [*] The emancipation of the serfs in 1861 is meant."
--TRANSLATOR’S NOTE.
“But morality?
"And so to speak, principles...”

“But why do you worry about it?” Raskolnikov interposed suddenly."
"“It’s
in accordance with your theory!”

“In accordance with my theory?”

“Why, carry out logically the theory you were advocating just now, and
it follows that people may be killed...”

“Upon my word!” cried Luzhin."
"“No, that’s not so,” put in Zossimov."
"Raskolnikov lay with a white face and twitching upper lip, breathing
painfully."
"“There’s a measure in all things,” Luzhin went on superciliously."
"“Economic ideas are not an incitement to murder, and one has but to
suppose...”

“And is it true,” Raskolnikov interposed once more suddenly, again in a
voice quivering with fury and delight in insulting him, “is it true that
you told your _fiancée_... within an hour of her acceptance, that what
pleased you most... was that she was a beggar... because it was better
to raise a wife from poverty, so that you may have complete control over
her, and reproach her with your being her benefactor?”

“Upon my word,” Luzhin cried wrathfully and irritably, crimson with
confusion, “to distort my words in this way!"
"Excuse me, allow me to
assure you that the report which has reached you, or rather, let me say,
has been conveyed to you, has no foundation in truth, and I... suspect
who... in a word... this arrow... in a word, your mamma... She seemed
to me in other things, with all her excellent qualities, of a somewhat
high-flown and romantic way of thinking...."
"But I was a thousand miles
from supposing that she would misunderstand and misrepresent things in
so fanciful a way.... And indeed... indeed...”

“I tell you what,” cried Raskolnikov, raising himself on his pillow and
fixing his piercing, glittering eyes upon him, “I tell you what.”

“What?” Luzhin stood still, waiting with a defiant and offended face."
Silence lasted for some seconds.
"“Why, if ever again... you dare to mention a single word... about my
mother..."
"I shall send you flying downstairs!”

“What’s the matter with you?” cried Razumihin."
“So that’s how it is?” Luzhin turned pale and bit his lip.
"“Let me tell
you, sir,” he began deliberately, doing his utmost to restrain himself
but breathing hard, “at the first moment I saw you you were ill-disposed
to me, but I remained here on purpose to find out more."
"I could forgive
a great deal in a sick man and a connection, but you... never after
this...”

“I am not ill,” cried Raskolnikov."
"“So much the worse...”

“Go to hell!”

But Luzhin was already leaving without finishing his speech, squeezing
between the table and the chair; Razumihin got up this time to let him
pass."
"Without glancing at anyone, and not even nodding to Zossimov, who
had for some time been making signs to him to let the sick man alone,
he went out, lifting his hat to the level of his shoulders to avoid
crushing it as he stooped to go out of the door."
"And even the curve of
his spine was expressive of the horrible insult he had received."
"“How could you--how could you!” Razumihin said, shaking his head in
perplexity."
“Let me alone--let me alone all of you!” Raskolnikov cried in a frenzy.
“Will you ever leave off tormenting me?
I am not afraid of you!
"I am
not afraid of anyone, anyone now!"
Get away from me!
"I want to be alone,
alone, alone!”

“Come along,” said Zossimov, nodding to Razumihin."
"“But we can’t leave him like this!”

“Come along,” Zossimov repeated insistently, and he went out."
"Razumihin
thought a minute and ran to overtake him."
"“It might be worse not to obey him,” said Zossimov on the stairs."
"“He
mustn’t be irritated.”

“What’s the matter with him?”

“If only he could get some favourable shock, that’s what would do it!"
"At
first he was better.... You know he has got something on his mind!"
"Some
fixed idea weighing on him...."
"I am very much afraid so; he must have!”

“Perhaps it’s that gentleman, Pyotr Petrovitch."
"From his conversation
I gather he is going to marry his sister, and that he had received a
letter about it just before his illness....”

“Yes, confound the man!"
he may have upset the case altogether.
"But have
you noticed, he takes no interest in anything, he does not respond to
anything except one point on which he seems excited--that’s the murder?”

“Yes, yes,” Razumihin agreed, “I noticed that, too."
"He is interested,
frightened."
"It gave him a shock on the day he was ill in the police
office; he fainted.”

“Tell me more about that this evening and I’ll tell you something
afterwards."
He interests me very much!
"In half an hour I’ll go and see
him again.... There’ll be no inflammation though.”

“Thanks!"
"And I’ll wait with Pashenka meantime and will keep watch on him
through Nastasya....”

Raskolnikov, left alone, looked with impatience and misery at Nastasya,
but she still lingered."
“Won’t you have some tea now?” she asked.
“Later!
I am sleepy!
"Leave me.”

He turned abruptly to the wall; Nastasya went out."
"CHAPTER VI

But as soon as she went out, he got up, latched the door, undid the
parcel which Razumihin had brought in that evening and had tied up again
and began dressing."
"Strange to say, he seemed immediately to have become
perfectly calm; not a trace of his recent delirium nor of the panic
fear that had haunted him of late."
"It was the first moment of a strange
sudden calm."
"His movements were precise and definite; a firm purpose was
evident in them."
"“To-day, to-day,” he muttered to himself."
"He understood
that he was still weak, but his intense spiritual concentration gave him
strength and self-confidence."
"He hoped, moreover, that he would not
fall down in the street."
"When he had dressed in entirely new clothes, he
looked at the money lying on the table, and after a moment’s thought
put it in his pocket."
It was twenty-five roubles.
"He took also all the
copper change from the ten roubles spent by Razumihin on the clothes."
"Then he softly unlatched the door, went out, slipped downstairs and
glanced in at the open kitchen door."
"Nastasya was standing with her back
to him, blowing up the landlady’s samovar."
She heard nothing.
"Who would
have dreamed of his going out, indeed?"
"A minute later he was in the
street."
"It was nearly eight o’clock, the sun was setting."
"It was as stifling as
before, but he eagerly drank in the stinking, dusty town air."
"His head
felt rather dizzy; a sort of savage energy gleamed suddenly in his
feverish eyes and his wasted, pale and yellow face."
"He did not know and
did not think where he was going, he had one thought only: “that all
_this_ must be ended to-day, once for all, immediately; that he would
not return home without it, because he _would not go on living like
that_.” How, with what to make an end?"
"He had not an idea about it,
he did not even want to think of it."
"He drove away thought; thought
tortured him."
"All he knew, all he felt was that everything must be
changed “one way or another,” he repeated with desperate and immovable
self-confidence and determination."
"From old habit he took his usual walk in the direction of the Hay
Market."
"A dark-haired young man with a barrel organ was standing in
the road in front of a little general shop and was grinding out a very
sentimental song."
"He was accompanying a girl of fifteen, who stood
on the pavement in front of him."
"She was dressed up in a crinoline, a
mantle and a straw hat with a flame-coloured feather in it, all very
old and shabby."
"In a strong and rather agreeable voice, cracked and
coarsened by street singing, she sang in hope of getting a copper from
the shop."
"Raskolnikov joined two or three listeners, took out a five
copeck piece and put it in the girl’s hand."
"She broke off abruptly on a
sentimental high note, shouted sharply to the organ grinder “Come on,”
 and both moved on to the next shop."
"“Do you like street music?” said Raskolnikov, addressing a middle-aged
man standing idly by him."
"The man looked at him, startled and wondering."
"“I love to hear singing to a street organ,” said Raskolnikov, and his
manner seemed strangely out of keeping with the subject--“I like it
on cold, dark, damp autumn evenings--they must be damp--when all the
passers-by have pale green, sickly faces, or better still when wet
snow is falling straight down, when there’s no wind--you know what I
mean?--and the street lamps shine through it...”

“I don’t know...."
"Excuse me...” muttered the stranger, frightened by the
question and Raskolnikov’s strange manner, and he crossed over to the
other side of the street."
"Raskolnikov walked straight on and came out at the corner of the Hay
Market, where the huckster and his wife had talked with Lizaveta; but
they were not there now."
"Recognising the place, he stopped, looked round
and addressed a young fellow in a red shirt who stood gaping before a
corn chandler’s shop."
"“Isn’t there a man who keeps a booth with his wife at this corner?”

“All sorts of people keep booths here,” answered the young man, glancing
superciliously at Raskolnikov."
"“What’s his name?”

“What he was christened.”

“Aren’t you a Zaraïsky man, too?"
"Which province?”

The young man looked at Raskolnikov again."
"“It’s not a province, your excellency, but a district."
"Graciously
forgive me, your excellency!”

“Is that a tavern at the top there?”

“Yes, it’s an eating-house and there’s a billiard-room and you’ll find
princesses there too.... La-la!”

Raskolnikov crossed the square."
"In that corner there was a dense crowd
of peasants."
"He pushed his way into the thickest part of it, looking
at the faces."
"He felt an unaccountable inclination to enter into
conversation with people."
"But the peasants took no notice of him; they
were all shouting in groups together."
"He stood and thought a little and
took a turning to the right in the direction of V.

He had often crossed that little street which turns at an angle, leading
from the market-place to Sadovy Street."
"Of late he had often felt drawn
to wander about this district, when he felt depressed, that he might
feel more so."
"Now he walked along, thinking of nothing."
"At that point there is a great
block of buildings, entirely let out in dram shops and eating-houses;
women were continually running in and out, bare-headed and in their
indoor clothes."
"Here and there they gathered in groups, on the pavement,
especially about the entrances to various festive establishments in
the lower storeys."
"From one of these a loud din, sounds of singing, the
tinkling of a guitar and shouts of merriment, floated into the street."
"A crowd of women were thronging round the door; some were sitting on the
steps, others on the pavement, others were standing talking."
"A drunken
soldier, smoking a cigarette, was walking near them in the road,
swearing; he seemed to be trying to find his way somewhere, but had
forgotten where."
"One beggar was quarrelling with another, and a man dead
drunk was lying right across the road."
"Raskolnikov joined the throng of
women, who were talking in husky voices."
"They were bare-headed and wore
cotton dresses and goatskin shoes."
"There were women of forty and some
not more than seventeen; almost all had blackened eyes."
"He felt strangely attracted by the singing and all the noise and
uproar in the saloon below.... someone could be heard within dancing
frantically, marking time with his heels to the sounds of the guitar
and of a thin falsetto voice singing a jaunty air."
"He listened intently,
gloomily and dreamily, bending down at the entrance and peeping
inquisitively in from the pavement."
"“Oh, my handsome soldier
   Don’t beat me for nothing,”

trilled the thin voice of the singer."
"Raskolnikov felt a great desire to
make out what he was singing, as though everything depended on that."
“Shall I go in?” he thought.
“They are laughing.
From drink.
"Shall I get
drunk?”

“Won’t you come in?” one of the women asked him."
"Her voice was
still musical and less thick than the others, she was young and not
repulsive--the only one of the group."
"“Why, she’s pretty,” he said, drawing himself up and looking at her."
"She smiled, much pleased at the compliment."
"“You’re very nice looking yourself,” she said."
“Isn’t he thin though!” observed another woman in a deep bass.
"“Have you
just come out of a hospital?”

“They’re all generals’ daughters, it seems, but they have all snub
noses,” interposed a tipsy peasant with a sly smile on his face, wearing
a loose coat."
"“See how jolly they are.”

“Go along with you!”

“I’ll go, sweetie!”

And he darted down into the saloon below."
Raskolnikov moved on.
"“I say, sir,” the girl shouted after him."
"“What is it?”

She hesitated."
"“I’ll always be pleased to spend an hour with you, kind gentleman, but
now I feel shy."
"Give me six copecks for a drink, there’s a nice young
man!”

Raskolnikov gave her what came first--fifteen copecks."
"“Ah, what a good-natured gentleman!”

“What’s your name?”

“Ask for Duclida.”

“Well, that’s too much,” one of the women observed, shaking her head
at Duclida."
“I don’t know how you can ask like that.
"I believe I should
drop with shame....”

Raskolnikov looked curiously at the speaker."
"She was a pock-marked wench
of thirty, covered with bruises, with her upper lip swollen."
"She made
her criticism quietly and earnestly."
"“Where is it,” thought Raskolnikov."
"“Where is it I’ve read that someone condemned to death says or thinks,
an hour before his death, that if he had to live on some high rock,
on such a narrow ledge that he’d only room to stand, and the ocean,
everlasting darkness, everlasting solitude, everlasting tempest around
him, if he had to remain standing on a square yard of space all his
life, a thousand years, eternity, it were better to live so than to die
at once!"
"Only to live, to live and live!"
"Life, whatever it may be!..."
How true it is!
"Good God, how true!"
Man is a vile creature!...
"And vile
is he who calls him vile for that,” he added a moment later."
He went into another street.
"“Bah, the Palais de Cristal!"
"Razumihin
was just talking of the Palais de Cristal."
"But what on earth was it
I wanted?"
"Yes, the newspapers.... Zossimov said he’d read it in the
papers."
"Have you the papers?” he asked, going into a very spacious and
positively clean restaurant, consisting of several rooms, which were,
however, rather empty."
"Two or three people were drinking tea, and in a
room further away were sitting four men drinking champagne."
"Raskolnikov
fancied that Zametov was one of them, but he could not be sure at that
distance."
“What if it is?” he thought.
“Will you have vodka?” asked the waiter.
"“Give me some tea and bring me the papers, the old ones for the last
five days, and I’ll give you something.”

“Yes, sir, here’s to-day’s."
"No vodka?”

The old newspapers and the tea were brought."
"Raskolnikov sat down and
began to look through them."
"“Oh, damn... these are the items of intelligence."
"An accident on a
staircase, spontaneous combustion of a shopkeeper from alcohol, a fire
in Peski... a fire in the Petersburg quarter... another fire in the
Petersburg quarter... and another fire in the Petersburg quarter....
Ah, here it is!” He found at last what he was seeking and began to
read it."
"The lines danced before his eyes, but he read it all and began
eagerly seeking later additions in the following numbers."
"His hands
shook with nervous impatience as he turned the sheets."
"Suddenly someone
sat down beside him at his table."
"He looked up, it was the head clerk
Zametov, looking just the same, with the rings on his fingers and the
watch-chain, with the curly, black hair, parted and pomaded, with the
smart waistcoat, rather shabby coat and doubtful linen."
"He was in a good
humour, at least he was smiling very gaily and good-humouredly."
"His dark
face was rather flushed from the champagne he had drunk."
"“What, you here?” he began in surprise, speaking as though he’d known
him all his life."
"“Why, Razumihin told me only yesterday you were
unconscious."
How strange!
"And do you know I’ve been to see you?”

Raskolnikov knew he would come up to him."
"He laid aside the papers and
turned to Zametov."
"There was a smile on his lips, and a new shade of
irritable impatience was apparent in that smile."
"“I know you have,” he answered."
“I’ve heard it.
"You looked for my
sock.... And you know Razumihin has lost his heart to you?"
"He says
you’ve been with him to Luise Ivanovna’s--you know, the woman you tried
to befriend, for whom you winked to the Explosive Lieutenant and he
would not understand."
Do you remember?
"How could he fail to
understand--it was quite clear, wasn’t it?”

“What a hot head he is!”

“The explosive one?”

“No, your friend Razumihin.”

“You must have a jolly life, Mr. Zametov; entrance free to the most
agreeable places."
"Who’s been pouring champagne into you just now?”

“We’ve just been... having a drink together.... You talk about pouring
it into me!”

“By way of a fee!"
"You profit by everything!” Raskolnikov laughed, “it’s
all right, my dear boy,” he added, slapping Zametov on the shoulder."
"“I
am not speaking from temper, but in a friendly way, for sport, as that
workman of yours said when he was scuffling with Dmitri, in the case of
the old woman....”

“How do you know about it?”

“Perhaps I know more about it than you do.”

“How strange you are...."
I am sure you are still very unwell.
"You
oughtn’t to have come out.”

“Oh, do I seem strange to you?”

“Yes."
"What are you doing, reading the papers?”

“Yes.”

“There’s a lot about the fires.”

“No, I am not reading about the fires.” Here he looked mysteriously at
Zametov; his lips were twisted again in a mocking smile."
"“No, I am not
reading about the fires,” he went on, winking at Zametov."
"“But confess
now, my dear fellow, you’re awfully anxious to know what I am reading
about?”

“I am not in the least."
Mayn’t I ask a question?
"Why do you keep
on...?”

“Listen, you are a man of culture and education?”

“I was in the sixth class at the gymnasium,” said Zametov with some
dignity."
“Sixth class!
"Ah, my cock-sparrow!"
"With your parting and your rings--you
are a gentleman of fortune."
Foo!
"what a charming boy!” Here Raskolnikov
broke into a nervous laugh right in Zametov’s face."
"The latter drew
back, more amazed than offended."
“Foo!
how strange you are!” Zametov repeated very seriously.
"“I can’t
help thinking you are still delirious.”

“I am delirious?"
"You are fibbing, my cock-sparrow!"
So I am strange?
"You
find me curious, do you?”

“Yes, curious.”

“Shall I tell you what I was reading about, what I was looking for?"
"See
what a lot of papers I’ve made them bring me."
"Suspicious, eh?”

“Well, what is it?”

“You prick up your ears?”

“How do you mean--‘prick up my ears’?”

“I’ll explain that afterwards, but now, my boy, I declare to you... no,
better ‘I confess’... No, that’s not right either; ‘I make a deposition
and you take it.’ I depose that I was reading, that I was looking and
searching....” he screwed up his eyes and paused."
"“I was searching--and
came here on purpose to do it--for news of the murder of the old
pawnbroker woman,” he articulated at last, almost in a whisper, bringing
his face exceedingly close to the face of Zametov."
"Zametov looked at him
steadily, without moving or drawing his face away."
"What struck Zametov
afterwards as the strangest part of it all was that silence followed for
exactly a minute, and that they gazed at one another all the while."
"“What if you have been reading about it?” he cried at last, perplexed
and impatient."
“That’s no business of mine!
"What of it?”

“The same old woman,” Raskolnikov went on in the same whisper, not
heeding Zametov’s explanation, “about whom you were talking in the
police-office, you remember, when I fainted."
"Well, do you understand
now?”

“What do you mean?"
"Understand... what?” Zametov brought out, almost
alarmed."
"Raskolnikov’s set and earnest face was suddenly transformed, and he
suddenly went off into the same nervous laugh as before, as though
utterly unable to restrain himself."
"And in one flash he recalled with
extraordinary vividness of sensation a moment in the recent past, that
moment when he stood with the axe behind the door, while the latch
trembled and the men outside swore and shook it, and he had a sudden
desire to shout at them, to swear at them, to put out his tongue at
them, to mock them, to laugh, and laugh, and laugh!"
"“You are either mad, or...” began Zametov, and he broke off, as though
stunned by the idea that had suddenly flashed into his mind."
“Or?
Or what?
What?
"Come, tell me!”

“Nothing,” said Zametov, getting angry, “it’s all nonsense!”

Both were silent."
"After his sudden fit of laughter Raskolnikov became
suddenly thoughtful and melancholy."
"He put his elbow on the table and
leaned his head on his hand."
"He seemed to have completely forgotten
Zametov."
The silence lasted for some time.
“Why don’t you drink your tea?
"It’s getting cold,” said Zametov."
“What!
Tea?
"Oh, yes....” Raskolnikov sipped the glass, put a morsel of
bread in his mouth and, suddenly looking at Zametov, seemed to remember
everything and pulled himself together."
"At the same moment his face
resumed its original mocking expression."
He went on drinking tea.
"“There have been a great many of these crimes lately,” said Zametov."
"“Only the other day I read in the _Moscow News_ that a whole gang of
false coiners had been caught in Moscow."
It was a regular society.
"They
used to forge tickets!”

“Oh, but it was a long time ago!"
"I read about it a month ago,”
 Raskolnikov answered calmly."
"“So you consider them criminals?” he added,
smiling."
"“Of course they are criminals.”

“They?"
"They are children, simpletons, not criminals!"
"Why, half a hundred
people meeting for such an object--what an idea!"
"Three would be too
many, and then they want to have more faith in one another than in
themselves!"
One has only to blab in his cups and it all collapses.
Simpletons!
"They engaged untrustworthy people to change the notes--what
a thing to trust to a casual stranger!"
"Well, let us suppose that these
simpletons succeed and each makes a million, and what follows for the
rest of their lives?"
"Each is dependent on the others for the rest of his
life!"
Better hang oneself at once!
"And they did not know how to change
the notes either; the man who changed the notes took five thousand
roubles, and his hands trembled."
"He counted the first four thousand,
but did not count the fifth thousand--he was in such a hurry to get the
money into his pocket and run away."
Of course he roused suspicion.
"And
the whole thing came to a crash through one fool!"
"Is it possible?”

“That his hands trembled?” observed Zametov, “yes, that’s quite
possible."
"That, I feel quite sure, is possible."
"Sometimes one can’t
stand things.”

“Can’t stand that?”

“Why, could you stand it then?"
"No, I couldn’t."
"For the sake of a hundred
roubles to face such a terrible experience?"
"To go with false notes
into a bank where it’s their business to spot that sort of thing!"
"No, I
should not have the face to do it."
"Would you?”

Raskolnikov had an intense desire again “to put his tongue out.” Shivers
kept running down his spine."
"“I should do it quite differently,” Raskolnikov began."
"“This is how I
would change the notes: I’d count the first thousand three or four times
backwards and forwards, looking at every note and then I’d set to the
second thousand; I’d count that half-way through and then hold some
fifty-rouble note to the light, then turn it, then hold it to the light
again--to see whether it was a good one."
"‘I am afraid,’ I would say, ‘a
relation of mine lost twenty-five roubles the other day through a
false note,’ and then I’d tell them the whole story."
"And after I began
counting the third, ‘No, excuse me,’ I would say, ‘I fancy I made a
mistake in the seventh hundred in that second thousand, I am not sure.’
And so I would give up the third thousand and go back to the second and
so on to the end."
"And when I had finished, I’d pick out one from the
fifth and one from the second thousand and take them again to the light
and ask again, ‘Change them, please,’ and put the clerk into such a stew
that he would not know how to get rid of me."
"When I’d finished and had
gone out, I’d come back, ‘No, excuse me,’ and ask for some explanation."
"That’s how I’d do it.”

“Foo!"
"what terrible things you say!” said Zametov, laughing."
"“But all
that is only talk."
I dare say when it came to deeds you’d make a slip.
"I believe that even a practised, desperate man cannot always reckon on
himself, much less you and I."
"To take an example near home--that old
woman murdered in our district."
"The murderer seems to have been a
desperate fellow, he risked everything in open daylight, was saved by
a miracle--but his hands shook, too."
"He did not succeed in robbing the
place, he couldn’t stand it."
"That was clear from the...”

Raskolnikov seemed offended."
“Clear?
"Why don’t you catch him then?” he cried, maliciously gibing at
Zametov."
"“Well, they will catch him.”

“Who?"
You?
Do you suppose you could catch him?
You’ve a tough job!
"A
great point for you is whether a man is spending money or not."
"If he had
no money and suddenly begins spending, he must be the man."
"So that any
child can mislead you.”

“The fact is they always do that, though,” answered Zametov."
"“A man will
commit a clever murder at the risk of his life and then at once he goes
drinking in a tavern."
"They are caught spending money, they are not all
as cunning as you are."
"You wouldn’t go to a tavern, of course?”

Raskolnikov frowned and looked steadily at Zametov."
"“You seem to enjoy the subject and would like to know how I should
behave in that case, too?” he asked with displeasure."
"“I should like to,” Zametov answered firmly and seriously."
"Somewhat too
much earnestness began to appear in his words and looks."
"“Very much?”

“Very much!”

“All right then."
"This is how I should behave,” Raskolnikov began, again
bringing his face close to Zametov’s, again staring at him and speaking
in a whisper, so that the latter positively shuddered."
"“This is what
I should have done."
"I should have taken the money and jewels, I should
have walked out of there and have gone straight to some deserted place
with fences round it and scarcely anyone to be seen, some kitchen garden
or place of that sort."
"I should have looked out beforehand some stone
weighing a hundredweight or more which had been lying in the corner from
the time the house was built."
"I would lift that stone--there would sure
to be a hollow under it, and I would put the jewels and money in that
hole."
"Then I’d roll the stone back so that it would look as before,
would press it down with my foot and walk away."
"And for a year or two,
three maybe, I would not touch it."
"And, well, they could search!"
"There’d
be no trace.”

“You are a madman,” said Zametov, and for some reason he too spoke in a
whisper, and moved away from Raskolnikov, whose eyes were glittering."
"He
had turned fearfully pale and his upper lip was twitching and quivering."
"He bent down as close as possible to Zametov, and his lips began to move
without uttering a word."
"This lasted for half a minute; he knew what he
was doing, but could not restrain himself."
"The terrible word trembled on
his lips, like the latch on that door; in another moment it will break
out, in another moment he will let it go, he will speak out."
"“And what if it was I who murdered the old woman and Lizaveta?” he said
suddenly and--realised what he had done."
Zametov looked wildly at him and turned white as the tablecloth.
"His
face wore a contorted smile."
“But is it possible?” he brought out faintly.
"Raskolnikov looked
wrathfully at him."
"“Own up that you believed it, yes, you did?”

“Not a bit of it, I believe it less than ever now,” Zametov cried
hastily."
“I’ve caught my cock-sparrow!
"So you did believe it before, if now you
believe less than ever?”

“Not at all,” cried Zametov, obviously embarrassed."
"“Have you been
frightening me so as to lead up to this?”

“You don’t believe it then?"
"What were you talking about behind my
back when I went out of the police-office?"
"And why did the explosive
lieutenant question me after I fainted?"
"Hey, there,” he shouted to the
waiter, getting up and taking his cap, “how much?”

“Thirty copecks,” the latter replied, running up."
“And there is twenty copecks for vodka.
"See what a lot of money!” he
held out his shaking hand to Zametov with notes in it."
"“Red notes and
blue, twenty-five roubles."
Where did I get them?
"And where did my new
clothes come from?"
You know I had not a copeck.
"You’ve cross-examined my
landlady, I’ll be bound.... Well, that’s enough!"
"_Assez causé!_ Till we
meet again!”

He went out, trembling all over from a sort of wild hysterical
sensation, in which there was an element of insufferable rapture."
"Yet he
was gloomy and terribly tired."
His face was twisted as after a fit.
His fatigue increased rapidly.
"Any shock, any irritating sensation
stimulated and revived his energies at once, but his strength failed as
quickly when the stimulus was removed."
"Zametov, left alone, sat for a long time in the same place, plunged in
thought."
"Raskolnikov had unwittingly worked a revolution in his brain on
a certain point and had made up his mind for him conclusively."
"“Ilya Petrovitch is a blockhead,” he decided."
"Raskolnikov had hardly opened the door of the restaurant when he
stumbled against Razumihin on the steps."
"They did not see each other
till they almost knocked against each other."
"For a moment they stood
looking each other up and down."
"Razumihin was greatly astounded, then
anger, real anger gleamed fiercely in his eyes."
"“So here you are!” he shouted at the top of his voice--“you ran away
from your bed!"
And here I’ve been looking for you under the sofa!
"We
went up to the garret."
I almost beat Nastasya on your account.
"And here
he is after all."
Rodya!
What is the meaning of it?
"Tell me the whole
truth!"
Confess!
"Do you hear?”

“It means that I’m sick to death of you all and I want to be alone,”
 Raskolnikov answered calmly."
“Alone?
"When you are not able to walk, when your face is as white as a
sheet and you are gasping for breath!"
Idiot!...
"What have you been doing
in the Palais de Cristal?"
"Own up at once!”

“Let me go!” said Raskolnikov and tried to pass him."
"This was too much
for Razumihin; he gripped him firmly by the shoulder."
“Let you go?
You dare tell me to let you go?
"Do you know what I’ll do
with you directly?"
"I’ll pick you up, tie you up in a bundle, carry you
home under my arm and lock you up!”

“Listen, Razumihin,” Raskolnikov began quietly, apparently calm--“can’t
you see that I don’t want your benevolence?"
"A strange desire you have to
shower benefits on a man who... curses them, who feels them a burden in
fact!"
Why did you seek me out at the beginning of my illness?
"Maybe I
was very glad to die."
"Didn’t I tell you plainly enough to-day that
you were torturing me, that I was... sick of you!"
"You seem to want to
torture people!"
"I assure you that all that is seriously hindering my
recovery, because it’s continually irritating me."
"You saw Zossimov
went away just now to avoid irritating me."
"You leave me alone too, for
goodness’ sake!"
"What right have you, indeed, to keep me by force?"
"Don’t
you see that I am in possession of all my faculties now?"
"How, how can
I persuade you not to persecute me with your kindness?"
"I may be
ungrateful, I may be mean, only let me be, for God’s sake, let me be!"
"Let me be, let me be!”

He began calmly, gloating beforehand over the venomous phrases he was
about to utter, but finished, panting for breath, in a frenzy, as he had
been with Luzhin."
"Razumihin stood a moment, thought and let his hand drop."
"“Well, go to hell then,” he said gently and thoughtfully."
"“Stay,” he
roared, as Raskolnikov was about to move."
“Listen to me.
"Let me tell
you, that you are all a set of babbling, posing idiots!"
"If you’ve any
little trouble you brood over it like a hen over an egg."
"And you are
plagiarists even in that!"
"There isn’t a sign of independent life in
you!"
"You are made of spermaceti ointment and you’ve lymph in your veins
instead of blood."
I don’t believe in anyone of you!
"In any circumstances
the first thing for all of you is to be unlike a human being!"
"Stop!” he
cried with redoubled fury, noticing that Raskolnikov was again making
a movement--“hear me out!"
"You know I’m having a house-warming this
evening, I dare say they’ve arrived by now, but I left my uncle there--I
just ran in--to receive the guests."
"And if you weren’t a fool, a common
fool, a perfect fool, if you were an original instead of a translation...
you see, Rodya, I recognise you’re a clever fellow, but you’re a
fool!--and if you weren’t a fool you’d come round to me this evening
instead of wearing out your boots in the street!"
"Since you have gone
out, there’s no help for it!"
"I’d give you a snug easy chair, my landlady
has one... a cup of tea, company.... Or you could lie on the sofa--any
way you would be with us.... Zossimov will be there too."
"Will you come?”

“No.”

“R-rubbish!” Razumihin shouted, out of patience."
“How do you know?
You can’t answer for yourself!
"You don’t know anything about it....
Thousands of times I’ve fought tooth and nail with people and run back
to them afterwards.... One feels ashamed and goes back to a man!"
"So
remember, Potchinkov’s house on the third storey....”

“Why, Mr. Razumihin, I do believe you’d let anybody beat you from sheer
benevolence.”

“Beat?"
Whom?
Me?
I’d twist his nose off at the mere idea!
"Potchinkov’s
house, 47, Babushkin’s flat....”

“I shall not come, Razumihin.” Raskolnikov turned and walked away."
"“I bet you will,” Razumihin shouted after him."
"“I refuse to know you if
you don’t!"
"Stay, hey, is Zametov in there?”

“Yes.”

“Did you see him?”

“Yes.”

“Talked to him?”

“Yes.”

“What about?"
"Confound you, don’t tell me then."
"Potchinkov’s house, 47,
Babushkin’s flat, remember!”

Raskolnikov walked on and turned the corner into Sadovy Street."
Razumihin looked after him thoughtfully.
"Then with a wave of his hand he
went into the house but stopped short of the stairs."
"“Confound it,” he went on almost aloud."
“He talked sensibly but yet...
I am a fool!
As if madmen didn’t talk sensibly!
"And this was just what
Zossimov seemed afraid of.” He struck his finger on his forehead."
"“What
if... how could I let him go off alone?"
"He may drown himself.... Ach,
what a blunder!"
"I can’t.” And he ran back to overtake Raskolnikov, but
there was no trace of him."
"With a curse he returned with rapid steps to
the Palais de Cristal to question Zametov."
"Raskolnikov walked straight to X---- Bridge, stood in the middle, and
leaning both elbows on the rail stared into the distance."
"On parting
with Razumihin, he felt so much weaker that he could scarcely reach this
place."
He longed to sit or lie down somewhere in the street.
"Bending
over the water, he gazed mechanically at the last pink flush of the
sunset, at the row of houses growing dark in the gathering twilight, at
one distant attic window on the left bank, flashing as though on fire in
the last rays of the setting sun, at the darkening water of the canal,
and the water seemed to catch his attention."
"At last red circles flashed
before his eyes, the houses seemed moving, the passers-by, the canal
banks, the carriages, all danced before his eyes."
"Suddenly he started,
saved again perhaps from swooning by an uncanny and hideous sight."
"He
became aware of someone standing on the right side of him; he looked
and saw a tall woman with a kerchief on her head, with a long, yellow,
wasted face and red sunken eyes."
"She was looking straight at him, but
obviously she saw nothing and recognised no one."
"Suddenly she leaned her
right hand on the parapet, lifted her right leg over the railing, then
her left and threw herself into the canal."
"The filthy water parted and
swallowed up its victim for a moment, but an instant later the drowning
woman floated to the surface, moving slowly with the current, her head
and legs in the water, her skirt inflated like a balloon over her back."
“A woman drowning!
"A woman drowning!” shouted dozens of voices; people
ran up, both banks were thronged with spectators, on the bridge people
crowded about Raskolnikov, pressing up behind him."
“Mercy on it!
it’s our Afrosinya!” a woman cried tearfully close by.
“Mercy!
save her!
"kind people, pull her out!”

“A boat, a boat” was shouted in the crowd."
"But there was no need of a
boat; a policeman ran down the steps to the canal, threw off his great
coat and his boots and rushed into the water."
"It was easy to reach her:
she floated within a couple of yards from the steps, he caught hold of
her clothes with his right hand and with his left seized a pole which a
comrade held out to him; the drowning woman was pulled out at once."
"They
laid her on the granite pavement of the embankment."
"She soon recovered
consciousness, raised her head, sat up and began sneezing and coughing,
stupidly wiping her wet dress with her hands."
She said nothing.
"“She’s drunk herself out of her senses,” the same woman’s voice wailed
at her side."
“Out of her senses.
"The other day she tried to hang
herself, we cut her down."
"I ran out to the shop just now, left my little
girl to look after her--and here she’s in trouble again!"
"A neighbour,
gentleman, a neighbour, we live close by, the second house from the end,
see yonder....”

The crowd broke up."
"The police still remained round the woman, someone
mentioned the police station.... Raskolnikov looked on with a strange
sensation of indifference and apathy."
He felt disgusted.
"“No, that’s
loathsome... water... it’s not good enough,” he muttered to himself."
"“Nothing will come of it,” he added, “no use to wait."
"What about the
police office...?"
And why isn’t Zametov at the police office?
"The police
office is open till ten o’clock....” He turned his back to the railing
and looked about him."
"“Very well then!” he said resolutely; he moved from the bridge and
walked in the direction of the police office."
"His heart felt hollow and
empty."
He did not want to think.
"Even his depression had passed, there
was not a trace now of the energy with which he had set out “to make an
end of it all.” Complete apathy had succeeded to it."
"“Well, it’s a way out of it,” he thought, walking slowly and listlessly
along the canal bank."
"“Anyway I’ll make an end, for I want to...."
"But
is it a way out?"
What does it matter!
"There’ll be the square yard of
space--ha!"
But what an end!
Is it really the end?
"Shall I tell them or
not?"
Ah... damn!
How tired I am!
"If I could find somewhere to sit or lie
down soon!"
What I am most ashamed of is its being so stupid.
"But I don’t
care about that either!"
"What idiotic ideas come into one’s head.”

To reach the police office he had to go straight forward and take the
second turning to the left."
It was only a few paces away.
"But at the
first turning he stopped and, after a minute’s thought, turned into a
side street and went two streets out of his way, possibly without any
object, or possibly to delay a minute and gain time."
"He walked, looking
at the ground; suddenly someone seemed to whisper in his ear; he lifted
his head and saw that he was standing at the very gate of _the_ house."
"He had not passed it, he had not been near it since _that_ evening."
"An overwhelming, unaccountable prompting drew him on."
"He went into the
house, passed through the gateway, then into the first entrance on the
right, and began mounting the familiar staircase to the fourth storey."
"The narrow, steep staircase was very dark."
"He stopped at each landing
and looked round him with curiosity; on the first landing the framework
of the window had been taken out."
"“That wasn’t so then,” he thought."
"Here was the flat on the second storey where Nikolay and Dmitri had been
working."
“It’s shut up and the door newly painted.
"So it’s to let.” Then
the third storey and the fourth."
"“Here!” He was perplexed to find the
door of the flat wide open."
"There were men there, he could hear voices;
he had not expected that."
"After brief hesitation he mounted the last
stairs and went into the flat."
"It, too, was being done up; there were
workmen in it."
"This seemed to amaze him; he somehow fancied that he
would find everything as he left it, even perhaps the corpses in the
same places on the floor."
"And now, bare walls, no furniture; it seemed
strange."
He walked to the window and sat down on the window-sill.
"There
were two workmen, both young fellows, but one much younger than the
other."
"They were papering the walls with a new white paper covered with
lilac flowers, instead of the old, dirty, yellow one."
"Raskolnikov for
some reason felt horribly annoyed by this."
"He looked at the new paper
with dislike, as though he felt sorry to have it all so changed."
"The workmen had obviously stayed beyond their time and now they were
hurriedly rolling up their paper and getting ready to go home."
"They took
no notice of Raskolnikov’s coming in; they were talking."
"Raskolnikov
folded his arms and listened."
"“She comes to me in the morning,” said the elder to the younger, “very
early, all dressed up."
‘Why are you preening and prinking?’ says I.
"‘I
am ready to do anything to please you, Tit Vassilitch!’ That’s a way of
going on!"
"And she dressed up like a regular fashion book!”

“And what is a fashion book?” the younger one asked."
"He obviously
regarded the other as an authority."
"“A fashion book is a lot of pictures, coloured, and they come to the
tailors here every Saturday, by post from abroad, to show folks how
to dress, the male sex as well as the female."
They’re pictures.
"The
gentlemen are generally wearing fur coats and for the ladies’ fluffles,
they’re beyond anything you can fancy.”

“There’s nothing you can’t find in Petersburg,” the younger cried
enthusiastically, “except father and mother, there’s everything!”

“Except them, there’s everything to be found, my boy,” the elder
declared sententiously."
"Raskolnikov got up and walked into the other room where the strong box,
the bed, and the chest of drawers had been; the room seemed to him very
tiny without furniture in it."
"The paper was the same; the paper in the
corner showed where the case of ikons had stood."
"He looked at it and
went to the window."
The elder workman looked at him askance.
“What do you want?” he asked suddenly.
"Instead of answering Raskolnikov went into the passage and pulled the
bell."
"The same bell, the same cracked note."
"He rang it a second and
a third time; he listened and remembered."
"The hideous and agonisingly
fearful sensation he had felt then began to come back more and more
vividly."
"He shuddered at every ring and it gave him more and more
satisfaction."
"“Well, what do you want?"
"Who are you?” the workman shouted, going out to
him."
Raskolnikov went inside again.
"“I want to take a flat,” he said."
"“I am looking round.”

“It’s not the time to look at rooms at night!"
"and you ought to come up
with the porter.”

“The floors have been washed, will they be painted?” Raskolnikov went
on."
"“Is there no blood?”

“What blood?”

“Why, the old woman and her sister were murdered here."
"There was a
perfect pool there.”

“But who are you?” the workman cried, uneasy."
"“Who am I?”

“Yes.”

“You want to know?"
"Come to the police station, I’ll tell you.”

The workmen looked at him in amazement."
"“It’s time for us to go, we are late."
"Come along, Alyoshka."
"We must lock
up,” said the elder workman."
"“Very well, come along,” said Raskolnikov indifferently, and going
out first, he went slowly downstairs."
"“Hey, porter,” he cried in the
gateway."
"At the entrance several people were standing, staring at the passers-by;
the two porters, a peasant woman, a man in a long coat and a few others."
Raskolnikov went straight up to them.
“What do you want?” asked one of the porters.
"“Have you been to the police office?”

“I’ve just been there."
"What do you want?”

“Is it open?”

“Of course.”

“Is the assistant there?”

“He was there for a time."
"What do you want?”

Raskolnikov made no reply, but stood beside them lost in thought."
"“He’s been to look at the flat,” said the elder workman, coming forward."
"“Which flat?”

“Where we are at work."
‘Why have you washed away the blood?’ says he.
"‘There has been a murder here,’ says he, ‘and I’ve come to take it.’
And he began ringing at the bell, all but broke it."
"‘Come to the police
station,’ says he."
"‘I’ll tell you everything there.’ He wouldn’t leave
us.”

The porter looked at Raskolnikov, frowning and perplexed."
“Who are you?” he shouted as impressively as he could.
"“I am Rodion Romanovitch Raskolnikov, formerly a student, I live in
Shil’s house, not far from here, flat Number 14, ask the porter, he
knows me.” Raskolnikov said all this in a lazy, dreamy voice, not
turning round, but looking intently into the darkening street."
"“Why have you been to the flat?”

“To look at it.”

“What is there to look at?”

“Take him straight to the police station,” the man in the long coat
jerked in abruptly."
"Raskolnikov looked intently at him over his shoulder and said in the
same slow, lazy tones:

“Come along.”

“Yes, take him,” the man went on more confidently."
"“Why was he going
into _that_, what’s in his mind, eh?”

“He’s not drunk, but God knows what’s the matter with him,” muttered the
workman."
"“But what do you want?” the porter shouted again, beginning to get angry
in earnest--“Why are you hanging about?”

“You funk the police station then?” said Raskolnikov jeeringly."
“How funk it?
"Why are you hanging about?”

“He’s a rogue!” shouted the peasant woman."
"“Why waste time talking to him?” cried the other porter, a huge peasant
in a full open coat and with keys on his belt."
“Get along!
"He is a rogue
and no mistake."
"Get along!”

And seizing Raskolnikov by the shoulder he flung him into the street."
"He
lurched forward, but recovered his footing, looked at the spectators in
silence and walked away."
“Strange man!” observed the workman.
"“There are strange folks about nowadays,” said the woman."
"“You should have taken him to the police station all the same,” said the
man in the long coat."
"“Better have nothing to do with him,” decided the big porter."
"“A regular
rogue!"
"Just what he wants, you may be sure, but once take him up, you
won’t get rid of him.... We know the sort!”

“Shall I go there or not?” thought Raskolnikov, standing in the middle
of the thoroughfare at the cross-roads, and he looked about him, as
though expecting from someone a decisive word."
"But no sound came, all
was dead and silent like the stones on which he walked, dead to him, to
him alone.... All at once at the end of the street, two hundred yards
away, in the gathering dusk he saw a crowd and heard talk and shouts."
"In the middle of the crowd stood a carriage.... A light gleamed in the
middle of the street."
"“What is it?” Raskolnikov turned to the right
and went up to the crowd."
"He seemed to clutch at everything and smiled
coldly when he recognised it, for he had fully made up his mind to go to
the police station and knew that it would all soon be over."
"CHAPTER VII

An elegant carriage stood in the middle of the road with a pair of
spirited grey horses; there was no one in it, and the coachman had got
off his box and stood by; the horses were being held by the bridle....
A mass of people had gathered round, the police standing in front."
"One
of them held a lighted lantern which he was turning on something lying
close to the wheels."
"Everyone was talking, shouting, exclaiming; the
coachman seemed at a loss and kept repeating:

“What a misfortune!"
"Good Lord, what a misfortune!”

Raskolnikov pushed his way in as far as he could, and succeeded at last
in seeing the object of the commotion and interest."
"On the ground a
man who had been run over lay apparently unconscious, and covered with
blood; he was very badly dressed, but not like a workman."
"Blood was
flowing from his head and face; his face was crushed, mutilated and
disfigured."
He was evidently badly injured.
"“Merciful heaven!” wailed the coachman, “what more could I do?"
"If I’d
been driving fast or had not shouted to him, but I was going quietly,
not in a hurry."
"Everyone could see I was going along just like everybody
else."
"A drunken man can’t walk straight, we all know...."
"I saw him
crossing the street, staggering and almost falling."
"I shouted again
and a second and a third time, then I held the horses in, but he fell
straight under their feet!"
"Either he did it on purpose or he was very
tipsy...."
"The horses are young and ready to take fright... they started,
he screamed... that made them worse."
"That’s how it happened!”

“That’s just how it was,” a voice in the crowd confirmed."
"“He shouted, that’s true, he shouted three times,” another voice
declared."
"“Three times it was, we all heard it,” shouted a third."
But the coachman was not very much distressed and frightened.
"It was
evident that the carriage belonged to a rich and important person who
was awaiting it somewhere; the police, of course, were in no little
anxiety to avoid upsetting his arrangements."
"All they had to do was to
take the injured man to the police station and the hospital."
"No one knew
his name."
Meanwhile Raskolnikov had squeezed in and stooped closer over him.
"The
lantern suddenly lighted up the unfortunate man’s face."
"He recognised
him."
“I know him!
"I know him!” he shouted, pushing to the front."
"“It’s a
government clerk retired from the service, Marmeladov."
"He lives close
by in Kozel’s house.... Make haste for a doctor!"
"I will pay, see?” He
pulled money out of his pocket and showed it to the policeman."
"He was in
violent agitation."
The police were glad that they had found out who the man was.
"Raskolnikov gave his own name and address, and, as earnestly as if it
had been his father, he besought the police to carry the unconscious
Marmeladov to his lodging at once."
"“Just here, three houses away,” he said eagerly, “the house belongs to
Kozel, a rich German."
"He was going home, no doubt drunk."
"I know him,
he is a drunkard."
"He has a family there, a wife, children, he has one
daughter...."
"It will take time to take him to the hospital, and there is
sure to be a doctor in the house."
"I’ll pay, I’ll pay!"
"At least he will
be looked after at home... they will help him at once."
"But he’ll die
before you get him to the hospital.” He managed to slip something
unseen into the policeman’s hand."
"But the thing was straightforward
and legitimate, and in any case help was closer here."
"They raised the
injured man; people volunteered to help."
Kozel’s house was thirty yards away.
"Raskolnikov walked behind,
carefully holding Marmeladov’s head and showing the way."
"“This way, this way!"
We must take him upstairs head foremost.
"Turn
round!"
"I’ll pay, I’ll make it worth your while,” he muttered."
"Katerina Ivanovna had just begun, as she always did at every free
moment, walking to and fro in her little room from window to stove and
back again, with her arms folded across her chest, talking to herself
and coughing."
"Of late she had begun to talk more than ever to her eldest
girl, Polenka, a child of ten, who, though there was much she did not
understand, understood very well that her mother needed her, and so
always watched her with her big clever eyes and strove her utmost
to appear to understand."
"This time Polenka was undressing her little
brother, who had been unwell all day and was going to bed."
"The boy was
waiting for her to take off his shirt, which had to be washed at night."
"He was sitting straight and motionless on a chair, with a silent,
serious face, with his legs stretched out straight before him--heels
together and toes turned out."
"He was listening to what his mother was saying to his sister, sitting
perfectly still with pouting lips and wide-open eyes, just as all good
little boys have to sit when they are undressed to go to bed."
"A little
girl, still younger, dressed literally in rags, stood at the screen,
waiting for her turn."
"The door on to the stairs was open to relieve
them a little from the clouds of tobacco smoke which floated in from the
other rooms and brought on long terrible fits of coughing in the poor,
consumptive woman."
"Katerina Ivanovna seemed to have grown even thinner
during that week and the hectic flush on her face was brighter than
ever."
"“You wouldn’t believe, you can’t imagine, Polenka,” she said, walking
about the room, “what a happy luxurious life we had in my papa’s house
and how this drunkard has brought me, and will bring you all, to ruin!"
"Papa was a civil colonel and only a step from being a governor; so that
everyone who came to see him said, ‘We look upon you, Ivan Mihailovitch,
as our governor!’ When I... when...” she coughed violently, “oh, cursed
life,” she cried, clearing her throat and pressing her hands to her
breast, “when I... when at the last ball... at the marshal’s...
Princess Bezzemelny saw me--who gave me the blessing when your father
and I were married, Polenka--she asked at once ‘Isn’t that the pretty
girl who danced the shawl dance at the breaking-up?’ (You must mend
that tear, you must take your needle and darn it as I showed you, or
to-morrow--cough, cough, cough--he will make the hole bigger,” she
articulated with effort.)"
"“Prince Schegolskoy, a kammerjunker, had just
come from Petersburg then... he danced the mazurka with me and wanted to
make me an offer next day; but I thanked him in flattering expressions
and told him that my heart had long been another’s."
"That other was your
father, Polya; papa was fearfully angry.... Is the water ready?"
"Give me
the shirt, and the stockings!"
"Lida,” said she to the youngest one, “you
must manage without your chemise to-night... and lay your stockings out
with it... I’ll wash them together.... How is it that drunken vagabond
doesn’t come in?"
"He has worn his shirt till it looks like a dish-clout,
he has torn it to rags!"
"I’d do it all together, so as not to have to
work two nights running!"
"Oh, dear!"
"(Cough, cough, cough, cough!)"
Again!
"What’s this?” she cried, noticing a crowd in the passage and the men,
who were pushing into her room, carrying a burden."
“What is it?
"What are
they bringing?"
"Mercy on us!”

“Where are we to put him?” asked the policeman, looking round when
Marmeladov, unconscious and covered with blood, had been carried in."
“On the sofa!
"Put him straight on the sofa, with his head this way,”
 Raskolnikov showed him."
“Run over in the road!
Drunk!” someone shouted in the passage.
"Katerina Ivanovna stood, turning white and gasping for breath."
"The
children were terrified."
"Little Lida screamed, rushed to Polenka and
clutched at her, trembling all over."
"Having laid Marmeladov down, Raskolnikov flew to Katerina Ivanovna."
"“For God’s sake be calm, don’t be frightened!” he said, speaking
quickly, “he was crossing the road and was run over by a carriage, don’t
be frightened, he will come to, I told them bring him here... I’ve been
here already, you remember?"
"He will come to; I’ll pay!”

“He’s done it this time!” Katerina Ivanovna cried despairingly and she
rushed to her husband."
"Raskolnikov noticed at once that she was not one of those women who
swoon easily."
"She instantly placed under the luckless man’s head a
pillow, which no one had thought of and began undressing and examining
him."
"She kept her head, forgetting herself, biting her trembling lips
and stifling the screams which were ready to break from her."
Raskolnikov meanwhile induced someone to run for a doctor.
"There was a
doctor, it appeared, next door but one."
"“I’ve sent for a doctor,” he kept assuring Katerina Ivanovna, “don’t be
uneasy, I’ll pay."
Haven’t you water?...
"and give me a napkin or a towel,
anything, as quick as you can...."
"He is injured, but not killed, believe
me.... We shall see what the doctor says!”

Katerina Ivanovna ran to the window; there, on a broken chair in the
corner, a large earthenware basin full of water had been stood, in
readiness for washing her children’s and husband’s linen that night."
"This washing was done by Katerina Ivanovna at night at least twice a
week, if not oftener."
"For the family had come to such a pass that they
were practically without change of linen, and Katerina Ivanovna could
not endure uncleanliness and, rather than see dirt in the house, she
preferred to wear herself out at night, working beyond her strength when
the rest were asleep, so as to get the wet linen hung on a line and dry
by the morning."
"She took up the basin of water at Raskolnikov’s request,
but almost fell down with her burden."
"But the latter had already
succeeded in finding a towel, wetted it and began washing the blood off
Marmeladov’s face."
"Katerina Ivanovna stood by, breathing painfully and pressing her hands
to her breast."
She was in need of attention herself.
"Raskolnikov began
to realise that he might have made a mistake in having the injured man
brought here."
"The policeman, too, stood in hesitation."
"“Polenka,” cried Katerina Ivanovna, “run to Sonia, make haste."
"If you
don’t find her at home, leave word that her father has been run over
and that she is to come here at once... when she comes in."
"Run, Polenka!"
"there, put on the shawl.”

“Run your fastest!” cried the little boy on the chair suddenly, after
which he relapsed into the same dumb rigidity, with round eyes, his
heels thrust forward and his toes spread out."
"Meanwhile the room had become so full of people that you couldn’t have
dropped a pin."
"The policemen left, all except one, who remained for a
time, trying to drive out the people who came in from the stairs."
"Almost
all Madame Lippevechsel’s lodgers had streamed in from the inner rooms
of the flat; at first they were squeezed together in the doorway, but
afterwards they overflowed into the room."
"Katerina Ivanovna flew into a
fury."
"“You might let him die in peace, at least,” she shouted at the crowd,
“is it a spectacle for you to gape at?"
With cigarettes!
"(Cough, cough,
cough!)"
"You might as well keep your hats on.... And there is one in his
hat!..."
Get away!
"You should respect the dead, at least!”

Her cough choked her--but her reproaches were not without result."
"They
evidently stood in some awe of Katerina Ivanovna."
"The lodgers, one after
another, squeezed back into the doorway with that strange inner feeling
of satisfaction which may be observed in the presence of a sudden
accident, even in those nearest and dearest to the victim, from which
no living man is exempt, even in spite of the sincerest sympathy and
compassion."
"Voices outside were heard, however, speaking of the hospital and saying
that they’d no business to make a disturbance here."
"“No business to die!” cried Katerina Ivanovna, and she was rushing to
the door to vent her wrath upon them, but in the doorway came face to
face with Madame Lippevechsel who had only just heard of the accident
and ran in to restore order."
"She was a particularly quarrelsome and
irresponsible German."
"“Ah, my God!” she cried, clasping her hands, “your husband drunken
horses have trampled!"
To the hospital with him!
"I am the landlady!”

“Amalia Ludwigovna, I beg you to recollect what you are saying,”
 Katerina Ivanovna began haughtily (she always took a haughty tone with
the landlady that she might “remember her place” and even now could not
deny herself this satisfaction)."
"“Amalia Ludwigovna...”

“I have you once before told that you to call me Amalia Ludwigovna may
not dare; I am Amalia Ivanovna.”

“You are not Amalia Ivanovna, but Amalia Ludwigovna, and as I am not
one of your despicable flatterers like Mr. Lebeziatnikov, who’s laughing
behind the door at this moment (a laugh and a cry of ‘they are at it
again’ was in fact audible at the door) so I shall always call you
Amalia Ludwigovna, though I fail to understand why you dislike that
name."
"You can see for yourself what has happened to Semyon Zaharovitch;
he is dying."
I beg you to close that door at once and to admit no one.
Let him at least die in peace!
"Or I warn you the Governor-General,
himself, shall be informed of your conduct to-morrow."
"The prince knew
me as a girl; he remembers Semyon Zaharovitch well and has often been
a benefactor to him."
"Everyone knows that Semyon Zaharovitch had many
friends and protectors, whom he abandoned himself from an honourable
pride, knowing his unhappy weakness, but now (she pointed to
Raskolnikov) a generous young man has come to our assistance, who has
wealth and connections and whom Semyon Zaharovitch has known from a
child."
"You may rest assured, Amalia Ludwigovna...”

All this was uttered with extreme rapidity, getting quicker and quicker,
but a cough suddenly cut short Katerina Ivanovna’s eloquence."
"At that
instant the dying man recovered consciousness and uttered a groan; she
ran to him."
"The injured man opened his eyes and without recognition or
understanding gazed at Raskolnikov who was bending over him."
"He drew
deep, slow, painful breaths; blood oozed at the corners of his mouth
and drops of perspiration came out on his forehead."
"Not recognising
Raskolnikov, he began looking round uneasily."
"Katerina Ivanovna looked
at him with a sad but stern face, and tears trickled from her eyes."
“My God!
His whole chest is crushed!
"How he is bleeding,” she said
in despair."
“We must take off his clothes.
"Turn a little, Semyon
Zaharovitch, if you can,” she cried to him."
Marmeladov recognised her.
"“A priest,” he articulated huskily."
"Katerina Ivanovna walked to the window, laid her head against the window
frame and exclaimed in despair:

“Oh, cursed life!”

“A priest,” the dying man said again after a moment’s silence."
"“They’ve gone for him,” Katerina Ivanovna shouted to him, he obeyed her
shout and was silent."
"With sad and timid eyes he looked for her; she
returned and stood by his pillow."
"He seemed a little easier but not for
long."
"Soon his eyes rested on little Lida, his favourite, who was shaking in
the corner, as though she were in a fit, and staring at him with her
wondering childish eyes."
"“A-ah,” he signed towards her uneasily."
He wanted to say something.
“What now?” cried Katerina Ivanovna.
"“Barefoot, barefoot!” he muttered, indicating with frenzied eyes the
child’s bare feet."
"“Be silent,” Katerina Ivanovna cried irritably, “you know why she is
barefooted.”

“Thank God, the doctor,” exclaimed Raskolnikov, relieved."
"The doctor came in, a precise little old man, a German, looking about
him mistrustfully; he went up to the sick man, took his pulse, carefully
felt his head and with the help of Katerina Ivanovna he unbuttoned the
blood-stained shirt, and bared the injured man’s chest."
"It was gashed,
crushed and fractured, several ribs on the right side were broken."
"On the left side, just over the heart, was a large, sinister-looking
yellowish-black bruise--a cruel kick from the horse’s hoof."
"The doctor
frowned."
"The policeman told him that he was caught in the wheel and
turned round with it for thirty yards on the road."
"“It’s wonderful that he has recovered consciousness,” the doctor
whispered softly to Raskolnikov."
“What do you think of him?” he asked.
"“He will die immediately.”

“Is there really no hope?”

“Not the faintest!"
"He is at the last gasp.... His head is badly injured,
too... Hm..."
"I could bleed him if you like, but... it would be useless."
"He is bound to die within the next five or ten minutes.”

“Better bleed him then.”

“If you like...."
"But I warn you it will be perfectly useless.”

At that moment other steps were heard; the crowd in the passage parted,
and the priest, a little, grey old man, appeared in the doorway bearing
the sacrament."
A policeman had gone for him at the time of the accident.
"The doctor changed places with him, exchanging glances with him."
Raskolnikov begged the doctor to remain a little while.
"He shrugged his
shoulders and remained."
All stepped back.
The confession was soon over.
"The dying man probably
understood little; he could only utter indistinct broken sounds."
"Katerina Ivanovna took little Lida, lifted the boy from the chair, knelt
down in the corner by the stove and made the children kneel in front of
her."
"The little girl was still trembling; but the boy, kneeling on his
little bare knees, lifted his hand rhythmically, crossing himself with
precision and bowed down, touching the floor with his forehead, which
seemed to afford him especial satisfaction."
"Katerina Ivanovna bit her
lips and held back her tears; she prayed, too, now and then pulling
straight the boy’s shirt, and managed to cover the girl’s bare shoulders
with a kerchief, which she took from the chest without rising from her
knees or ceasing to pray."
"Meanwhile the door from the inner rooms was
opened inquisitively again."
"In the passage the crowd of spectators from
all the flats on the staircase grew denser and denser, but they did not
venture beyond the threshold."
A single candle-end lighted up the scene.
At that moment Polenka forced her way through the crowd at the door.
"She
came in panting from running so fast, took off her kerchief, looked for
her mother, went up to her and said, “She’s coming, I met her in the
street.” Her mother made her kneel beside her."
"Timidly and noiselessly a young girl made her way through the crowd,
and strange was her appearance in that room, in the midst of want, rags,
death and despair."
"She, too, was in rags, her attire was all of
the cheapest, but decked out in gutter finery of a special stamp,
unmistakably betraying its shameful purpose."
"Sonia stopped short in the
doorway and looked about her bewildered, unconscious of everything."
"She forgot her fourth-hand, gaudy silk dress, so unseemly here with
its ridiculous long train, and her immense crinoline that filled up the
whole doorway, and her light-coloured shoes, and the parasol she brought
with her, though it was no use at night, and the absurd round straw hat
with its flaring flame-coloured feather."
"Under this rakishly-tilted hat
was a pale, frightened little face with lips parted and eyes staring in
terror."
"Sonia was a small thin girl of eighteen with fair hair, rather
pretty, with wonderful blue eyes."
"She looked intently at the bed and the
priest; she too was out of breath with running."
"At last whispers, some
words in the crowd probably, reached her."
"She looked down and took a
step forward into the room, still keeping close to the door."
The service was over.
Katerina Ivanovna went up to her husband again.
"The priest stepped back and turned to say a few words of admonition and
consolation to Katerina Ivanovna on leaving."
"“What am I to do with these?” she interrupted sharply and irritably,
pointing to the little ones."
"“God is merciful; look to the Most High for succour,” the priest began."
“Ach!
"He is merciful, but not to us.”

“That’s a sin, a sin, madam,” observed the priest, shaking his head."
"“And isn’t that a sin?” cried Katerina Ivanovna, pointing to the dying
man."
"“Perhaps those who have involuntarily caused the accident will agree to
compensate you, at least for the loss of his earnings.”

“You don’t understand!” cried Katerina Ivanovna angrily waving her hand."
“And why should they compensate me?
"Why, he was drunk and threw himself
under the horses!"
What earnings?
He brought us in nothing but misery.
"He drank everything away, the drunkard!"
"He robbed us to get drink, he
wasted their lives and mine for drink!"
And thank God he’s dying!
"One
less to keep!”

“You must forgive in the hour of death, that’s a sin, madam, such
feelings are a great sin.”

Katerina Ivanovna was busy with the dying man; she was giving him water,
wiping the blood and sweat from his head, setting his pillow straight,
and had only turned now and then for a moment to address the priest."
"Now
she flew at him almost in a frenzy."
"“Ah, father!"
That’s words and only words!
Forgive!
"If he’d not been run
over, he’d have come home to-day drunk and his only shirt dirty and
in rags and he’d have fallen asleep like a log, and I should have been
sousing and rinsing till daybreak, washing his rags and the children’s
and then drying them by the window and as soon as it was daylight I
should have been darning them."
That’s how I spend my nights!...
"What’s
the use of talking of forgiveness!"
"I have forgiven as it is!”

A terrible hollow cough interrupted her words."
"She put her handkerchief
to her lips and showed it to the priest, pressing her other hand to her
aching chest."
The handkerchief was covered with blood.
"The priest bowed
his head and said nothing."
"Marmeladov was in the last agony; he did not take his eyes off the face
of Katerina Ivanovna, who was bending over him again."
"He kept trying
to say something to her; he began moving his tongue with difficulty and
articulating indistinctly, but Katerina Ivanovna, understanding that he
wanted to ask her forgiveness, called peremptorily to him:

“Be silent!"
No need!
"I know what you want to say!” And the sick man
was silent, but at the same instant his wandering eyes strayed to the
doorway and he saw Sonia."
"Till then he had not noticed her: she was standing in the shadow in a
corner."
“Who’s that?
"Who’s that?” he said suddenly in a thick gasping voice,
in agitation, turning his eyes in horror towards the door where his
daughter was standing, and trying to sit up."
“Lie down!
Lie do-own!” cried Katerina Ivanovna.
"With unnatural strength he had succeeded in propping himself on his
elbow."
"He looked wildly and fixedly for some time on his daughter, as
though not recognising her."
He had never seen her before in such attire.
"Suddenly he recognised her, crushed and ashamed in her humiliation and
gaudy finery, meekly awaiting her turn to say good-bye to her dying
father."
His face showed intense suffering.
“Sonia!
Daughter!
"Forgive!” he cried, and he tried to hold out his hand
to her, but losing his balance, he fell off the sofa, face downwards on
the floor."
"They rushed to pick him up, they put him on the sofa; but he
was dying."
"Sonia with a faint cry ran up, embraced him and remained so
without moving."
He died in her arms.
"“He’s got what he wanted,” Katerina Ivanovna cried, seeing her husband’s
dead body."
"“Well, what’s to be done now?"
How am I to bury him!
"What can
I give them to-morrow to eat?”

Raskolnikov went up to Katerina Ivanovna."
"“Katerina Ivanovna,” he began, “last week your husband told me all his
life and circumstances...."
"Believe me, he spoke of you with passionate
reverence."
"From that evening, when I learnt how devoted he was to you
all and how he loved and respected you especially, Katerina Ivanovna,
in spite of his unfortunate weakness, from that evening we became
friends...."
"Allow me now... to do something... to repay my debt to my
dead friend."
"Here are twenty roubles, I think--and if that can be of any
assistance to you, then..."
"I... in short, I will come again, I will
be sure to come again..."
"I shall, perhaps, come again to-morrow....
Good-bye!”

And he went quickly out of the room, squeezing his way through the crowd
to the stairs."
"But in the crowd he suddenly jostled against Nikodim
Fomitch, who had heard of the accident and had come to give instructions
in person."
"They had not met since the scene at the police station, but
Nikodim Fomitch knew him instantly."
"“Ah, is that you?” he asked him."
"“He’s dead,” answered Raskolnikov."
"“The doctor and the priest have been,
all as it should have been."
"Don’t worry the poor woman too much, she is
in consumption as it is."
"Try and cheer her up, if possible... you are a
kind-hearted man, I know...” he added with a smile, looking straight in
his face."
"“But you are spattered with blood,” observed Nikodim Fomitch, noticing
in the lamplight some fresh stains on Raskolnikov’s waistcoat."
"“Yes... I’m covered with blood,” Raskolnikov said with a peculiar air;
then he smiled, nodded and went downstairs."
"He walked down slowly and deliberately, feverish but not conscious
of it, entirely absorbed in a new overwhelming sensation of life and
strength that surged up suddenly within him."
"This sensation might be
compared to that of a man condemned to death who has suddenly been
pardoned."
"Halfway down the staircase he was overtaken by the priest on
his way home; Raskolnikov let him pass, exchanging a silent greeting
with him."
"He was just descending the last steps when he heard rapid
footsteps behind him."
Someone overtook him; it was Polenka.
"She was
running after him, calling “Wait!"
"wait!”

He turned round."
"She was at the bottom of the staircase and stopped
short a step above him."
A dim light came in from the yard.
"Raskolnikov
could distinguish the child’s thin but pretty little face, looking at
him with a bright childish smile."
"She had run after him with a message
which she was evidently glad to give."
"“Tell me, what is your name?..."
"and where do you live?” she said
hurriedly in a breathless voice."
"He laid both hands on her shoulders and looked at her with a sort of
rapture."
"It was such a joy to him to look at her, he could not have said
why."
"“Who sent you?”

“Sister Sonia sent me,” answered the girl, smiling still more brightly."
"“I knew it was sister Sonia sent you.”

“Mamma sent me, too... when sister Sonia was sending me, mamma came up,
too, and said ‘Run fast, Polenka.’”

“Do you love sister Sonia?”

“I love her more than anyone,” Polenka answered with a peculiar
earnestness, and her smile became graver."
"“And will you love me?”

By way of answer he saw the little girl’s face approaching him, her full
lips naïvely held out to kiss him."
"Suddenly her arms as thin as sticks
held him tightly, her head rested on his shoulder and the little girl
wept softly, pressing her face against him."
"“I am sorry for father,” she said a moment later, raising her
tear-stained face and brushing away the tears with her hands."
"“It’s
nothing but misfortunes now,” she added suddenly with that peculiarly
sedate air which children try hard to assume when they want to speak
like grown-up people."
"“Did your father love you?”

“He loved Lida most,” she went on very seriously without a smile,
exactly like grown-up people, “he loved her because she is little and
because she is ill, too."
And he always used to bring her presents.
"But
he taught us to read and me grammar and scripture, too,” she added with
dignity."
"“And mother never used to say anything, but we knew that she
liked it and father knew it, too."
"And mother wants to teach me French,
for it’s time my education began.”

“And do you know your prayers?”

“Of course, we do!"
We knew them long ago.
"I say my prayers to myself
as I am a big girl now, but Kolya and Lida say them aloud with mother."
"First they repeat the ‘Ave Maria’ and then another prayer: ‘Lord,
forgive and bless sister Sonia,’ and then another, ‘Lord, forgive and
bless our second father.’ For our elder father is dead and this is
another one, but we do pray for the other as well.”

“Polenka, my name is Rodion."
"Pray sometimes for me, too."
"‘And Thy
servant Rodion,’ nothing more.”

“I’ll pray for you all the rest of my life,” the little girl declared
hotly, and suddenly smiling again she rushed at him and hugged him
warmly once more."
"Raskolnikov told her his name and address and promised to be sure to
come next day."
The child went away quite enchanted with him.
"It was past
ten when he came out into the street."
"In five minutes he was standing on
the bridge at the spot where the woman had jumped in."
"“Enough,” he pronounced resolutely and triumphantly."
"“I’ve done with
fancies, imaginary terrors and phantoms!"
Life is real!
"haven’t I lived
just now?"
My life has not yet died with that old woman!
"The Kingdom of
Heaven to her--and now enough, madam, leave me in peace!"
"Now for the
reign of reason and light... and of will, and of strength... and now
we will see!"
"We will try our strength!” he added defiantly, as though
challenging some power of darkness."
"“And I was ready to consent to live
in a square of space!"
"“I am very weak at this moment, but..."
I believe my illness is all over.
I knew it would be over when I went out.
"By the way, Potchinkov’s house
is only a few steps away."
"I certainly must go to Razumihin even if
it were not close by... let him win his bet!"
"Let us give him some
satisfaction, too--no matter!"
"Strength, strength is what one wants, you
can get nothing without it, and strength must be won by strength--that’s
what they don’t know,” he added proudly and self-confidently and
he walked with flagging footsteps from the bridge."
"Pride and
self-confidence grew continually stronger in him; he was becoming
a different man every moment."
"What was it had happened to work this
revolution in him?"
"He did not know himself; like a man catching at a
straw, he suddenly felt that he, too, ‘could live, that there was still
life for him, that his life had not died with the old woman.’ Perhaps he
was in too great a hurry with his conclusions, but he did not think of
that."
"“But I did ask her to remember ‘Thy servant Rodion’ in her prayers,” the
idea struck him."
"“Well, that was... in case of emergency,” he added and
laughed himself at his boyish sally."
He was in the best of spirits.
"He easily found Razumihin; the new lodger was already known at
Potchinkov’s and the porter at once showed him the way."
"Half-way
upstairs he could hear the noise and animated conversation of a big
gathering of people."
"The door was wide open on the stairs; he could
hear exclamations and discussion."
"Razumihin’s room was fairly large; the
company consisted of fifteen people."
"Raskolnikov stopped in the entry,
where two of the landlady’s servants were busy behind a screen with two
samovars, bottles, plates and dishes of pie and savouries, brought up
from the landlady’s kitchen."
Raskolnikov sent in for Razumihin.
"He ran
out delighted."
"At the first glance it was apparent that he had had a
great deal to drink and, though no amount of liquor made Razumihin quite
drunk, this time he was perceptibly affected by it."
"“Listen,” Raskolnikov hastened to say, “I’ve only just come to tell you
you’ve won your bet and that no one really knows what may not happen to
him."
I can’t come in; I am so weak that I shall fall down directly.
"And
so good evening and good-bye!"
"Come and see me to-morrow.”

“Do you know what?"
I’ll see you home.
"If you say you’re weak yourself,
you must...”

“And your visitors?"
"Who is the curly-headed one who has just peeped
out?”

“He?"
Goodness only knows!
"Some friend of uncle’s, I expect, or perhaps
he has come without being invited... I’ll leave uncle with them, he
is an invaluable person, pity I can’t introduce you to him now."
"But
confound them all now!"
"They won’t notice me, and I need a little fresh
air, for you’ve come just in the nick of time--another two minutes and I
should have come to blows!"
"They are talking such a lot of wild stuff...
you simply can’t imagine what men will say!"
"Though why shouldn’t you
imagine?"
Don’t we talk nonsense ourselves?
"And let them... that’s the
way to learn not to!..."
"Wait a minute, I’ll fetch Zossimov.”

Zossimov pounced upon Raskolnikov almost greedily; he showed a special
interest in him; soon his face brightened."
"“You must go to bed at once,” he pronounced, examining the patient as
far as he could, “and take something for the night."
Will you take it?
"I
got it ready some time ago... a powder.”

“Two, if you like,” answered Raskolnikov."
The powder was taken at once.
"“It’s a good thing you are taking him home,” observed Zossimov to
Razumihin--“we shall see how he is to-morrow, to-day he’s not at all
amiss--a considerable change since the afternoon."
"Live and learn...”

“Do you know what Zossimov whispered to me when we were coming out?”
 Razumihin blurted out, as soon as they were in the street."
"“I won’t tell
you everything, brother, because they are such fools."
"Zossimov told me
to talk freely to you on the way and get you to talk freely to me, and
afterwards I am to tell him about it, for he’s got a notion in his head
that you are... mad or close on it."
Only fancy!
"In the first place,
you’ve three times the brains he has; in the second, if you are not mad,
you needn’t care a hang that he has got such a wild idea; and thirdly,
that piece of beef whose specialty is surgery has gone mad on mental
diseases, and what’s brought him to this conclusion about you was your
conversation to-day with Zametov.”

“Zametov told you all about it?”

“Yes, and he did well."
"Now I understand what it all means and so does
Zametov.... Well, the fact is, Rodya... the point is..."
"I am a little
drunk now...."
"But that’s... no matter... the point is that this
idea... you understand?"
"was just being hatched in their brains... you
understand?"
"That is, no one ventured to say it aloud, because the idea
is too absurd and especially since the arrest of that painter, that
bubble’s burst and gone for ever."
But why are they such fools?
"I gave
Zametov a bit of a thrashing at the time--that’s between ourselves,
brother; please don’t let out a hint that you know of it; I’ve noticed
he is a ticklish subject; it was at Luise Ivanovna’s."
"But to-day, to-day
it’s all cleared up."
That Ilya Petrovitch is at the bottom of it!
"He
took advantage of your fainting at the police station, but he is ashamed
of it himself now; I know that...”

Raskolnikov listened greedily."
"Razumihin was drunk enough to talk too
freely."
"“I fainted then because it was so close and the smell of paint,” said
Raskolnikov."
“No need to explain that!
"And it wasn’t the paint only: the fever had
been coming on for a month; Zossimov testifies to that!"
"But how crushed
that boy is now, you wouldn’t believe!"
"‘I am not worth his little
finger,’ he says."
"Yours, he means."
"He has good feelings at times,
brother."
"But the lesson, the lesson you gave him to-day in the Palais
de Cristal, that was too good for anything!"
"You frightened him at first,
you know, he nearly went into convulsions!"
"You almost convinced
him again of the truth of all that hideous nonsense, and then you
suddenly--put out your tongue at him: ‘There now, what do you make of
it?’ It was perfect!"
"He is crushed, annihilated now!"
"It was masterly, by
Jove, it’s what they deserve!"
"Ah, that I wasn’t there!"
"He was hoping to
see you awfully."
"Porfiry, too, wants to make your acquaintance...”

“Ah!..."
"he too... but why did they put me down as mad?”

“Oh, not mad."
"I must have said too much, brother.... What struck him,
you see, was that only that subject seemed to interest you; now it’s
clear why it did interest you; knowing all the circumstances... and
how that irritated you and worked in with your illness..."
"I am a little
drunk, brother, only, confound him, he has some idea of his own..."
"I
tell you, he’s mad on mental diseases."
"But don’t you mind him...”

For half a minute both were silent."
"“Listen, Razumihin,” began Raskolnikov, “I want to tell you plainly:
I’ve just been at a death-bed, a clerk who died..."
"I gave them all my
money... and besides I’ve just been kissed by someone who, if I had
killed anyone, would just the same... in fact I saw someone else
there... with a flame-coloured feather... but I am talking nonsense; I
am very weak, support me... we shall be at the stairs directly...”

“What’s the matter?"
"What’s the matter with you?” Razumihin asked
anxiously."
"“I am a little giddy, but that’s not the point, I am so sad, so sad...
like a woman."
"Look, what’s that?"
"Look, look!”

“What is it?”

“Don’t you see?"
"A light in my room, you see?"
"Through the crack...”

They were already at the foot of the last flight of stairs, at the level
of the landlady’s door, and they could, as a fact, see from below that
there was a light in Raskolnikov’s garret."
“Queer!
"Nastasya, perhaps,” observed Razumihin."
"“She is never in my room at this time and she must be in bed long ago,
but..."
I don’t care!
"Good-bye!”

“What do you mean?"
"I am coming with you, we’ll come in together!”

“I know we are going in together, but I want to shake hands here and say
good-bye to you here."
"So give me your hand, good-bye!”

“What’s the matter with you, Rodya?”

“Nothing... come along... you shall be witness.”

They began mounting the stairs, and the idea struck Razumihin that
perhaps Zossimov might be right after all."
"“Ah, I’ve upset him with my
chatter!” he muttered to himself."
When they reached the door they heard voices in the room.
“What is it?” cried Razumihin.
"Raskolnikov was the first to open the
door; he flung it wide and stood still in the doorway, dumbfoundered."
"His mother and sister were sitting on his sofa and had been waiting an
hour and a half for him."
"Why had he never expected, never thought of
them, though the news that they had started, were on their way and would
arrive immediately, had been repeated to him only that day?"
"They had
spent that hour and a half plying Nastasya with questions."
"She was
standing before them and had told them everything by now."
"They were
beside themselves with alarm when they heard of his “running away”
 to-day, ill and, as they understood from her story, delirious!"
"“Good
Heavens, what had become of him?” Both had been weeping, both had been
in anguish for that hour and a half."
"A cry of joy, of ecstasy, greeted Raskolnikov’s entrance."
"Both rushed to
him."
"But he stood like one dead; a sudden intolerable sensation struck
him like a thunderbolt."
"He did not lift his arms to embrace them, he
could not."
"His mother and sister clasped him in their arms, kissed him,
laughed and cried."
"He took a step, tottered and fell to the ground,
fainting."
"Anxiety, cries of horror, moans... Razumihin who was standing in the
doorway flew into the room, seized the sick man in his strong arms and
in a moment had him on the sofa."
"“It’s nothing, nothing!” he cried to the mother and sister--“it’s only a
faint, a mere trifle!"
"Only just now the doctor said he was much better,
that he is perfectly well!"
Water!
"See, he is coming to himself, he is
all right again!”

And seizing Dounia by the arm so that he almost dislocated it, he made
her bend down to see that “he is all right again.” The mother and sister
looked on him with emotion and gratitude, as their Providence."
"They
had heard already from Nastasya all that had been done for their Rodya
during his illness, by this “very competent young man,” as Pulcheria
Alexandrovna Raskolnikov called him that evening in conversation with
Dounia."
"PART III



CHAPTER I

Raskolnikov got up, and sat down on the sofa."
"He waved his hand weakly
to Razumihin to cut short the flow of warm and incoherent consolations
he was addressing to his mother and sister, took them both by the hand
and for a minute or two gazed from one to the other without speaking."
His mother was alarmed by his expression.
"It revealed an emotion
agonisingly poignant, and at the same time something immovable, almost
insane."
Pulcheria Alexandrovna began to cry.
Avdotya Romanovna was pale; her hand trembled in her brother’s.
"“Go home... with him,” he said in a broken voice, pointing to Razumihin,
“good-bye till to-morrow; to-morrow everything... Is it long since you
arrived?”

“This evening, Rodya,” answered Pulcheria Alexandrovna, “the train was
awfully late."
"But, Rodya, nothing would induce me to leave you now!"
"I
will spend the night here, near you...”

“Don’t torture me!” he said with a gesture of irritation."
"“I will stay with him,” cried Razumihin, “I won’t leave him for a
moment."
Bother all my visitors!
Let them rage to their hearts’ content!
"My uncle is presiding there.”

“How, how can I thank you!” Pulcheria Alexandrovna was beginning, once
more pressing Razumihin’s hands, but Raskolnikov interrupted her again."
“I can’t have it!
"I can’t have it!” he repeated irritably, “don’t worry
me!"
"Enough, go away..."
"I can’t stand it!”

“Come, mamma, come out of the room at least for a minute,” Dounia
whispered in dismay; “we are distressing him, that’s evident.”

“Mayn’t I look at him after three years?” wept Pulcheria Alexandrovna."
"“Stay,” he stopped them again, “you keep interrupting me, and my ideas
get muddled.... Have you seen Luzhin?”

“No, Rodya, but he knows already of our arrival."
"We have heard, Rodya,
that Pyotr Petrovitch was so kind as to visit you today,” Pulcheria
Alexandrovna added somewhat timidly."
"“Yes... he was so kind... Dounia, I promised Luzhin I’d throw him
downstairs and told him to go to hell....”

“Rodya, what are you saying!"
"Surely, you don’t mean to tell us...”
 Pulcheria Alexandrovna began in alarm, but she stopped, looking at
Dounia."
"Avdotya Romanovna was looking attentively at her brother, waiting
for what would come next."
"Both of them had heard of the quarrel from
Nastasya, so far as she had succeeded in understanding and reporting it,
and were in painful perplexity and suspense."
"“Dounia,” Raskolnikov continued with an effort, “I don’t want that
marriage, so at the first opportunity to-morrow you must refuse Luzhin,
so that we may never hear his name again.”

“Good Heavens!” cried Pulcheria Alexandrovna."
"“Brother, think what you are saying!” Avdotya Romanovna began
impetuously, but immediately checked herself."
"“You are not fit to talk
now, perhaps; you are tired,” she added gently."
“You think I am delirious?
"No... You are marrying Luzhin for _my_
sake."
But I won’t accept the sacrifice.
"And so write a letter before
to-morrow, to refuse him... Let me read it in the morning and that will
be the end of it!”

“That I can’t do!” the girl cried, offended, “what right have you...”

“Dounia, you are hasty, too, be quiet, to-morrow... Don’t you see...”
 the mother interposed in dismay."
"“Better come away!”

“He is raving,” Razumihin cried tipsily, “or how would he dare!"
"To-morrow all this nonsense will be over... to-day he certainly did
drive him away."
That was so.
"And Luzhin got angry, too...."
"He made
speeches here, wanted to show off his learning and he went out
crest-fallen....”

“Then it’s true?” cried Pulcheria Alexandrovna."
"“Good-bye till to-morrow, brother,” said Dounia compassionately--“let us
go, mother... Good-bye, Rodya.”

“Do you hear, sister,” he repeated after them, making a last effort,
“I am not delirious; this marriage is--an infamy."
"Let me act like
a scoundrel, but you mustn’t... one is enough... and though I am a
scoundrel, I wouldn’t own such a sister."
It’s me or Luzhin!
"Go now....”

“But you’re out of your mind!"
"Despot!” roared Razumihin; but Raskolnikov
did not and perhaps could not answer."
"He lay down on the sofa, and
turned to the wall, utterly exhausted."
"Avdotya Romanovna looked with
interest at Razumihin; her black eyes flashed; Razumihin positively
started at her glance."
Pulcheria Alexandrovna stood overwhelmed.
"“Nothing would induce me to go,” she whispered in despair to Razumihin."
"“I will stay somewhere here... escort Dounia home.”

“You’ll spoil everything,” Razumihin answered in the same whisper,
losing patience--“come out on to the stairs, anyway."
"Nastasya, show a
light!"
"I assure you,” he went on in a half whisper on the stairs--“that
he was almost beating the doctor and me this afternoon!"
"Do you
understand?"
The doctor himself!
"Even he gave way and left him, so as not
to irritate him."
"I remained downstairs on guard, but he dressed at once
and slipped off."
"And he will slip off again if you irritate him, at this
time of night, and will do himself some mischief....”

“What are you saying?”

“And Avdotya Romanovna can’t possibly be left in those lodgings without
you."
Just think where you are staying!
"That blackguard Pyotr Petrovitch
couldn’t find you better lodgings..."
"But you know I’ve had a little to
drink, and that’s what makes me... swear; don’t mind it....”

“But I’ll go to the landlady here,” Pulcheria Alexandrovna insisted,
“I’ll beseech her to find some corner for Dounia and me for the night."
"I
can’t leave him like that, I cannot!”

This conversation took place on the landing just before the landlady’s
door."
Nastasya lighted them from a step below.
"Razumihin was in
extraordinary excitement."
"Half an hour earlier, while he was bringing
Raskolnikov home, he had indeed talked too freely, but he was aware of
it himself, and his head was clear in spite of the vast quantities he
had imbibed."
"Now he was in a state bordering on ecstasy, and all that he
had drunk seemed to fly to his head with redoubled effect."
"He stood with
the two ladies, seizing both by their hands, persuading them, and giving
them reasons with astonishing plainness of speech, and at almost every
word he uttered, probably to emphasise his arguments, he squeezed their
hands painfully as in a vise."
"He stared at Avdotya Romanovna without the
least regard for good manners."
"They sometimes pulled their hands out of
his huge bony paws, but far from noticing what was the matter, he drew
them all the closer to him."
"If they’d told him to jump head foremost
from the staircase, he would have done it without thought or hesitation
in their service."
"Though Pulcheria Alexandrovna felt that the young man
was really too eccentric and pinched her hand too much, in her anxiety
over her Rodya she looked on his presence as providential, and was
unwilling to notice all his peculiarities."
"But though Avdotya Romanovna
shared her anxiety, and was not of timorous disposition, she could not
see the glowing light in his eyes without wonder and almost alarm."
"It
was only the unbounded confidence inspired by Nastasya’s account of her
brother’s queer friend, which prevented her from trying to run away from
him, and to persuade her mother to do the same."
"She realised, too,
that even running away was perhaps impossible now."
"Ten minutes later,
however, she was considerably reassured; it was characteristic of
Razumihin that he showed his true nature at once, whatever mood he might
be in, so that people quickly saw the sort of man they had to deal with."
"“You can’t go to the landlady, that’s perfect nonsense!” he cried."
"“If
you stay, though you are his mother, you’ll drive him to a frenzy, and
then goodness knows what will happen!"
"Listen, I’ll tell you what I’ll
do: Nastasya will stay with him now, and I’ll conduct you both home, you
can’t be in the streets alone; Petersburg is an awful place in that
way...."
But no matter!
"Then I’ll run straight back here and a quarter of
an hour later, on my word of honour, I’ll bring you news how he is,
whether he is asleep, and all that."
"Then, listen!"
"Then I’ll run home in
a twinkling--I’ve a lot of friends there, all drunk--I’ll fetch
Zossimov--that’s the doctor who is looking after him, he is there, too,
but he is not drunk; he is not drunk, he is never drunk!"
"I’ll drag him
to Rodya, and then to you, so that you’ll get two reports in the
hour--from the doctor, you understand, from the doctor himself, that’s a
very different thing from my account of him!"
"If there’s anything wrong,
I swear I’ll bring you here myself, but, if it’s all right, you go to
bed."
"And I’ll spend the night here, in the passage, he won’t hear me,
and I’ll tell Zossimov to sleep at the landlady’s, to be at hand."
"Which
is better for him: you or the doctor?"
So come home then!
"But the
landlady is out of the question; it’s all right for me, but it’s out of
the question for you: she wouldn’t take you, for she’s... for she’s a
fool... She’d be jealous on my account of Avdotya Romanovna and of you,
too, if you want to know... of Avdotya Romanovna certainly."
"She is an
absolutely, absolutely unaccountable character!"
"But I am a fool, too!..."
No matter!
Come along!
Do you trust me?
"Come, do you trust me or not?”

“Let us go, mother,” said Avdotya Romanovna, “he will certainly do what
he has promised."
"He has saved Rodya already, and if the doctor really
will consent to spend the night here, what could be better?”

“You see, you... you... understand me, because you are an angel!”
 Razumihin cried in ecstasy, “let us go!"
Nastasya!
"Fly upstairs and sit
with him with a light; I’ll come in a quarter of an hour.”

Though Pulcheria Alexandrovna was not perfectly convinced, she made no
further resistance."
"Razumihin gave an arm to each and drew them down
the stairs."
"He still made her uneasy, as though he was competent and
good-natured, was he capable of carrying out his promise?"
"He seemed in
such a condition....

“Ah, I see you think I am in such a condition!” Razumihin broke in upon
her thoughts, guessing them, as he strolled along the pavement with huge
steps, so that the two ladies could hardly keep up with him, a fact he
did not observe, however."
“Nonsense!
That is...
"I am drunk like a fool,
but that’s not it; I am not drunk from wine."
"It’s seeing you has turned
my head..."
But don’t mind me!
"Don’t take any notice: I am talking
nonsense, I am not worthy of you...."
I am utterly unworthy of you!
"The
minute I’ve taken you home, I’ll pour a couple of pailfuls of water over
my head in the gutter here, and then I shall be all right...."
"If only
you knew how I love you both!"
"Don’t laugh, and don’t be angry!"
"You may
be angry with anyone, but not with me!"
"I am his friend, and therefore I
am your friend, too, I want to be..."
"I had a presentiment... Last year
there was a moment... though it wasn’t a presentiment really, for
you seem to have fallen from heaven."
"And I expect I shan’t sleep all
night... Zossimov was afraid a little time ago that he would go mad...
that’s why he mustn’t be irritated.”

“What do you say?” cried the mother."
"“Did the doctor really say that?” asked Avdotya Romanovna, alarmed."
"“Yes, but it’s not so, not a bit of it."
"He gave him some medicine, a
powder, I saw it, and then your coming here.... Ah!"
"It would have been
better if you had come to-morrow."
It’s a good thing we went away.
"And in
an hour Zossimov himself will report to you about everything."
"He is not
drunk!"
And I shan’t be drunk.... And what made me get so tight?
"Because
they got me into an argument, damn them!"
I’ve sworn never to argue!
"They
talk such trash!"
I almost came to blows!
I’ve left my uncle to preside.
"Would you believe, they insist on complete absence of individualism
and that’s just what they relish!"
"Not to be themselves, to be as unlike
themselves as they can."
"That’s what they regard as the highest point of
progress."
"If only their nonsense were their own, but as it is...”

“Listen!” Pulcheria Alexandrovna interrupted timidly, but it only added
fuel to the flames."
"“What do you think?” shouted Razumihin, louder than ever, “you think I
am attacking them for talking nonsense?"
Not a bit!
"I like them to talk
nonsense."
That’s man’s one privilege over all creation.
"Through error
you come to the truth!"
I am a man because I err!
"You never reach any
truth without making fourteen mistakes and very likely a hundred and
fourteen."
"And a fine thing, too, in its way; but we can’t even make
mistakes on our own account!"
"Talk nonsense, but talk your own nonsense,
and I’ll kiss you for it."
"To go wrong in one’s own way is better than
to go right in someone else’s."
"In the first case you are a man, in the
second you’re no better than a bird."
"Truth won’t escape you, but life
can be cramped."
There have been examples.
And what are we doing now?
"In science, development, thought, invention, ideals, aims, liberalism,
judgment, experience and everything, everything, everything, we are
still in the preparatory class at school."
"We prefer to live on other
people’s ideas, it’s what we are used to!"
"Am I right, am I right?” cried
Razumihin, pressing and shaking the two ladies’ hands."
"“Oh, mercy, I do not know,” cried poor Pulcheria Alexandrovna."
"“Yes, yes... though I don’t agree with you in everything,” added Avdotya
Romanovna earnestly and at once uttered a cry, for he squeezed her hand
so painfully."
"“Yes, you say yes... well after that you... you...” he cried in
a transport, “you are a fount of goodness, purity, sense... and
perfection."
"Give me your hand... you give me yours, too!"
"I want to kiss
your hands here at once, on my knees...” and he fell on his knees on the
pavement, fortunately at that time deserted."
"“Leave off, I entreat you, what are you doing?” Pulcheria Alexandrovna
cried, greatly distressed."
"“Get up, get up!” said Dounia laughing, though she, too, was upset."
“Not for anything till you let me kiss your hands!
That’s it!
Enough!
"I
get up and we’ll go on!"
"I am a luckless fool, I am unworthy of you and
drunk... and I am ashamed...."
"I am not worthy to love you, but to do
homage to you is the duty of every man who is not a perfect beast!"
"And
I’ve done homage...."
"Here are your lodgings, and for that alone Rodya
was right in driving your Pyotr Petrovitch away.... How dare he!"
"how
dare he put you in such lodgings!"
It’s a scandal!
"Do you know the
sort of people they take in here?"
And you his betrothed!
"You are
his betrothed?"
Yes?
"Well, then, I’ll tell you, your _fiancé_ is a
scoundrel.”

“Excuse me, Mr. Razumihin, you are forgetting...” Pulcheria Alexandrovna
was beginning."
"“Yes, yes, you are right, I did forget myself, I am ashamed of it,”
 Razumihin made haste to apologise."
"“But... but you can’t be angry with
me for speaking so!"
"For I speak sincerely and not because... hm, hm!"
That would be disgraceful; in fact not because I’m in... hm!
"Well,
anyway, I won’t say why, I daren’t...."
"But we all saw to-day when he
came in that that man is not of our sort."
"Not because he had his hair
curled at the barber’s, not because he was in such a hurry to show his
wit, but because he is a spy, a speculator, because he is a skin-flint
and a buffoon."
That’s evident.
Do you think him clever?
"No, he is a
fool, a fool."
And is he a match for you?
Good heavens!
"Do you see,
ladies?” he stopped suddenly on the way upstairs to their rooms, “though
all my friends there are drunk, yet they are all honest, and though we
do talk a lot of trash, and I do, too, yet we shall talk our way to the
truth at last, for we are on the right path, while Pyotr Petrovitch...
is not on the right path."
"Though I’ve been calling them all sorts of
names just now, I do respect them all... though I don’t respect Zametov,
I like him, for he is a puppy, and that bullock Zossimov, because he
is an honest man and knows his work."
"But enough, it’s all said and
forgiven."
Is it forgiven?
"Well, then, let’s go on."
"I know this corridor,
I’ve been here, there was a scandal here at Number 3.... Where are you
here?"
Which number?
eight?
"Well, lock yourselves in for the night, then."
Don’t let anybody in.
"In a quarter of an hour I’ll come back with news,
and half an hour later I’ll bring Zossimov, you’ll see!"
"Good-bye, I’ll
run.”

“Good heavens, Dounia, what is going to happen?” said Pulcheria
Alexandrovna, addressing her daughter with anxiety and dismay."
"“Don’t worry yourself, mother,” said Dounia, taking off her hat and
cape."
"“God has sent this gentleman to our aid, though he has come from a
drinking party."
"We can depend on him, I assure you."
"And all that he has
done for Rodya....”

“Ah."
"Dounia, goodness knows whether he will come!"
"How could I bring
myself to leave Rodya?..."
"And how different, how different I had fancied
our meeting!"
"How sullen he was, as though not pleased to see us....”

Tears came into her eyes."
"“No, it’s not that, mother."
"You didn’t see, you were crying all the
time."
"He is quite unhinged by serious illness--that’s the reason.”

“Ah, that illness!"
"What will happen, what will happen?"
"And how he talked
to you, Dounia!” said the mother, looking timidly at her daughter,
trying to read her thoughts and, already half consoled by Dounia’s
standing up for her brother, which meant that she had already forgiven
him."
"“I am sure he will think better of it to-morrow,” she added,
probing her further."
"“And I am sure that he will say the same to-morrow... about that,”
 Avdotya Romanovna said finally."
"And, of course, there was no going
beyond that, for this was a point which Pulcheria Alexandrovna was
afraid to discuss."
Dounia went up and kissed her mother.
"The latter
warmly embraced her without speaking."
"Then she sat down to wait
anxiously for Razumihin’s return, timidly watching her daughter who
walked up and down the room with her arms folded, lost in thought."
"This walking up and down when she was thinking was a habit of Avdotya
Romanovna’s and the mother was always afraid to break in on her
daughter’s mood at such moments."
"Razumihin, of course, was ridiculous in his sudden drunken infatuation
for Avdotya Romanovna."
"Yet apart from his eccentric condition, many
people would have thought it justified if they had seen Avdotya
Romanovna, especially at that moment when she was walking to and
fro with folded arms, pensive and melancholy."
"Avdotya Romanovna was
remarkably good-looking; she was tall, strikingly well-proportioned,
strong and self-reliant--the latter quality was apparent in every
gesture, though it did not in the least detract from the grace and
softness of her movements."
"In face she resembled her brother, but she
might be described as really beautiful."
"Her hair was dark brown, a
little lighter than her brother’s; there was a proud light in her almost
black eyes and yet at times a look of extraordinary kindness."
"She was
pale, but it was a healthy pallor; her face was radiant with freshness
and vigour."
"Her mouth was rather small; the full red lower lip projected
a little as did her chin; it was the only irregularity in her beautiful
face, but it gave it a peculiarly individual and almost haughty
expression."
"Her face was always more serious and thoughtful than gay;
but how well smiles, how well youthful, lighthearted, irresponsible,
laughter suited her face!"
"It was natural enough that a warm, open,
simple-hearted, honest giant like Razumihin, who had never seen anyone
like her and was not quite sober at the time, should lose his head
immediately."
"Besides, as chance would have it, he saw Dounia for the
first time transfigured by her love for her brother and her joy at
meeting him."
"Afterwards he saw her lower lip quiver with indignation
at her brother’s insolent, cruel and ungrateful words--and his fate was
sealed."
"He had spoken the truth, moreover, when he blurted out in his drunken
talk on the stairs that Praskovya Pavlovna, Raskolnikov’s eccentric
landlady, would be jealous of Pulcheria Alexandrovna as well as of
Avdotya Romanovna on his account."
"Although Pulcheria Alexandrovna was
forty-three, her face still retained traces of her former beauty; she
looked much younger than her age, indeed, which is almost always the
case with women who retain serenity of spirit, sensitiveness and pure
sincere warmth of heart to old age."
"We may add in parenthesis that to
preserve all this is the only means of retaining beauty to old age."
"Her
hair had begun to grow grey and thin, there had long been little crow’s
foot wrinkles round her eyes, her cheeks were hollow and sunken from
anxiety and grief, and yet it was a handsome face."
"She was Dounia
over again, twenty years older, but without the projecting underlip."
"Pulcheria Alexandrovna was emotional, but not sentimental, timid and
yielding, but only to a certain point."
"She could give way and accept a
great deal even of what was contrary to her convictions, but there was a
certain barrier fixed by honesty, principle and the deepest convictions
which nothing would induce her to cross."
"Exactly twenty minutes after Razumihin’s departure, there came two
subdued but hurried knocks at the door: he had come back."
"“I won’t come in, I haven’t time,” he hastened to say when the door was
opened."
"“He sleeps like a top, soundly, quietly, and God grant he may
sleep ten hours."
"Nastasya’s with him; I told her not to leave till I
came."
"Now I am fetching Zossimov, he will report to you and then you’d
better turn in; I can see you are too tired to do anything....”

And he ran off down the corridor."
"“What a very competent and... devoted young man!” cried Pulcheria
Alexandrovna exceedingly delighted."
"“He seems a splendid person!” Avdotya Romanovna replied with some
warmth, resuming her walk up and down the room."
"It was nearly an hour later when they heard footsteps in the corridor
and another knock at the door."
"Both women waited this time completely
relying on Razumihin’s promise; he actually had succeeded in bringing
Zossimov."
"Zossimov had agreed at once to desert the drinking party to
go to Raskolnikov’s, but he came reluctantly and with the greatest
suspicion to see the ladies, mistrusting Razumihin in his exhilarated
condition."
"But his vanity was at once reassured and flattered; he saw
that they were really expecting him as an oracle."
"He stayed just ten
minutes and succeeded in completely convincing and comforting Pulcheria
Alexandrovna."
"He spoke with marked sympathy, but with the reserve and
extreme seriousness of a young doctor at an important consultation."
"He did not utter a word on any other subject and did not display the
slightest desire to enter into more personal relations with the two
ladies."
"Remarking at his first entrance the dazzling beauty of Avdotya
Romanovna, he endeavoured not to notice her at all during his visit and
addressed himself solely to Pulcheria Alexandrovna."
"All this gave him
extraordinary inward satisfaction."
"He declared that he thought the
invalid at this moment going on very satisfactorily."
"According to his
observations the patient’s illness was due partly to his unfortunate
material surroundings during the last few months, but it had partly also
a moral origin, “was, so to speak, the product of several material and
moral influences, anxieties, apprehensions, troubles, certain ideas...
and so on.” Noticing stealthily that Avdotya Romanovna was following his
words with close attention, Zossimov allowed himself to enlarge on this
theme."
"On Pulcheria Alexandrovna’s anxiously and timidly inquiring as
to “some suspicion of insanity,” he replied with a composed and candid
smile that his words had been exaggerated; that certainly the patient
had some fixed idea, something approaching a monomania--he, Zossimov,
was now particularly studying this interesting branch of medicine--but
that it must be recollected that until to-day the patient had been in
delirium and... and that no doubt the presence of his family would have
a favourable effect on his recovery and distract his mind, “if only all
fresh shocks can be avoided,” he added significantly."
"Then he got up,
took leave with an impressive and affable bow, while blessings, warm
gratitude, and entreaties were showered upon him, and Avdotya Romanovna
spontaneously offered her hand to him."
"He went out exceedingly pleased
with his visit and still more so with himself."
"“We’ll talk to-morrow; go to bed at once!” Razumihin said in conclusion,
following Zossimov out."
"“I’ll be with you to-morrow morning as early as
possible with my report.”

“That’s a fetching little girl, Avdotya Romanovna,” remarked Zossimov,
almost licking his lips as they both came out into the street."
“Fetching?
"You said fetching?” roared Razumihin and he flew at Zossimov
and seized him by the throat."
“If you ever dare.... Do you understand?
"Do you understand?” he shouted, shaking him by the collar and squeezing
him against the wall."
"“Do you hear?”

“Let me go, you drunken devil,” said Zossimov, struggling and when he
had let him go, he stared at him and went off into a sudden guffaw."
Razumihin stood facing him in gloomy and earnest reflection.
"“Of course, I am an ass,” he observed, sombre as a storm cloud, “but
still... you are another.”

“No, brother, not at all such another."
"I am not dreaming of any folly.”

They walked along in silence and only when they were close to
Raskolnikov’s lodgings, Razumihin broke the silence in considerable
anxiety."
"“Listen,” he said, “you’re a first-rate fellow, but among your other
failings, you’re a loose fish, that I know, and a dirty one, too."
"You
are a feeble, nervous wretch, and a mass of whims, you’re getting fat
and lazy and can’t deny yourself anything--and I call that dirty because
it leads one straight into the dirt."
"You’ve let yourself get so slack
that I don’t know how it is you are still a good, even a devoted doctor."
"You--a doctor--sleep on a feather bed and get up at night to your
patients!"
"In another three or four years you won’t get up for your
patients..."
"But hang it all, that’s not the point!..."
"You are going
to spend to-night in the landlady’s flat here."
"(Hard work I’ve had to
persuade her!)"
And I’ll be in the kitchen.
"So here’s a chance for you to
get to know her better.... It’s not as you think!"
"There’s not a trace of
anything of the sort, brother...!”

“But I don’t think!”

“Here you have modesty, brother, silence, bashfulness, a savage
virtue... and yet she’s sighing and melting like wax, simply melting!"
"Save me from her, by all that’s unholy!"
"She’s most prepossessing... I’ll
repay you, I’ll do anything....”

Zossimov laughed more violently than ever."
"“Well, you are smitten!"
"But what am I to do with her?”

“It won’t be much trouble, I assure you."
"Talk any rot you like to her,
as long as you sit by her and talk."
"You’re a doctor, too; try curing
her of something."
I swear you won’t regret it.
"She has a piano, and you
know, I strum a little."
"I have a song there, a genuine Russian one: ‘I
shed hot tears.’ She likes the genuine article--and well, it all
began with that song; Now you’re a regular performer, a _maître_, a
Rubinstein...."
"I assure you, you won’t regret it!”

“But have you made her some promise?"
Something signed?
"A promise of
marriage, perhaps?”

“Nothing, nothing, absolutely nothing of the kind!"
"Besides she is not
that sort at all.... Tchebarov tried that....”

“Well then, drop her!”

“But I can’t drop her like that!”

“Why can’t you?”

“Well, I can’t, that’s all about it!"
"There’s an element of attraction
here, brother.”

“Then why have you fascinated her?”

“I haven’t fascinated her; perhaps I was fascinated myself in my folly."
"But she won’t care a straw whether it’s you or I, so long as somebody
sits beside her, sighing...."
"I can’t explain the position, brother...
look here, you are good at mathematics, and working at it now... begin
teaching her the integral calculus; upon my soul, I’m not joking, I’m
in earnest, it’ll be just the same to her."
"She will gaze at you and sigh
for a whole year together."
"I talked to her once for two days at a time
about the Prussian House of Lords (for one must talk of something)--she
just sighed and perspired!"
"And you mustn’t talk of love--she’s bashful
to hysterics--but just let her see you can’t tear yourself away--that’s
enough."
"It’s fearfully comfortable; you’re quite at home, you can
read, sit, lie about, write."
"You may even venture on a kiss, if you’re
careful.”

“But what do I want with her?”

“Ach, I can’t make you understand!"
"You see, you are made for each other!"
I have often been reminded of you!...
You’ll come to it in the end!
"So
does it matter whether it’s sooner or later?"
"There’s the feather-bed
element here, brother--ach!"
and not only that!
"There’s an attraction
here--here you have the end of the world, an anchorage, a quiet haven,
the navel of the earth, the three fishes that are the foundation of the
world, the essence of pancakes, of savoury fish-pies, of the evening
samovar, of soft sighs and warm shawls, and hot stoves to sleep on--as
snug as though you were dead, and yet you’re alive--the advantages
of both at once!"
"Well, hang it, brother, what stuff I’m talking, it’s
bedtime!"
Listen.
"I sometimes wake up at night; so I’ll go in and look at
him."
"But there’s no need, it’s all right."
"Don’t you worry yourself,
yet if you like, you might just look in once, too."
"But if you notice
anything--delirium or fever--wake me at once."
"But there can’t be....”



CHAPTER II

Razumihin waked up next morning at eight o’clock, troubled and serious."
He found himself confronted with many new and unlooked-for perplexities.
He had never expected that he would ever wake up feeling like that.
"He
remembered every detail of the previous day and he knew that a perfectly
novel experience had befallen him, that he had received an impression
unlike anything he had known before."
"At the same time he recognised
clearly that the dream which had fired his imagination was hopelessly
unattainable--so unattainable that he felt positively ashamed of it, and
he hastened to pass to the other more practical cares and difficulties
bequeathed him by that “thrice accursed yesterday.”

The most awful recollection of the previous day was the way he had shown
himself “base and mean,” not only because he had been drunk, but
because he had taken advantage of the young girl’s position to abuse
her _fiancé_ in his stupid jealousy, knowing nothing of their mutual
relations and obligations and next to nothing of the man himself."
"And
what right had he to criticise him in that hasty and unguarded manner?"
Who had asked for his opinion?
"Was it thinkable that such a creature as
Avdotya Romanovna would be marrying an unworthy man for money?"
"So there
must be something in him."
The lodgings?
"But after all how could he know
the character of the lodgings?"
He was furnishing a flat... Foo!
"how
despicable it all was!"
And what justification was it that he was drunk?
Such a stupid excuse was even more degrading!
"In wine is truth, and the
truth had all come out, “that is, all the uncleanness of his coarse
and envious heart”!"
"And would such a dream ever be permissible to
him, Razumihin?"
"What was he beside such a girl--he, the drunken noisy
braggart of last night?"
"Was it possible to imagine so absurd and cynical
a juxtaposition?"
"Razumihin blushed desperately at the very idea and
suddenly the recollection forced itself vividly upon him of how he had
said last night on the stairs that the landlady would be jealous of
Avdotya Romanovna... that was simply intolerable."
"He brought his fist
down heavily on the kitchen stove, hurt his hand and sent one of the
bricks flying."
"“Of course,” he muttered to himself a minute later with a feeling of
self-abasement, “of course, all these infamies can never be wiped out or
smoothed over... and so it’s useless even to think of it, and I must
go to them in silence and do my duty... in silence, too... and not ask
forgiveness, and say nothing... for all is lost now!”

And yet as he dressed he examined his attire more carefully than usual."
"He hadn’t another suit--if he had had, perhaps he wouldn’t have put it
on."
"“I would have made a point of not putting it on.” But in any case he
could not remain a cynic and a dirty sloven; he had no right to offend
the feelings of others, especially when they were in need of his
assistance and asking him to see them."
He brushed his clothes carefully.
His linen was always decent; in that respect he was especially clean.
"He washed that morning scrupulously--he got some soap from Nastasya--he
washed his hair, his neck and especially his hands."
"When it came to the
question whether to shave his stubbly chin or not (Praskovya Pavlovna
had capital razors that had been left by her late husband), the question
was angrily answered in the negative."
“Let it stay as it is!
"What if
they think that I shaved on purpose to...?"
"They certainly would think
so!"
"Not on any account!”

“And... the worst of it was he was so coarse, so dirty, he had the
manners of a pothouse; and... and even admitting that he knew he had
some of the essentials of a gentleman... what was there in that to be
proud of?"
"Everyone ought to be a gentleman and more than that... and all
the same (he remembered) he, too, had done little things... not exactly
dishonest, and yet.... And what thoughts he sometimes had; hm... and to
set all that beside Avdotya Romanovna!"
Confound it!
So be it!
"Well, he’d
make a point then of being dirty, greasy, pothouse in his manners and he
wouldn’t care!"
"He’d be worse!”

He was engaged in such monologues when Zossimov, who had spent the night
in Praskovya Pavlovna’s parlour, came in."
He was going home and was in a hurry to look at the invalid first.
Razumihin informed him that Raskolnikov was sleeping like a dormouse.
"Zossimov gave orders that they shouldn’t wake him and promised to see
him again about eleven."
"“If he is still at home,” he added."
“Damn it all!
"If one can’t control
one’s patients, how is one to cure them?"
"Do you know whether _he_ will
go to them, or whether _they_ are coming here?”

“They are coming, I think,” said Razumihin, understanding the object
of the question, “and they will discuss their family affairs, no doubt."
I’ll be off.
"You, as the doctor, have more right to be here than I.”

“But I am not a father confessor; I shall come and go away; I’ve plenty
to do besides looking after them.”

“One thing worries me,” interposed Razumihin, frowning."
"“On the way home
I talked a lot of drunken nonsense to him... all sorts of things... and
amongst them that you were afraid that he... might become insane.”

“You told the ladies so, too.”

“I know it was stupid!"
You may beat me if you like!
"Did you think so
seriously?”

“That’s nonsense, I tell you, how could I think it seriously?"
"You,
yourself, described him as a monomaniac when you fetched me to
him... and we added fuel to the fire yesterday, you did, that is, with
your story about the painter; it was a nice conversation, when he was,
perhaps, mad on that very point!"
"If only I’d known what happened then
at the police station and that some wretch... had insulted him with this
suspicion!"
Hm...
I would not have allowed that conversation yesterday.
"These monomaniacs will make a mountain out of a mole-hill... and
see their fancies as solid realities.... As far as I remember, it was
Zametov’s story that cleared up half the mystery, to my mind."
"Why, I
know one case in which a hypochondriac, a man of forty, cut the throat
of a little boy of eight, because he couldn’t endure the jokes he made
every day at table!"
"And in this case his rags, the insolent police
officer, the fever and this suspicion!"
"All that working upon a man half
frantic with hypochondria, and with his morbid exceptional vanity!"
"That
may well have been the starting-point of illness."
"Well, bother it
all!..."
"And, by the way, that Zametov certainly is a nice fellow, but
hm... he shouldn’t have told all that last night."
"He is an awful
chatterbox!”

“But whom did he tell it to?"
"You and me?”

“And Porfiry.”

“What does that matter?”

“And, by the way, have you any influence on them, his mother and sister?"
"Tell them to be more careful with him to-day....”

“They’ll get on all right!” Razumihin answered reluctantly."
“Why is he so set against this Luzhin?
"A man with money and she doesn’t
seem to dislike him... and they haven’t a farthing, I suppose?"
"eh?”

“But what business is it of yours?” Razumihin cried with annoyance."
"“How
can I tell whether they’ve a farthing?"
"Ask them yourself and perhaps
you’ll find out....”

“Foo!"
what an ass you are sometimes!
"Last night’s wine has not gone off
yet.... Good-bye; thank your Praskovya Pavlovna from me for my night’s
lodging."
"She locked herself in, made no reply to my _bonjour_ through
the door; she was up at seven o’clock, the samovar was taken into her
from the kitchen."
"I was not vouchsafed a personal interview....”

At nine o’clock precisely Razumihin reached the lodgings at Bakaleyev’s
house."
Both ladies were waiting for him with nervous impatience.
"They
had risen at seven o’clock or earlier."
"He entered looking as black as
night, bowed awkwardly and was at once furious with himself for it."
"He
had reckoned without his host: Pulcheria Alexandrovna fairly rushed at
him, seized him by both hands and was almost kissing them."
"He glanced
timidly at Avdotya Romanovna, but her proud countenance wore at that
moment an expression of such gratitude and friendliness, such
complete and unlooked-for respect (in place of the sneering looks and
ill-disguised contempt he had expected), that it threw him into greater
confusion than if he had been met with abuse."
"Fortunately there was a
subject for conversation, and he made haste to snatch at it."
"Hearing that everything was going well and that Rodya had not yet waked,
Pulcheria Alexandrovna declared that she was glad to hear it, because
“she had something which it was very, very necessary to talk over
beforehand.” Then followed an inquiry about breakfast and an invitation
to have it with them; they had waited to have it with him."
"Avdotya
Romanovna rang the bell: it was answered by a ragged dirty waiter, and
they asked him to bring tea which was served at last, but in such
a dirty and disorderly way that the ladies were ashamed."
"Razumihin
vigorously attacked the lodgings, but, remembering Luzhin, stopped
in embarrassment and was greatly relieved by Pulcheria Alexandrovna’s
questions, which showered in a continual stream upon him."
"He talked for three quarters of an hour, being constantly interrupted
by their questions, and succeeded in describing to them all the
most important facts he knew of the last year of Raskolnikov’s life,
concluding with a circumstantial account of his illness."
"He omitted,
however, many things, which were better omitted, including the scene at
the police station with all its consequences."
"They listened eagerly
to his story, and, when he thought he had finished and satisfied his
listeners, he found that they considered he had hardly begun."
"“Tell me, tell me!"
What do you think...?
"Excuse me, I still don’t know
your name!” Pulcheria Alexandrovna put in hastily."
"“Dmitri Prokofitch.”

“I should like very, very much to know, Dmitri Prokofitch... how he
looks... on things in general now, that is, how can I explain, what are
his likes and dislikes?"
Is he always so irritable?
"Tell me, if you can,
what are his hopes and, so to say, his dreams?"
"Under what influences is
he now?"
"In a word, I should like...”

“Ah, mother, how can he answer all that at once?” observed Dounia."
"“Good heavens, I had not expected to find him in the least like this,
Dmitri Prokofitch!”

“Naturally,” answered Razumihin."
"“I have no mother, but my uncle comes
every year and almost every time he can scarcely recognise me, even in
appearance, though he is a clever man; and your three years’ separation
means a great deal."
What am I to tell you?
"I have known Rodion for
a year and a half; he is morose, gloomy, proud and haughty, and of
late--and perhaps for a long time before--he has been suspicious and
fanciful."
He has a noble nature and a kind heart.
"He does not like
showing his feelings and would rather do a cruel thing than open his
heart freely."
"Sometimes, though, he is not at all morbid, but simply
cold and inhumanly callous; it’s as though he were alternating between
two characters."
Sometimes he is fearfully reserved!
"He says he is
so busy that everything is a hindrance, and yet he lies in bed doing
nothing."
"He doesn’t jeer at things, not because he hasn’t the wit, but
as though he hadn’t time to waste on such trifles."
"He never listens
to what is said to him."
"He is never interested in what interests other
people at any given moment."
"He thinks very highly of himself and perhaps
he is right."
"Well, what more?"
"I think your arrival will have a most
beneficial influence upon him.”

“God grant it may,” cried Pulcheria Alexandrovna, distressed by
Razumihin’s account of her Rodya."
And Razumihin ventured to look more boldly at Avdotya Romanovna at last.
"He glanced at her often while he was talking, but only for a moment and
looked away again at once."
"Avdotya Romanovna sat at the table, listening
attentively, then got up again and began walking to and fro with her
arms folded and her lips compressed, occasionally putting in a question,
without stopping her walk."
"She had the same habit of not listening to
what was said."
"She was wearing a dress of thin dark stuff and she had a
white transparent scarf round her neck."
"Razumihin soon detected signs of
extreme poverty in their belongings."
"Had Avdotya Romanovna been dressed
like a queen, he felt that he would not be afraid of her, but perhaps
just because she was poorly dressed and that he noticed all the misery
of her surroundings, his heart was filled with dread and he began to be
afraid of every word he uttered, every gesture he made, which was very
trying for a man who already felt diffident."
"“You’ve told us a great deal that is interesting about my brother’s
character... and have told it impartially."
I am glad.
"I thought that you
were too uncritically devoted to him,” observed Avdotya Romanovna with
a smile."
"“I think you are right that he needs a woman’s care,” she added
thoughtfully."
"“I didn’t say so; but I daresay you are right, only...”

“What?”

“He loves no one and perhaps he never will,” Razumihin declared
decisively."
"“You mean he is not capable of love?”

“Do you know, Avdotya Romanovna, you are awfully like your brother, in
everything, indeed!” he blurted out suddenly to his own surprise, but
remembering at once what he had just before said of her brother,
he turned as red as a crab and was overcome with confusion."
"Avdotya
Romanovna couldn’t help laughing when she looked at him."
"“You may both be mistaken about Rodya,” Pulcheria Alexandrovna remarked,
slightly piqued."
"“I am not talking of our present difficulty, Dounia."
"What Pyotr Petrovitch writes in this letter and what you and I have
supposed may be mistaken, but you can’t imagine, Dmitri Prokofitch, how
moody and, so to say, capricious he is."
"I never could depend on what
he would do when he was only fifteen."
"And I am sure that he might
do something now that nobody else would think of doing... Well, for
instance, do you know how a year and a half ago he astounded me and gave
me a shock that nearly killed me, when he had the idea of marrying that
girl--what was her name--his landlady’s daughter?”

“Did you hear about that affair?” asked Avdotya Romanovna."
“Do you suppose----” Pulcheria Alexandrovna continued warmly.
"“Do you
suppose that my tears, my entreaties, my illness, my possible death from
grief, our poverty would have made him pause?"
"No, he would calmly have
disregarded all obstacles."
"And yet it isn’t that he doesn’t love us!”

“He has never spoken a word of that affair to me,” Razumihin answered
cautiously."
"“But I did hear something from Praskovya Pavlovna herself,
though she is by no means a gossip."
"And what I heard certainly was
rather strange.”

“And what did you hear?” both the ladies asked at once."
"“Well, nothing very special."
"I only learned that the marriage, which
only failed to take place through the girl’s death, was not at all to
Praskovya Pavlovna’s liking."
"They say, too, the girl was not at all
pretty, in fact I am told positively ugly... and such an invalid... and
queer."
But she seems to have had some good qualities.
"She must have
had some good qualities or it’s quite inexplicable.... She had no money
either and he wouldn’t have considered her money...."
"But it’s always
difficult to judge in such matters.”

“I am sure she was a good girl,” Avdotya Romanovna observed briefly."
"“God forgive me, I simply rejoiced at her death."
"Though I don’t know
which of them would have caused most misery to the other--he to her
or she to him,” Pulcheria Alexandrovna concluded."
"Then she began
tentatively questioning him about the scene on the previous day with
Luzhin, hesitating and continually glancing at Dounia, obviously to
the latter’s annoyance."
"This incident more than all the rest evidently
caused her uneasiness, even consternation."
"Razumihin described it in
detail again, but this time he added his own conclusions: he openly
blamed Raskolnikov for intentionally insulting Pyotr Petrovitch, not
seeking to excuse him on the score of his illness."
"“He had planned it before his illness,” he added."
"“I think so, too,” Pulcheria Alexandrovna agreed with a dejected air."
"But she was very much surprised at hearing Razumihin express himself
so carefully and even with a certain respect about Pyotr Petrovitch."
"Avdotya Romanovna, too, was struck by it."
"“So this is your opinion of Pyotr Petrovitch?” Pulcheria Alexandrovna
could not resist asking."
"“I can have no other opinion of your daughter’s future husband,”
 Razumihin answered firmly and with warmth, “and I don’t say it simply
from vulgar politeness, but because... simply because Avdotya Romanovna
has of her own free will deigned to accept this man."
"If I spoke so
rudely of him last night, it was because I was disgustingly drunk and...
mad besides; yes, mad, crazy, I lost my head completely... and this
morning I am ashamed of it.”

He crimsoned and ceased speaking."
"Avdotya Romanovna flushed, but did not
break the silence."
"She had not uttered a word from the moment they began
to speak of Luzhin."
"Without her support Pulcheria Alexandrovna obviously did not know what
to do."
"At last, faltering and continually glancing at her daughter, she
confessed that she was exceedingly worried by one circumstance."
"“You see, Dmitri Prokofitch,” she began."
"“I’ll be perfectly open with
Dmitri Prokofitch, Dounia?”

“Of course, mother,” said Avdotya Romanovna emphatically."
"“This is what it is,” she began in haste, as though the permission to
speak of her trouble lifted a weight off her mind."
"“Very early this
morning we got a note from Pyotr Petrovitch in reply to our letter
announcing our arrival."
"He promised to meet us at the station, you
know; instead of that he sent a servant to bring us the address of these
lodgings and to show us the way; and he sent a message that he would
be here himself this morning."
But this morning this note came from him.
"You’d better read it yourself; there is one point in it which worries me
very much... you will soon see what that is, and... tell me your candid
opinion, Dmitri Prokofitch!"
"You know Rodya’s character better than
anyone and no one can advise us better than you can."
"Dounia, I must tell
you, made her decision at once, but I still don’t feel sure how to act
and I... I’ve been waiting for your opinion.”

Razumihin opened the note which was dated the previous evening and read
as follows:

“Dear Madam, Pulcheria Alexandrovna, I have the honour to inform you
that owing to unforeseen obstacles I was rendered unable to meet you at
the railway station; I sent a very competent person with the same object
in view."
"I likewise shall be deprived of the honour of an interview with
you to-morrow morning by business in the Senate that does not admit of
delay, and also that I may not intrude on your family circle while you
are meeting your son, and Avdotya Romanovna her brother."
"I shall have
the honour of visiting you and paying you my respects at your lodgings
not later than to-morrow evening at eight o’clock precisely, and
herewith I venture to present my earnest and, I may add, imperative
request that Rodion Romanovitch may not be present at our interview--as
he offered me a gross and unprecedented affront on the occasion of my
visit to him in his illness yesterday, and, moreover, since I desire
from you personally an indispensable and circumstantial explanation
upon a certain point, in regard to which I wish to learn your own
interpretation."
"I have the honour to inform you, in anticipation,
that if, in spite of my request, I meet Rodion Romanovitch, I shall be
compelled to withdraw immediately and then you have only yourself to
blame."
"I write on the assumption that Rodion Romanovitch who appeared so
ill at my visit, suddenly recovered two hours later and so, being able
to leave the house, may visit you also."
"I was confirmed in that belief
by the testimony of my own eyes in the lodging of a drunken man who
was run over and has since died, to whose daughter, a young woman of
notorious behaviour, he gave twenty-five roubles on the pretext of the
funeral, which gravely surprised me knowing what pains you were at to
raise that sum."
"Herewith expressing my special respect to your estimable
daughter, Avdotya Romanovna, I beg you to accept the respectful homage
of

“Your humble servant,

“P."
"LUZHIN.”


“What am I to do now, Dmitri Prokofitch?” began Pulcheria Alexandrovna,
almost weeping."
“How can I ask Rodya not to come?
"Yesterday he insisted
so earnestly on our refusing Pyotr Petrovitch and now we are ordered not
to receive Rodya!"
"He will come on purpose if he knows, and... what will
happen then?”

“Act on Avdotya Romanovna’s decision,” Razumihin answered calmly at
once."
"“Oh, dear me!"
"She says... goodness knows what she says, she doesn’t
explain her object!"
"She says that it would be best, at least, not that
it would be best, but that it’s absolutely necessary that Rodya should
make a point of being here at eight o’clock and that they must meet...."
"I didn’t want even to show him the letter, but to prevent him
from coming by some stratagem with your help... because he is so
irritable...."
"Besides I don’t understand about that drunkard who died
and that daughter, and how he could have given the daughter all the
money... which...”

“Which cost you such sacrifice, mother,” put in Avdotya Romanovna."
"“He was not himself yesterday,” Razumihin said thoughtfully, “if you
only knew what he was up to in a restaurant yesterday, though there
was sense in it too.... Hm!"
"He did say something, as we were going home
yesterday evening, about a dead man and a girl, but I didn’t understand
a word...."
"But last night, I myself...”

“The best thing, mother, will be for us to go to him ourselves and
there I assure you we shall see at once what’s to be done."
"Besides,
it’s getting late--good heavens, it’s past ten,” she cried looking at
a splendid gold enamelled watch which hung round her neck on a thin
Venetian chain, and looked entirely out of keeping with the rest of her
dress."
"“A present from her _fiancé_,” thought Razumihin."
"“We must start, Dounia, we must start,” her mother cried in a flutter."
"“He will be thinking we are still angry after yesterday, from our coming
so late."
"Merciful heavens!”

While she said this she was hurriedly putting on her hat and mantle;
Dounia, too, put on her things."
"Her gloves, as Razumihin noticed, were
not merely shabby but had holes in them, and yet this evident poverty
gave the two ladies an air of special dignity, which is always found in
people who know how to wear poor clothes."
"Razumihin looked reverently
at Dounia and felt proud of escorting her."
"“The queen who mended her
stockings in prison,” he thought, “must have looked then every inch a
queen and even more a queen than at sumptuous banquets and levées.”

“My God!” exclaimed Pulcheria Alexandrovna, “little did I think that I
should ever fear seeing my son, my darling, darling Rodya!"
"I am afraid,
Dmitri Prokofitch,” she added, glancing at him timidly."
"“Don’t be afraid, mother,” said Dounia, kissing her, “better have faith
in him.”

“Oh, dear, I have faith in him, but I haven’t slept all night,”
 exclaimed the poor woman."
They came out into the street.
"“Do you know, Dounia, when I dozed a little this morning I dreamed of
Marfa Petrovna... she was all in white... she came up to me, took
my hand, and shook her head at me, but so sternly as though she were
blaming me.... Is that a good omen?"
"Oh, dear me!"
"You don’t know, Dmitri
Prokofitch, that Marfa Petrovna’s dead!”

“No, I didn’t know; who is Marfa Petrovna?”

“She died suddenly; and only fancy...”

“Afterwards, mamma,” put in Dounia."
"“He doesn’t know who Marfa Petrovna
is.”

“Ah, you don’t know?"
And I was thinking that you knew all about us.
"Forgive me, Dmitri Prokofitch, I don’t know what I am thinking about
these last few days."
"I look upon you really as a providence for us, and
so I took it for granted that you knew all about us."
"I look on you as a
relation.... Don’t be angry with me for saying so."
"Dear me, what’s the
matter with your right hand?"
"Have you knocked it?”

“Yes, I bruised it,” muttered Razumihin overjoyed."
"“I sometimes speak too much from the heart, so that Dounia finds fault
with me...."
"But, dear me, what a cupboard he lives in!"
"I wonder whether
he is awake?"
"Does this woman, his landlady, consider it a room?"
"Listen,
you say he does not like to show his feelings, so perhaps I shall annoy
him with my... weaknesses?"
"Do advise me, Dmitri Prokofitch, how am I to
treat him?"
"I feel quite distracted, you know.”

“Don’t question him too much about anything if you see him frown; don’t
ask him too much about his health; he doesn’t like that.”

“Ah, Dmitri Prokofitch, how hard it is to be a mother!"
"But here are the
stairs.... What an awful staircase!”

“Mother, you are quite pale, don’t distress yourself, darling,” said
Dounia caressing her, then with flashing eyes she added: “He ought to be
happy at seeing you, and you are tormenting yourself so.”

“Wait, I’ll peep in and see whether he has waked up.”

The ladies slowly followed Razumihin, who went on before, and when they
reached the landlady’s door on the fourth storey, they noticed that her
door was a tiny crack open and that two keen black eyes were watching
them from the darkness within."
"When their eyes met, the door was
suddenly shut with such a slam that Pulcheria Alexandrovna almost cried
out."
"CHAPTER III

“He is well, quite well!” Zossimov cried cheerfully as they entered."
"He had come in ten minutes earlier and was sitting in the same place
as before, on the sofa."
"Raskolnikov was sitting in the opposite corner,
fully dressed and carefully washed and combed, as he had not been for
some time past."
"The room was immediately crowded, yet Nastasya managed
to follow the visitors in and stayed to listen."
"Raskolnikov really was almost well, as compared with his condition the
day before, but he was still pale, listless, and sombre."
"He looked like
a wounded man or one who has undergone some terrible physical suffering."
"His brows were knitted, his lips compressed, his eyes feverish."
"He spoke
little and reluctantly, as though performing a duty, and there was a
restlessness in his movements."
"He only wanted a sling on his arm or a bandage on his finger to complete
the impression of a man with a painful abscess or a broken arm."
"The
pale, sombre face lighted up for a moment when his mother and sister
entered, but this only gave it a look of more intense suffering, in
place of its listless dejection."
"The light soon died away, but the look
of suffering remained, and Zossimov, watching and studying his patient
with all the zest of a young doctor beginning to practise, noticed
in him no joy at the arrival of his mother and sister, but a sort of
bitter, hidden determination to bear another hour or two of inevitable
torture."
"He saw later that almost every word of the following
conversation seemed to touch on some sore place and irritate it."
"But
at the same time he marvelled at the power of controlling himself
and hiding his feelings in a patient who the previous day had, like a
monomaniac, fallen into a frenzy at the slightest word."
"“Yes, I see myself now that I am almost well,” said Raskolnikov,
giving his mother and sister a kiss of welcome which made Pulcheria
Alexandrovna radiant at once."
"“And I don’t say this _as I did
yesterday_,” he said, addressing Razumihin, with a friendly pressure of
his hand."
"“Yes, indeed, I am quite surprised at him to-day,” began Zossimov, much
delighted at the ladies’ entrance, for he had not succeeded in keeping
up a conversation with his patient for ten minutes."
"“In another three or
four days, if he goes on like this, he will be just as before, that is,
as he was a month ago, or two... or perhaps even three."
"This has been
coming on for a long while.... eh?"
"Confess, now, that it has been
perhaps your own fault?” he added, with a tentative smile, as though
still afraid of irritating him."
"“It is very possible,” answered Raskolnikov coldly."
"“I should say, too,” continued Zossimov with zest, “that your complete
recovery depends solely on yourself."
"Now that one can talk to you,
I should like to impress upon you that it is essential to avoid the
elementary, so to speak, fundamental causes tending to produce your
morbid condition: in that case you will be cured, if not, it will go
from bad to worse."
"These fundamental causes I don’t know, but they must
be known to you."
"You are an intelligent man, and must have observed
yourself, of course."
"I fancy the first stage of your derangement
coincides with your leaving the university."
"You must not be left without
occupation, and so, work and a definite aim set before you might, I
fancy, be very beneficial.”

“Yes, yes; you are perfectly right...."
"I will make haste and return to
the university: and then everything will go smoothly....”

Zossimov, who had begun his sage advice partly to make an effect before
the ladies, was certainly somewhat mystified, when, glancing at his
patient, he observed unmistakable mockery on his face."
"This lasted
an instant, however."
"Pulcheria Alexandrovna began at once thanking
Zossimov, especially for his visit to their lodging the previous night."
“What!
"he saw you last night?” Raskolnikov asked, as though startled."
"“Then you have not slept either after your journey.”

“Ach, Rodya, that was only till two o’clock."
"Dounia and I never go to
bed before two at home.”

“I don’t know how to thank him either,” Raskolnikov went on,
suddenly frowning and looking down."
"“Setting aside the question of
payment--forgive me for referring to it (he turned to Zossimov)--I
really don’t know what I have done to deserve such special attention
from you!"
"I simply don’t understand it... and... and... it weighs upon
me, indeed, because I don’t understand it."
"I tell you so candidly.”

“Don’t be irritated.” Zossimov forced himself to laugh."
"“Assume that you
are my first patient--well--we fellows just beginning to practise love
our first patients as if they were our children, and some almost fall in
love with them."
"And, of course, I am not rich in patients.”

“I say nothing about him,” added Raskolnikov, pointing to Razumihin,
“though he has had nothing from me either but insult and trouble.”

“What nonsense he is talking!"
"Why, you are in a sentimental mood to-day,
are you?” shouted Razumihin."
"If he had had more penetration he would have seen that there was no
trace of sentimentality in him, but something indeed quite the opposite."
But Avdotya Romanovna noticed it.
"She was intently and uneasily watching
her brother."
"“As for you, mother, I don’t dare to speak,” he went on, as though
repeating a lesson learned by heart."
"“It is only to-day that I have
been able to realise a little how distressed you must have been here
yesterday, waiting for me to come back.”

When he had said this, he suddenly held out his hand to his sister,
smiling without a word."
"But in this smile there was a flash of real
unfeigned feeling."
"Dounia caught it at once, and warmly pressed his
hand, overjoyed and thankful."
"It was the first time he had addressed her
since their dispute the previous day."
"The mother’s face lighted up
with ecstatic happiness at the sight of this conclusive unspoken
reconciliation."
"“Yes, that is what I love him for,” Razumihin,
exaggerating it all, muttered to himself, with a vigorous turn in his
chair."
"“He has these movements.”

“And how well he does it all,” the mother was thinking to herself."
"“What
generous impulses he has, and how simply, how delicately he put an end
to all the misunderstanding with his sister--simply by holding out his
hand at the right minute and looking at her like that.... And what
fine eyes he has, and how fine his whole face is!..."
"He is even better
looking than Dounia...."
"But, good heavens, what a suit--how terribly
he’s dressed!..."
"Vasya, the messenger boy in Afanasy Ivanitch’s shop, is
better dressed!"
"I could rush at him and hug him... weep over him--but
I am afraid.... Oh, dear, he’s so strange!"
"He’s talking kindly, but I’m
afraid!"
"Why, what am I afraid of?...”

“Oh, Rodya, you wouldn’t believe,” she began suddenly, in haste to
answer his words to her, “how unhappy Dounia and I were yesterday!"
"Now
that it’s all over and done with and we are quite happy again--I can
tell you."
"Fancy, we ran here almost straight from the train to embrace
you and that woman--ah, here she is!"
"Good morning, Nastasya!..."
"She told
us at once that you were lying in a high fever and had just run away
from the doctor in delirium, and they were looking for you in the
streets."
You can’t imagine how we felt!
"I couldn’t help thinking of the
tragic end of Lieutenant Potanchikov, a friend of your father’s--you
can’t remember him, Rodya--who ran out in the same way in a high fever
and fell into the well in the court-yard and they couldn’t pull him out
till next day."
"Of course, we exaggerated things."
"We were on the point of
rushing to find Pyotr Petrovitch to ask him to help.... Because we were
alone, utterly alone,” she said plaintively and stopped short,
suddenly, recollecting it was still somewhat dangerous to speak of Pyotr
Petrovitch, although “we are quite happy again.”

“Yes, yes.... Of course it’s very annoying....” Raskolnikov muttered in
reply, but with such a preoccupied and inattentive air that Dounia gazed
at him in perplexity."
“What else was it I wanted to say?” He went on trying to recollect.
"“Oh,
yes; mother, and you too, Dounia, please don’t think that I didn’t mean
to come and see you to-day and was waiting for you to come first.”

“What are you saying, Rodya?” cried Pulcheria Alexandrovna."
"She, too,
was surprised."
“Is he answering us as a duty?” Dounia wondered.
"“Is he being reconciled
and asking forgiveness as though he were performing a rite or repeating
a lesson?”

“I’ve only just waked up, and wanted to go to you, but was delayed owing
to my clothes; I forgot yesterday to ask her... Nastasya... to wash out
the blood... I’ve only just dressed.”

“Blood!"
What blood?” Pulcheria Alexandrovna asked in alarm.
"“Oh, nothing--don’t be uneasy."
"It was when I was wandering about
yesterday, rather delirious, I chanced upon a man who had been run
over... a clerk...”

“Delirious?"
But you remember everything!” Razumihin interrupted.
"“That’s true,” Raskolnikov answered with special carefulness."
"“I
remember everything even to the slightest detail, and yet--why I did
that and went there and said that, I can’t clearly explain now.”

“A familiar phenomenon,” interposed Zossimov, “actions are sometimes
performed in a masterly and most cunning way, while the direction of the
actions is deranged and dependent on various morbid impressions--it’s
like a dream.”

“Perhaps it’s a good thing really that he should think me almost a
madman,” thought Raskolnikov."
"“Why, people in perfect health act in the same way too,” observed
Dounia, looking uneasily at Zossimov."
"“There is some truth in your observation,” the latter replied."
"“In that
sense we are certainly all not infrequently like madmen, but with the
slight difference that the deranged are somewhat madder, for we
must draw a line."
"A normal man, it is true, hardly exists."
"Among
dozens--perhaps hundreds of thousands--hardly one is to be met with.”

At the word “madman,” carelessly dropped by Zossimov in his chatter on
his favourite subject, everyone frowned."
"Raskolnikov sat seeming not to pay attention, plunged in thought with a
strange smile on his pale lips."
He was still meditating on something.
"“Well, what about the man who was run over?"
"I interrupted you!”
 Razumihin cried hastily."
“What?” Raskolnikov seemed to wake up.
“Oh...
"I got spattered with
blood helping to carry him to his lodging."
"By the way, mamma, I did an
unpardonable thing yesterday."
I was literally out of my mind.
"I gave
away all the money you sent me... to his wife for the funeral."
"She’s
a widow now, in consumption, a poor creature... three little children,
starving... nothing in the house... there’s a daughter, too... perhaps
you’d have given it yourself if you’d seen them."
"But I had no right to
do it I admit, especially as I knew how you needed the money yourself."
"To help others one must have the right to do it, or else _Crevez,
chiens, si vous n’êtes pas contents_.” He laughed, “That’s right, isn’t
it, Dounia?”

“No, it’s not,” answered Dounia firmly."
“Bah!
"you, too, have ideals,” he muttered, looking at her almost with
hatred, and smiling sarcastically."
"“I ought to have considered that....
Well, that’s praiseworthy, and it’s better for you... and if you reach a
line you won’t overstep, you will be unhappy... and if you overstep it,
maybe you will be still unhappier...."
"But all that’s nonsense,” he added
irritably, vexed at being carried away."
"“I only meant to say that I beg
your forgiveness, mother,” he concluded, shortly and abruptly."
"“That’s enough, Rodya, I am sure that everything you do is very good,”
 said his mother, delighted."
"“Don’t be too sure,” he answered, twisting his mouth into a smile."
A silence followed.
"There was a certain constraint in all this
conversation, and in the silence, and in the reconciliation, and in the
forgiveness, and all were feeling it."
"“It is as though they were afraid of me,” Raskolnikov was thinking
to himself, looking askance at his mother and sister."
"Pulcheria
Alexandrovna was indeed growing more timid the longer she kept silent."
"“Yet in their absence I seemed to love them so much,” flashed through
his mind."
"“Do you know, Rodya, Marfa Petrovna is dead,” Pulcheria Alexandrovna
suddenly blurted out."
"“What Marfa Petrovna?”

“Oh, mercy on us--Marfa Petrovna Svidrigaïlov."
"I wrote you so much about
her.”

“A-a-h!"
"Yes, I remember...."
So she’s dead!
"Oh, really?” he roused
himself suddenly, as if waking up."
"“What did she die of?”

“Only imagine, quite suddenly,” Pulcheria Alexandrovna answered
hurriedly, encouraged by his curiosity."
"“On the very day I was sending
you that letter!"
"Would you believe it, that awful man seems to have been
the cause of her death."
"They say he beat her dreadfully.”

“Why, were they on such bad terms?” he asked, addressing his sister."
“Not at all.
Quite the contrary indeed.
"With her, he was always very
patient, considerate even."
"In fact, all those seven years of their
married life he gave way to her, too much so indeed, in many cases."
"All
of a sudden he seems to have lost patience.”

“Then he could not have been so awful if he controlled himself for seven
years?"
"You seem to be defending him, Dounia?”

“No, no, he’s an awful man!"
"I can imagine nothing more awful!” Dounia
answered, almost with a shudder, knitting her brows, and sinking into
thought."
"“That had happened in the morning,” Pulcheria Alexandrovna went on
hurriedly."
"“And directly afterwards she ordered the horses to be
harnessed to drive to the town immediately after dinner."
"She always used
to drive to the town in such cases."
"She ate a very good dinner, I am
told....”

“After the beating?”

“That was always her... habit; and immediately after dinner, so as not
to be late in starting, she went to the bath-house.... You see, she was
undergoing some treatment with baths."
"They have a cold spring there, and
she used to bathe in it regularly every day, and no sooner had she got
into the water when she suddenly had a stroke!”

“I should think so,” said Zossimov."
"“And did he beat her badly?”

“What does that matter!” put in Dounia."
“H’m!
"But I don’t know why you want to tell us such gossip, mother,”
 said Raskolnikov irritably, as it were in spite of himself."
"“Ah, my dear, I don’t know what to talk about,” broke from Pulcheria
Alexandrovna."
"“Why, are you all afraid of me?” he asked, with a constrained smile."
"“That’s certainly true,” said Dounia, looking directly and sternly at
her brother."
"“Mother was crossing herself with terror as she came up the
stairs.”

His face worked, as though in convulsion."
"“Ach, what are you saying, Dounia!"
"Don’t be angry, please, Rodya....
Why did you say that, Dounia?” Pulcheria Alexandrovna began,
overwhelmed--“You see, coming here, I was dreaming all the way, in the
train, how we should meet, how we should talk over everything
together.... And I was so happy, I did not notice the journey!"
"But what
am I saying?"
"I am happy now.... You should not, Dounia...."
"I am happy
now--simply in seeing you, Rodya....”

“Hush, mother,” he muttered in confusion, not looking at her, but
pressing her hand."
"“We shall have time to speak freely of everything!”

As he said this, he was suddenly overwhelmed with confusion and turned
pale."
"Again that awful sensation he had known of late passed with deadly
chill over his soul."
"Again it became suddenly plain and perceptible to
him that he had just told a fearful lie--that he would never now be
able to speak freely of everything--that he would never again be able to
_speak_ of anything to anyone."
"The anguish of this thought was such that
for a moment he almost forgot himself."
"He got up from his seat, and not
looking at anyone walked towards the door."
"“What are you about?” cried Razumihin, clutching him by the arm."
"He sat down again, and began looking about him, in silence."
"They were
all looking at him in perplexity."
"“But what are you all so dull for?” he shouted, suddenly and quite
unexpectedly."
“Do say something!
What’s the use of sitting like this?
"Come, do speak."
"Let us talk.... We meet together and sit in silence....
Come, anything!”

“Thank God; I was afraid the same thing as yesterday was beginning
again,” said Pulcheria Alexandrovna, crossing herself."
"“What is the matter, Rodya?” asked Avdotya Romanovna, distrustfully."
"“Oh, nothing!"
"I remembered something,” he answered, and suddenly
laughed."
"“Well, if you remembered something; that’s all right!..."
"I was beginning
to think...” muttered Zossimov, getting up from the sofa."
"“It is time
for me to be off."
"I will look in again perhaps... if I can...” He made
his bows, and went out."
“What an excellent man!” observed Pulcheria Alexandrovna.
"“Yes, excellent, splendid, well-educated, intelligent,” Raskolnikov
began, suddenly speaking with surprising rapidity, and a liveliness he
had not shown till then."
"“I can’t remember where I met him before my
illness...."
"I believe I have met him somewhere----... And this is a good
man, too,” he nodded at Razumihin."
"“Do you like him, Dounia?” he asked
her; and suddenly, for some unknown reason, laughed."
"“Very much,” answered Dounia."
"“Foo!--what a pig you are!” Razumihin protested, blushing in terrible
confusion, and he got up from his chair."
"Pulcheria Alexandrovna smiled
faintly, but Raskolnikov laughed aloud."
"“Where are you off to?”

“I must go.”

“You need not at all."
Stay.
"Zossimov has gone, so you must."
Don’t go.
What’s the time?
Is it twelve o’clock?
"What a pretty watch you have got,
Dounia."
But why are you all silent again?
"I do all the talking.”

“It was a present from Marfa Petrovna,” answered Dounia."
“And a very expensive one!” added Pulcheria Alexandrovna.
“A-ah!
What a big one!
"Hardly like a lady’s.”

“I like that sort,” said Dounia."
"“So it is not a present from her _fiancé_,” thought Razumihin, and was
unreasonably delighted."
"“I thought it was Luzhin’s present,” observed Raskolnikov."
"“No, he has not made Dounia any presents yet.”

“A-ah!"
"And do you remember, mother, I was in love and wanted to get
married?” he said suddenly, looking at his mother, who was disconcerted
by the sudden change of subject and the way he spoke of it."
"“Oh, yes, my dear.”

Pulcheria Alexandrovna exchanged glances with Dounia and Razumihin."
"“H’m, yes."
What shall I tell you?
I don’t remember much indeed.
"She was
such a sickly girl,” he went on, growing dreamy and looking down again."
“Quite an invalid.
"She was fond of giving alms to the poor, and was
always dreaming of a nunnery, and once she burst into tears when she
began talking to me about it."
"Yes, yes, I remember."
"I remember very
well."
She was an ugly little thing.
"I really don’t know what drew me
to her then--I think it was because she was always ill."
"If she had been
lame or hunchback, I believe I should have liked her better still,” he
smiled dreamily."
"“Yes, it was a sort of spring delirium.”

“No, it was not only spring delirium,” said Dounia, with warm feeling."
"He fixed a strained intent look on his sister, but did not hear or did
not understand her words."
"Then, completely lost in thought, he got up,
went up to his mother, kissed her, went back to his place and sat down."
"“You love her even now?” said Pulcheria Alexandrovna, touched."
“Her?
Now?
"Oh, yes.... You ask about her?"
"No... that’s all now, as
it were, in another world... and so long ago."
"And indeed everything
happening here seems somehow far away.” He looked attentively at them."
"“You, now..."
"I seem to be looking at you from a thousand miles away...
but, goodness knows why we are talking of that!"
"And what’s the use of
asking about it?” he added with annoyance, and biting his nails, fell
into dreamy silence again."
"“What a wretched lodging you have, Rodya!"
"It’s like a tomb,” said
Pulcheria Alexandrovna, suddenly breaking the oppressive silence."
"“I
am sure it’s quite half through your lodging you have become so
melancholy.”

“My lodging,” he answered, listlessly."
"“Yes, the lodging had a great
deal to do with it...."
"I thought that, too...."
"If only you knew, though,
what a strange thing you said just now, mother,” he said, laughing
strangely."
"A little more, and their companionship, this mother and this sister,
with him after three years’ absence, this intimate tone of conversation,
in face of the utter impossibility of really speaking about anything,
would have been beyond his power of endurance."
"But there was one urgent
matter which must be settled one way or the other that day--so he had
decided when he woke."
"Now he was glad to remember it, as a means of
escape."
"“Listen, Dounia,” he began, gravely and drily, “of course I beg your
pardon for yesterday, but I consider it my duty to tell you again that
I do not withdraw from my chief point."
It is me or Luzhin.
"If I am a
scoundrel, you must not be."
One is enough.
"If you marry Luzhin, I cease
at once to look on you as a sister.”

“Rodya, Rodya!"
"It is the same as yesterday again,” Pulcheria
Alexandrovna cried, mournfully."
"“And why do you call yourself a
scoundrel?"
I can’t bear it.
"You said the same yesterday.”

“Brother,” Dounia answered firmly and with the same dryness."
"“In all
this there is a mistake on your part."
"I thought it over at night,
and found out the mistake."
"It is all because you seem to fancy I am
sacrificing myself to someone and for someone."
"That is not the case at
all."
"I am simply marrying for my own sake, because things are hard for
me."
"Though, of course, I shall be glad if I succeed in being useful to
my family."
"But that is not the chief motive for my decision....”

“She is lying,” he thought to himself, biting his nails vindictively."
“Proud creature!
She won’t admit she wants to do it out of charity!
"Too
haughty!"
"Oh, base characters!"
"They even love as though they hate.... Oh,
how I... hate them all!”

“In fact,” continued Dounia, “I am marrying Pyotr Petrovitch because of
two evils I choose the less."
"I intend to do honestly all he expects of
me, so I am not deceiving him.... Why did you smile just now?” She, too,
flushed, and there was a gleam of anger in her eyes."
"“All?” he asked, with a malignant grin."
“Within certain limits.
"Both the manner and form of Pyotr Petrovitch’s
courtship showed me at once what he wanted."
"He may, of course, think too
well of himself, but I hope he esteems me, too.... Why are you laughing
again?”

“And why are you blushing again?"
"You are lying, sister."
"You are
intentionally lying, simply from feminine obstinacy, simply to hold your
own against me.... You cannot respect Luzhin."
"I have seen him and talked
with him."
"So you are selling yourself for money, and so in any case you
are acting basely, and I am glad at least that you can blush for it.”

“It is not true."
"I am not lying,” cried Dounia, losing her composure."
"“I would not marry him if I were not convinced that he esteems me
and thinks highly of me."
"I would not marry him if I were not firmly
convinced that I can respect him."
"Fortunately, I can have convincing
proof of it this very day... and such a marriage is not a vileness, as
you say!"
"And even if you were right, if I really had determined on a
vile action, is it not merciless on your part to speak to me like that?"
Why do you demand of me a heroism that perhaps you have not either?
"It
is despotism; it is tyranny."
"If I ruin anyone, it is only myself...."
"I
am not committing a murder."
Why do you look at me like that?
"Why are you
so pale?"
"Rodya, darling, what’s the matter?”

“Good heavens!"
"You have made him faint,” cried Pulcheria Alexandrovna."
"“No, no, nonsense!"
It’s nothing.
A little giddiness--not fainting.
"You
have fainting on the brain."
"H’m, yes, what was I saying?"
"Oh, yes."
"In
what way will you get convincing proof to-day that you can respect him,
and that he... esteems you, as you said."
"I think you said to-day?”

“Mother, show Rodya Pyotr Petrovitch’s letter,” said Dounia."
"With trembling hands, Pulcheria Alexandrovna gave him the letter."
"He
took it with great interest, but, before opening it, he suddenly looked
with a sort of wonder at Dounia."
"“It is strange,” he said, slowly, as though struck by a new idea."
"“What
am I making such a fuss for?"
What is it all about?
"Marry whom you like!”

He said this as though to himself, but said it aloud, and looked for
some time at his sister, as though puzzled."
"He opened the letter at
last, still with the same look of strange wonder on his face."
"Then,
slowly and attentively, he began reading, and read it through twice."
"Pulcheria Alexandrovna showed marked anxiety, and all indeed expected
something particular."
"“What surprises me,” he began, after a short pause, handing the letter
to his mother, but not addressing anyone in particular, “is that he is a
business man, a lawyer, and his conversation is pretentious indeed, and
yet he writes such an uneducated letter.”

They all started."
They had expected something quite different.
"“But they all write like that, you know,” Razumihin observed, abruptly."
"“Have you read it?”

“Yes.”

“We showed him, Rodya."
"We... consulted him just now,” Pulcheria
Alexandrovna began, embarrassed."
"“That’s just the jargon of the courts,” Razumihin put in."
"“Legal
documents are written like that to this day.”

“Legal?"
"Yes, it’s just legal--business language--not so very uneducated,
and not quite educated--business language!”

“Pyotr Petrovitch makes no secret of the fact that he had a cheap
education, he is proud indeed of having made his own way,” Avdotya
Romanovna observed, somewhat offended by her brother’s tone."
"“Well, if he’s proud of it, he has reason, I don’t deny it."
"You seem to
be offended, sister, at my making only such a frivolous criticism on the
letter, and to think that I speak of such trifling matters on purpose to
annoy you."
"It is quite the contrary, an observation apropos of the style
occurred to me that is by no means irrelevant as things stand."
"There
is one expression, ‘blame yourselves’ put in very significantly and
plainly, and there is besides a threat that he will go away at once if I
am present."
"That threat to go away is equivalent to a threat to abandon
you both if you are disobedient, and to abandon you now after summoning
you to Petersburg."
"Well, what do you think?"
"Can one resent such an
expression from Luzhin, as we should if he (he pointed to Razumihin) had
written it, or Zossimov, or one of us?”

“N-no,” answered Dounia, with more animation."
"“I saw clearly that it
was too naïvely expressed, and that perhaps he simply has no skill
in writing... that is a true criticism, brother."
"I did not expect,
indeed...”

“It is expressed in legal style, and sounds coarser than perhaps he
intended."
But I must disillusion you a little.
"There is one expression
in the letter, one slander about me, and rather a contemptible one."
"I
gave the money last night to the widow, a woman in consumption, crushed
with trouble, and not ‘on the pretext of the funeral,’ but simply to pay
for the funeral, and not to the daughter--a young woman, as he writes,
of notorious behaviour (whom I saw last night for the first time in my
life)--but to the widow."
"In all this I see a too hasty desire to slander
me and to raise dissension between us."
"It is expressed again in legal
jargon, that is to say, with a too obvious display of the aim, and
with a very naïve eagerness."
"He is a man of intelligence, but to act
sensibly, intelligence is not enough."
It all shows the man and...
"I
don’t think he has a great esteem for you."
"I tell you this simply to
warn you, because I sincerely wish for your good...”

Dounia did not reply."
Her resolution had been taken.
"She was only
awaiting the evening."
"“Then what is your decision, Rodya?” asked Pulcheria Alexandrovna, who
was more uneasy than ever at the sudden, new businesslike tone of his
talk."
"“What decision?”

“You see Pyotr Petrovitch writes that you are not to be with us this
evening, and that he will go away if you come."
"So will you... come?”

“That, of course, is not for me to decide, but for you first, if you are
not offended by such a request; and secondly, by Dounia, if she, too, is
not offended."
"I will do what you think best,” he added, drily."
"“Dounia has already decided, and I fully agree with her,” Pulcheria
Alexandrovna hastened to declare."
"“I decided to ask you, Rodya, to urge you not to fail to be with us at
this interview,” said Dounia."
"“Will you come?”

“Yes.”

“I will ask you, too, to be with us at eight o’clock,” she said,
addressing Razumihin."
"“Mother, I am inviting him, too.”

“Quite right, Dounia."
"Well, since you have decided,” added Pulcheria
Alexandrovna, “so be it."
I shall feel easier myself.
"I do not like
concealment and deception."
"Better let us have the whole truth.... Pyotr
Petrovitch may be angry or not, now!”



CHAPTER IV

At that moment the door was softly opened, and a young girl walked into
the room, looking timidly about her."
"Everyone turned towards her with
surprise and curiosity."
"At first sight, Raskolnikov did not recognise
her."
It was Sofya Semyonovna Marmeladov.
"He had seen her yesterday for
the first time, but at such a moment, in such surroundings and in such
a dress, that his memory retained a very different image of her."
"Now she
was a modestly and poorly-dressed young girl, very young, indeed,
almost like a child, with a modest and refined manner, with a candid but
somewhat frightened-looking face."
"She was wearing a very plain indoor
dress, and had on a shabby old-fashioned hat, but she still carried a
parasol."
"Unexpectedly finding the room full of people, she was not so
much embarrassed as completely overwhelmed with shyness, like a
little child."
She was even about to retreat.
"“Oh... it’s you!” said
Raskolnikov, extremely astonished, and he, too, was confused."
"He at once
recollected that his mother and sister knew through Luzhin’s letter
of “some young woman of notorious behaviour.” He had only just been
protesting against Luzhin’s calumny and declaring that he had seen the
girl last night for the first time, and suddenly she had walked in."
"He
remembered, too, that he had not protested against the expression “of
notorious behaviour.” All this passed vaguely and fleetingly through
his brain, but looking at her more intently, he saw that the humiliated
creature was so humiliated that he felt suddenly sorry for her."
"When she
made a movement to retreat in terror, it sent a pang to his heart."
"“I did not expect you,” he said, hurriedly, with a look that made her
stop."
“Please sit down.
"You come, no doubt, from Katerina Ivanovna."
Allow me--not there.
"Sit here....”

At Sonia’s entrance, Razumihin, who had been sitting on one of
Raskolnikov’s three chairs, close to the door, got up to allow her to
enter."
"Raskolnikov had at first shown her the place on the sofa where
Zossimov had been sitting, but feeling that the sofa which served him
as a bed, was too _familiar_ a place, he hurriedly motioned her to
Razumihin’s chair."
"“You sit here,” he said to Razumihin, putting him on the sofa."
"Sonia sat down, almost shaking with terror, and looked timidly at the
two ladies."
"It was evidently almost inconceivable to herself that she
could sit down beside them."
"At the thought of it, she was so frightened
that she hurriedly got up again, and in utter confusion addressed
Raskolnikov."
“I...
I... have come for one minute.
"Forgive me for disturbing you,” she
began falteringly."
"“I come from Katerina Ivanovna, and she had no one to
send."
"Katerina Ivanovna told me to beg you... to be at the service... in
the morning... at Mitrofanievsky... and then... to us... to her...
to do her the honour... she told me to beg you...” Sonia stammered and
ceased speaking."
"“I will try, certainly, most certainly,” answered Raskolnikov."
"He,
too, stood up, and he, too, faltered and could not finish his sentence."
"“Please sit down,” he said, suddenly."
“I want to talk to you.
"You are
perhaps in a hurry, but please, be so kind, spare me two minutes,” and
he drew up a chair for her."
"Sonia sat down again, and again timidly she took a hurried, frightened
look at the two ladies, and dropped her eyes."
"Raskolnikov’s pale face
flushed, a shudder passed over him, his eyes glowed."
"“Mother,” he said, firmly and insistently, “this is Sofya Semyonovna
Marmeladov, the daughter of that unfortunate Mr. Marmeladov, who was run
over yesterday before my eyes, and of whom I was just telling you.”

Pulcheria Alexandrovna glanced at Sonia, and slightly screwed up
her eyes."
"In spite of her embarrassment before Rodya’s urgent and
challenging look, she could not deny herself that satisfaction."
"Dounia
gazed gravely and intently into the poor girl’s face, and scrutinised
her with perplexity."
"Sonia, hearing herself introduced, tried to raise
her eyes again, but was more embarrassed than ever."
"“I wanted to ask you,” said Raskolnikov, hastily, “how things were
arranged yesterday."
"You were not worried by the police, for instance?”

“No, that was all right... it was too evident, the cause of death...
they did not worry us... only the lodgers are angry.”

“Why?”

“At the body’s remaining so long."
You see it is hot now.
"So that,
to-day, they will carry it to the cemetery, into the chapel, until
to-morrow."
"At first Katerina Ivanovna was unwilling, but now she sees
herself that it’s necessary...”

“To-day, then?”

“She begs you to do us the honour to be in the church to-morrow for the
service, and then to be present at the funeral lunch.”

“She is giving a funeral lunch?”

“Yes... just a little.... She told me to thank you very much for helping
us yesterday."
"But for you, we should have had nothing for the funeral.”

All at once her lips and chin began trembling, but, with an effort, she
controlled herself, looking down again."
"During the conversation, Raskolnikov watched her carefully."
"She had a
thin, very thin, pale little face, rather irregular and angular, with a
sharp little nose and chin."
"She could not have been called pretty, but
her blue eyes were so clear, and when they lighted up, there was such
a kindliness and simplicity in her expression that one could not help
being attracted."
"Her face, and her whole figure indeed, had another
peculiar characteristic."
"In spite of her eighteen years, she looked
almost a little girl--almost a child."
"And in some of her gestures, this
childishness seemed almost absurd."
“But has Katerina Ivanovna been able to manage with such small means?
"Does she even mean to have a funeral lunch?” Raskolnikov asked,
persistently keeping up the conversation."
"“The coffin will be plain, of course... and everything will be plain, so
it won’t cost much."
"Katerina Ivanovna and I have reckoned it all out, so
that there will be enough left... and Katerina Ivanovna was very anxious
it should be so."
"You know one can’t... it’s a comfort to her... she is
like that, you know....”

“I understand, I understand... of course... why do you look at my room
like that?"
"My mother has just said it is like a tomb.”

“You gave us everything yesterday,” Sonia said suddenly, in reply, in a
loud rapid whisper; and again she looked down in confusion."
"Her lips
and chin were trembling once more."
"She had been struck at once
by Raskolnikov’s poor surroundings, and now these words broke out
spontaneously."
A silence followed.
"There was a light in Dounia’s eyes,
and even Pulcheria Alexandrovna looked kindly at Sonia."
"“Rodya,” she said, getting up, “we shall have dinner together, of
course."
"Come, Dounia.... And you, Rodya, had better go for a little
walk, and then rest and lie down before you come to see us...."
"I am
afraid we have exhausted you....”

“Yes, yes, I’ll come,” he answered, getting up fussily."
"“But I have
something to see to.”

“But surely you will have dinner together?” cried Razumihin, looking in
surprise at Raskolnikov."
"“What do you mean?”

“Yes, yes, I am coming... of course, of course!"
And you stay a minute.
"You do not want him just now, do you, mother?"
"Or perhaps I am taking him
from you?”

“Oh, no, no."
"And will you, Dmitri Prokofitch, do us the favour of dining
with us?”

“Please do,” added Dounia."
"Razumihin bowed, positively radiant."
"For one moment, they were all
strangely embarrassed."
"“Good-bye, Rodya, that is till we meet."
I do not like saying good-bye.
"Good-bye, Nastasya."
"Ah, I have said good-bye again.”

Pulcheria Alexandrovna meant to greet Sonia, too; but it somehow failed
to come off, and she went in a flutter out of the room."
"But Avdotya Romanovna seemed to await her turn, and following her mother
out, gave Sonia an attentive, courteous bow."
"Sonia, in confusion, gave
a hurried, frightened curtsy."
"There was a look of poignant discomfort
in her face, as though Avdotya Romanovna’s courtesy and attention were
oppressive and painful to her."
"“Dounia, good-bye,” called Raskolnikov, in the passage."
"“Give me your
hand.”

“Why, I did give it to you."
"Have you forgotten?” said Dounia, turning
warmly and awkwardly to him."
"“Never mind, give it to me again.” And he squeezed her fingers warmly."
"Dounia smiled, flushed, pulled her hand away, and went off quite happy."
"“Come, that’s capital,” he said to Sonia, going back and looking
brightly at her."
"“God give peace to the dead, the living have still to
live."
"That is right, isn’t it?”

Sonia looked surprised at the sudden brightness of his face."
"He looked
at her for some moments in silence."
"The whole history of the dead father
floated before his memory in those moments....

*****

“Heavens, Dounia,” Pulcheria Alexandrovna began, as soon as they were in
the street, “I really feel relieved myself at coming away--more at ease."
"How little did I think yesterday in the train that I could ever be glad
of that.”

“I tell you again, mother, he is still very ill. Don’t you see it?"
Perhaps worrying about us upset him.
"We must be patient, and much, much
can be forgiven.”

“Well, you were not very patient!” Pulcheria Alexandrovna caught her up,
hotly and jealously."
"“Do you know, Dounia, I was looking at you two."
"You
are the very portrait of him, and not so much in face as in soul."
"You
are both melancholy, both morose and hot-tempered, both haughty and both
generous...."
"Surely he can’t be an egoist, Dounia."
Eh?
"When I think of
what is in store for us this evening, my heart sinks!”

“Don’t be uneasy, mother."
"What must be, will be.”

“Dounia, only think what a position we are in!"
"What if Pyotr Petrovitch
breaks it off?” poor Pulcheria Alexandrovna blurted out, incautiously."
"“He won’t be worth much if he does,” answered Dounia, sharply and
contemptuously."
"“We did well to come away,” Pulcheria Alexandrovna hurriedly broke in."
“He was in a hurry about some business or other.
"If he gets out and has
a breath of air... it is fearfully close in his room...."
"But where is
one to get a breath of air here?"
"The very streets here feel like shut-up
rooms."
Good heavens!
what a town!...
"stay... this side... they will
crush you--carrying something."
"Why, it is a piano they have got, I
declare... how they push!..."
"I am very much afraid of that young woman,
too.”

“What young woman, mother?"
"“Why, that Sofya Semyonovna, who was there just now.”

“Why?”

“I have a presentiment, Dounia."
"Well, you may believe it or not, but
as soon as she came in, that very minute, I felt that she was the chief
cause of the trouble....”

“Nothing of the sort!” cried Dounia, in vexation."
"“What nonsense, with
your presentiments, mother!"
"He only made her acquaintance the evening
before, and he did not know her when she came in.”

“Well, you will see.... She worries me; but you will see, you will
see!"
I was so frightened.
She was gazing at me with those eyes.
"I could
scarcely sit still in my chair when he began introducing her, do you
remember?"
"It seems so strange, but Pyotr Petrovitch writes like that
about her, and he introduces her to us--to you!"
"So he must think a great
deal of her.”

“People will write anything."
"We were talked about and written about,
too."
Have you forgotten?
"I am sure that she is a good girl, and that it
is all nonsense.”

“God grant it may be!”

“And Pyotr Petrovitch is a contemptible slanderer,” Dounia snapped out,
suddenly."
Pulcheria Alexandrovna was crushed; the conversation was not resumed.
"*****

“I will tell you what I want with you,” said Raskolnikov, drawing
Razumihin to the window."
"“Then I will tell Katerina Ivanovna that you are coming,” Sonia said
hurriedly, preparing to depart."
"“One minute, Sofya Semyonovna."
We have no secrets.
"You are not in our
way."
I want to have another word or two with you.
"Listen!” he turned
suddenly to Razumihin again."
"“You know that... what’s his name...
Porfiry Petrovitch?”

“I should think so!"
He is a relation.
"Why?” added the latter, with
interest."
"“Is not he managing that case... you know, about that murder?..."
"You
were speaking about it yesterday.”

“Yes... well?” Razumihin’s eyes opened wide."
"“He was inquiring for people who had pawned things, and I have some
pledges there, too--trifles--a ring my sister gave me as a keepsake when
I left home, and my father’s silver watch--they are only worth five or
six roubles altogether... but I value them."
So what am I to do now?
"I
do not want to lose the things, especially the watch."
"I was quaking just
now, for fear mother would ask to look at it, when we spoke of Dounia’s
watch."
It is the only thing of father’s left us.
"She would be ill if
it were lost."
You know what women are.
So tell me what to do.
"I know I
ought to have given notice at the police station, but would it not be
better to go straight to Porfiry?"
Eh?
What do you think?
"The matter
might be settled more quickly."
"You see, mother may ask for it before
dinner.”

“Certainly not to the police station."
"Certainly to Porfiry,” Razumihin
shouted in extraordinary excitement."
"“Well, how glad I am."
"Let us go at
once."
It is a couple of steps.
"We shall be sure to find him.”

“Very well, let us go.”

“And he will be very, very glad to make your acquaintance."
"I have
often talked to him of you at different times."
"I was speaking of you
yesterday."
Let us go.
So you knew the old woman?
So that’s it!
"It is all
turning out splendidly.... Oh, yes, Sofya Ivanovna...”

“Sofya Semyonovna,” corrected Raskolnikov."
"“Sofya Semyonovna, this is my
friend Razumihin, and he is a good man.”

“If you have to go now,” Sonia was beginning, not looking at Razumihin
at all, and still more embarrassed."
"“Let us go,” decided Raskolnikov."
"“I will come to you to-day, Sofya
Semyonovna."
"Only tell me where you live.”

He was not exactly ill at ease, but seemed hurried, and avoided her
eyes."
"Sonia gave her address, and flushed as she did so."
"They all went
out together."
"“Don’t you lock up?” asked Razumihin, following him on to the stairs."
"“Never,” answered Raskolnikov."
"“I have been meaning to buy a lock for
these two years."
"People are happy who have no need of locks,” he said,
laughing, to Sonia."
They stood still in the gateway.
"“Do you go to the right, Sofya Semyonovna?"
"How did you find me, by the
way?” he added, as though he wanted to say something quite different."
"He
wanted to look at her soft clear eyes, but this was not easy."
"“Why, you gave your address to Polenka yesterday.”

“Polenka?"
"Oh, yes; Polenka, that is the little girl."
She is your sister?
"Did I give her the address?”

“Why, had you forgotten?”

“No, I remember.”

“I had heard my father speak of you... only I did not know your name,
and he did not know it."
"And now I came... and as I had learnt your name,
I asked to-day, ‘Where does Mr. Raskolnikov live?’ I did not know you
had only a room too.... Good-bye, I will tell Katerina Ivanovna.”

She was extremely glad to escape at last; she went away looking down,
hurrying to get out of sight as soon as possible, to walk the twenty
steps to the turning on the right and to be at last alone, and then
moving rapidly along, looking at no one, noticing nothing, to think, to
remember, to meditate on every word, every detail."
"Never, never had she
felt anything like this."
"Dimly and unconsciously a whole new world was
opening before her."
"She remembered suddenly that Raskolnikov meant to
come to her that day, perhaps at once!"
"“Only not to-day, please, not to-day!” she kept muttering with a sinking
heart, as though entreating someone, like a frightened child."
“Mercy!
"to
me... to that room... he will see... oh, dear!”

She was not capable at that instant of noticing an unknown gentleman who
was watching her and following at her heels."
"He had accompanied her from
the gateway."
"At the moment when Razumihin, Raskolnikov, and she stood
still at parting on the pavement, this gentleman, who was just passing,
started on hearing Sonia’s words: “and I asked where Mr. Raskolnikov
lived?” He turned a rapid but attentive look upon all three, especially
upon Raskolnikov, to whom Sonia was speaking; then looked back and noted
the house."
"All this was done in an instant as he passed, and trying not
to betray his interest, he walked on more slowly as though waiting for
something."
"He was waiting for Sonia; he saw that they were parting, and
that Sonia was going home."
“Home?
Where?
"I’ve seen that face somewhere,” he thought."
"“I must find
out.”

At the turning he crossed over, looked round, and saw Sonia coming the
same way, noticing nothing."
She turned the corner.
"He followed her on
the other side."
"After about fifty paces he crossed over again, overtook
her and kept two or three yards behind her."
"He was a man about fifty, rather tall and thickly set, with broad high
shoulders which made him look as though he stooped a little."
"He wore
good and fashionable clothes, and looked like a gentleman of position."
"He carried a handsome cane, which he tapped on the pavement at each
step; his gloves were spotless."
"He had a broad, rather pleasant face
with high cheek-bones and a fresh colour, not often seen in Petersburg."
"His flaxen hair was still abundant, and only touched here and there with
grey, and his thick square beard was even lighter than his hair."
"His eyes were blue and had a cold and thoughtful look; his lips were
crimson."
"He was a remarkedly well-preserved man and looked much younger
than his years."
"When Sonia came out on the canal bank, they were the only two persons on
the pavement."
He observed her dreaminess and preoccupation.
"On reaching
the house where she lodged, Sonia turned in at the gate; he followed
her, seeming rather surprised."
"In the courtyard she turned to the right
corner."
"“Bah!” muttered the unknown gentleman, and mounted the stairs
behind her."
Only then Sonia noticed him.
"She reached the third storey,
turned down the passage, and rang at No."
9.
"On the door was inscribed
in chalk, “Kapernaumov, Tailor.” “Bah!” the stranger repeated again,
wondering at the strange coincidence, and he rang next door, at No."
8.
The doors were two or three yards apart.
"“You lodge at Kapernaumov’s,” he said, looking at Sonia and laughing."
“He altered a waistcoat for me yesterday.
"I am staying close here at
Madame Resslich’s."
How odd!” Sonia looked at him attentively.
"“We are neighbours,” he went on gaily."
"“I only came to town the day
before yesterday."
"Good-bye for the present.”

Sonia made no reply; the door opened and she slipped in."
"She felt for
some reason ashamed and uneasy."
"*****

On the way to Porfiry’s, Razumihin was obviously excited."
"“That’s capital, brother,” he repeated several times, “and I am glad!"
"I
am glad!”

“What are you glad about?” Raskolnikov thought to himself."
"“I didn’t know that you pledged things at the old woman’s, too."
"And...
was it long ago?"
"I mean, was it long since you were there?”

“What a simple-hearted fool he is!”

“When was it?” Raskolnikov stopped still to recollect."
"“Two or three
days before her death it must have been."
"But I am not going to redeem
the things now,” he put in with a sort of hurried and conspicuous
solicitude about the things."
"“I’ve not more than a silver rouble
left... after last night’s accursed delirium!”

He laid special emphasis on the delirium."
"“Yes, yes,” Razumihin hastened to agree--with what was not clear."
"“Then
that’s why you... were stuck... partly... you know in your delirium you
were continually mentioning some rings or chains!"
"Yes, yes... that’s
clear, it’s all clear now.”

“Hullo!"
How that idea must have got about among them.
"Here this man will
go to the stake for me, and I find him delighted at having it _cleared
up_ why I spoke of rings in my delirium!"
"What a hold the idea must have
on all of them!”

“Shall we find him?” he asked suddenly."
"“Oh, yes,” Razumihin answered quickly."
"“He is a nice fellow, you will
see, brother."
"Rather clumsy, that is to say, he is a man of polished
manners, but I mean clumsy in a different sense."
"He is an intelligent
fellow, very much so indeed, but he has his own range of ideas...."
"He
is incredulous, sceptical, cynical... he likes to impose on people, or
rather to make fun of them."
"His is the old, circumstantial method...."
"But he understands his work... thoroughly.... Last year he cleared up a
case of murder in which the police had hardly a clue."
"He is very, very
anxious to make your acquaintance!”

“On what grounds is he so anxious?”

“Oh, it’s not exactly... you see, since you’ve been ill I happen to have
mentioned you several times...."
"So, when he heard about you... about
your being a law student and not able to finish your studies, he said,
‘What a pity!’ And so I concluded... from everything together, not only
that; yesterday Zametov... you know, Rodya, I talked some nonsense on
the way home to you yesterday, when I was drunk..."
"I am afraid, brother,
of your exaggerating it, you see.”

“What?"
That they think I am a madman?
"Maybe they are right,” he said
with a constrained smile."
"“Yes, yes.... That is, pooh, no!..."
"But all that I said (and there was
something else too) it was all nonsense, drunken nonsense.”

“But why are you apologising?"
"I am so sick of it all!” Raskolnikov cried
with exaggerated irritability."
"It was partly assumed, however."
"“I know, I know, I understand."
"Believe me, I understand."
"One’s ashamed
to speak of it.”

“If you are ashamed, then don’t speak of it.”

Both were silent."
"Razumihin was more than ecstatic and Raskolnikov
perceived it with repulsion."
"He was alarmed, too, by what Razumihin had
just said about Porfiry."
"“I shall have to pull a long face with him too,” he thought, with a
beating heart, and he turned white, “and do it naturally, too."
"But the
most natural thing would be to do nothing at all."
"Carefully do nothing
at all!"
"No, _carefully_ would not be natural again.... Oh, well, we
shall see how it turns out.... We shall see... directly."
"Is it a good
thing to go or not?"
The butterfly flies to the light.
"My heart is
beating, that’s what’s bad!”

“In this grey house,” said Razumihin."
"“The most important thing, does Porfiry know that I was at the old
hag’s flat yesterday... and asked about the blood?"
"I must find that out
instantly, as soon as I go in, find out from his face; otherwise... I’ll
find out, if it’s my ruin.”

“I say, brother,” he said suddenly, addressing Razumihin, with a sly
smile, “I have been noticing all day that you seem to be curiously
excited."
"Isn’t it so?”

“Excited?"
"Not a bit of it,” said Razumihin, stung to the quick."
"“Yes, brother, I assure you it’s noticeable."
"Why, you sat on your chair
in a way you never do sit, on the edge somehow, and you seemed to be
writhing all the time."
You kept jumping up for nothing.
"One moment you
were angry, and the next your face looked like a sweetmeat."
"You even
blushed; especially when you were invited to dinner, you blushed
awfully.”

“Nothing of the sort, nonsense!"
"What do you mean?”

“But why are you wriggling out of it, like a schoolboy?"
"By Jove, there
he’s blushing again.”

“What a pig you are!”

“But why are you so shamefaced about it?"
Romeo!
"Stay, I’ll tell of you
to-day."
Ha-ha-ha!
"I’ll make mother laugh, and someone else, too...”

“Listen, listen, listen, this is serious.... What next, you fiend!”
 Razumihin was utterly overwhelmed, turning cold with horror."
"“What will
you tell them?"
"Come, brother... foo!"
"what a pig you are!”

“You are like a summer rose."
"And if only you knew how it suits you; a
Romeo over six foot high!"
"And how you’ve washed to-day--you cleaned your
nails, I declare."
Eh?
That’s something unheard of!
"Why, I do believe
you’ve got pomatum on your hair!"
"Bend down.”

“Pig!”

Raskolnikov laughed as though he could not restrain himself."
"So
laughing, they entered Porfiry Petrovitch’s flat."
"This is what
Raskolnikov wanted: from within they could be heard laughing as they
came in, still guffawing in the passage."
"“Not a word here or I’ll... brain you!” Razumihin whispered furiously,
seizing Raskolnikov by the shoulder."
"CHAPTER V

Raskolnikov was already entering the room."
"He came in looking as though
he had the utmost difficulty not to burst out laughing again."
"Behind him
Razumihin strode in gawky and awkward, shamefaced and red as a peony,
with an utterly crestfallen and ferocious expression."
"His face and
whole figure really were ridiculous at that moment and amply justified
Raskolnikov’s laughter."
"Raskolnikov, not waiting for an introduction,
bowed to Porfiry Petrovitch, who stood in the middle of the room
looking inquiringly at them."
"He held out his hand and shook hands, still
apparently making desperate efforts to subdue his mirth and utter a few
words to introduce himself."
"But he had no sooner succeeded in assuming
a serious air and muttering something when he suddenly glanced again as
though accidentally at Razumihin, and could no longer control himself:
his stifled laughter broke out the more irresistibly the more he tried
to restrain it."
"The extraordinary ferocity with which Razumihin received
this “spontaneous” mirth gave the whole scene the appearance of most
genuine fun and naturalness."
"Razumihin strengthened this impression as
though on purpose."
“Fool!
"You fiend,” he roared, waving his arm which at once struck a
little round table with an empty tea-glass on it."
"Everything was sent
flying and crashing."
"“But why break chairs, gentlemen?"
"You know it’s a loss to the Crown,”
 Porfiry Petrovitch quoted gaily."
"Raskolnikov was still laughing, with his hand in Porfiry Petrovitch’s,
but anxious not to overdo it, awaited the right moment to put a natural
end to it."
"Razumihin, completely put to confusion by upsetting the table
and smashing the glass, gazed gloomily at the fragments, cursed and
turned sharply to the window where he stood looking out with his back
to the company with a fiercely scowling countenance, seeing nothing."
"Porfiry Petrovitch laughed and was ready to go on laughing, but
obviously looked for explanations."
"Zametov had been sitting in the
corner, but he rose at the visitors’ entrance and was standing in
expectation with a smile on his lips, though he looked with surprise and
even it seemed incredulity at the whole scene and at Raskolnikov with a
certain embarrassment."
"Zametov’s unexpected presence struck Raskolnikov
unpleasantly."
"“I’ve got to think of that,” he thought."
"“Excuse me, please,” he began,
affecting extreme embarrassment."
"“Raskolnikov.”

“Not at all, very pleasant to see you... and how pleasantly you’ve come
in.... Why, won’t he even say good-morning?” Porfiry Petrovitch nodded
at Razumihin."
“Upon my honour I don’t know why he is in such a rage with me.
"I only
told him as we came along that he was like Romeo... and proved it."
"And
that was all, I think!”

“Pig!” ejaculated Razumihin, without turning round."
"“There must have been very grave grounds for it, if he is so furious at
the word,” Porfiry laughed."
"“Oh, you sharp lawyer!..."
"Damn you all!” snapped Razumihin, and suddenly
bursting out laughing himself, he went up to Porfiry with a more
cheerful face as though nothing had happened."
“That’ll do!
"We are
all fools."
To come to business.
"This is my friend Rodion Romanovitch
Raskolnikov; in the first place he has heard of you and wants to make
your acquaintance, and secondly, he has a little matter of business with
you."
Bah!
"Zametov, what brought you here?"
Have you met before?
"Have you
known each other long?”

“What does this mean?” thought Raskolnikov uneasily."
"Zametov seemed taken aback, but not very much so."
"“Why, it was at your rooms we met yesterday,” he said easily."
“Then I have been spared the trouble.
"All last week he was begging me
to introduce him to you."
"Porfiry and you have sniffed each other out
without me."
"Where is your tobacco?”

Porfiry Petrovitch was wearing a dressing-gown, very clean linen, and
trodden-down slippers."
"He was a man of about five and thirty, short,
stout even to corpulence, and clean shaven."
"He wore his hair cut short
and had a large round head, particularly prominent at the back."
"His
soft, round, rather snub-nosed face was of a sickly yellowish colour,
but had a vigorous and rather ironical expression."
"It would have been
good-natured except for a look in the eyes, which shone with a watery,
mawkish light under almost white, blinking eyelashes."
"The expression
of those eyes was strangely out of keeping with his somewhat womanish
figure, and gave it something far more serious than could be guessed at
first sight."
"As soon as Porfiry Petrovitch heard that his visitor had a little matter
of business with him, he begged him to sit down on the sofa and sat down
himself on the other end, waiting for him to explain his business, with
that careful and over-serious attention which is at once oppressive and
embarrassing, especially to a stranger, and especially if what you are
discussing is in your opinion of far too little importance for such
exceptional solemnity."
"But in brief and coherent phrases Raskolnikov
explained his business clearly and exactly, and was so well satisfied
with himself that he even succeeded in taking a good look at Porfiry."
Porfiry Petrovitch did not once take his eyes off him.
"Razumihin,
sitting opposite at the same table, listened warmly and impatiently,
looking from one to the other every moment with rather excessive
interest."
"“Fool,” Raskolnikov swore to himself."
"“You have to give information to the police,” Porfiry replied, with a
most businesslike air, “that having learnt of this incident, that is of
the murder, you beg to inform the lawyer in charge of the case that such
and such things belong to you, and that you desire to redeem them...
or... but they will write to you.”

“That’s just the point, that at the present moment,” Raskolnikov tried
his utmost to feign embarrassment, “I am not quite in funds... and
even this trifling sum is beyond me..."
"I only wanted, you see, for
the present to declare that the things are mine, and that when I have
money....”

“That’s no matter,” answered Porfiry Petrovitch, receiving his
explanation of his pecuniary position coldly, “but you can, if you
prefer, write straight to me, to say, that having been informed of the
matter, and claiming such and such as your property, you beg...”

“On an ordinary sheet of paper?” Raskolnikov interrupted eagerly, again
interested in the financial side of the question."
"“Oh, the most ordinary,” and suddenly Porfiry Petrovitch looked with
obvious irony at him, screwing up his eyes and, as it were, winking at
him."
"But perhaps it was Raskolnikov’s fancy, for it all lasted but a
moment."
"There was certainly something of the sort, Raskolnikov could
have sworn he winked at him, goodness knows why."
"“He knows,” flashed through his mind like lightning."
"“Forgive my troubling you about such trifles,” he went on, a little
disconcerted, “the things are only worth five roubles, but I prize them
particularly for the sake of those from whom they came to me, and I must
confess that I was alarmed when I heard...”

“That’s why you were so much struck when I mentioned to Zossimov that
Porfiry was inquiring for everyone who had pledges!” Razumihin put in
with obvious intention."
This was really unbearable.
"Raskolnikov could not help glancing at him
with a flash of vindictive anger in his black eyes, but immediately
recollected himself."
"“You seem to be jeering at me, brother?” he said to him, with a
well-feigned irritability."
"“I dare say I do seem to you absurdly anxious
about such trash; but you mustn’t think me selfish or grasping for that,
and these two things may be anything but trash in my eyes."
"I told you
just now that the silver watch, though it’s not worth a cent, is the
only thing left us of my father’s."
"You may laugh at me, but my mother is
here,” he turned suddenly to Porfiry, “and if she knew,” he turned again
hurriedly to Razumihin, carefully making his voice tremble, “that the
watch was lost, she would be in despair!"
"You know what women are!”

“Not a bit of it!"
I didn’t mean that at all!
"Quite the contrary!”
 shouted Razumihin distressed."
“Was it right?
Was it natural?
"Did I overdo it?” Raskolnikov asked
himself in a tremor."
"“Why did I say that about women?”

“Oh, your mother is with you?” Porfiry Petrovitch inquired."
"“Yes.”

“When did she come?”

“Last night.”

Porfiry paused as though reflecting."
"“Your things would not in any case be lost,” he went on calmly and
coldly."
"“I have been expecting you here for some time.”

And as though that was a matter of no importance, he carefully offered
the ash-tray to Razumihin, who was ruthlessly scattering cigarette ash
over the carpet."
"Raskolnikov shuddered, but Porfiry did not seem to be
looking at him, and was still concerned with Razumihin’s cigarette."
“What?
Expecting him?
"Why, did you know that he had pledges _there_?”
 cried Razumihin."
Porfiry Petrovitch addressed himself to Raskolnikov.
"“Your things, the ring and the watch, were wrapped up together, and on
the paper your name was legibly written in pencil, together with the
date on which you left them with her...”

“How observant you are!” Raskolnikov smiled awkwardly, doing his very
utmost to look him straight in the face, but he failed, and suddenly
added:

“I say that because I suppose there were a great many pledges... that it
must be difficult to remember them all...."
"But you remember them all so
clearly, and... and...”

“Stupid!"
Feeble!” he thought.
"“Why did I add that?”

“But we know all who had pledges, and you are the only one who hasn’t
come forward,” Porfiry answered with hardly perceptible irony."
"“I haven’t been quite well.”

“I heard that too."
"I heard, indeed, that you were in great distress
about something."
"You look pale still.”

“I am not pale at all.... No, I am quite well,” Raskolnikov snapped
out rudely and angrily, completely changing his tone."
"His anger was
mounting, he could not repress it."
"“And in my anger I shall betray
myself,” flashed through his mind again."
"“Why are they torturing me?”

“Not quite well!” Razumihin caught him up."
“What next!
"He was
unconscious and delirious all yesterday."
"Would you believe, Porfiry, as
soon as our backs were turned, he dressed, though he could hardly stand,
and gave us the slip and went off on a spree somewhere till midnight,
delirious all the time!"
Would you believe it!
"Extraordinary!”

“Really delirious?"
"You don’t say so!” Porfiry shook his head in a
womanish way."
“Nonsense!
Don’t you believe it!
"But you don’t believe it anyway,”
 Raskolnikov let slip in his anger."
"But Porfiry Petrovitch did not seem
to catch those strange words."
"“But how could you have gone out if you hadn’t been delirious?”
 Razumihin got hot suddenly."
“What did you go out for?
"What was the
object of it?"
And why on the sly?
"Were you in your senses when you did
it?"
"Now that all danger is over I can speak plainly.”

“I was awfully sick of them yesterday.” Raskolnikov addressed Porfiry
suddenly with a smile of insolent defiance, “I ran away from them to
take lodgings where they wouldn’t find me, and took a lot of money with
me."
Mr. Zametov there saw it.
"I say, Mr. Zametov, was I sensible or
delirious yesterday; settle our dispute.”

He could have strangled Zametov at that moment, so hateful were his
expression and his silence to him."
"“In my opinion you talked sensibly and even artfully, but you were
extremely irritable,” Zametov pronounced dryly."
"“And Nikodim Fomitch was telling me to-day,” put in Porfiry Petrovitch,
“that he met you very late last night in the lodging of a man who had
been run over.”

“And there,” said Razumihin, “weren’t you mad then?"
"You gave your last
penny to the widow for the funeral."
"If you wanted to help, give fifteen
or twenty even, but keep three roubles for yourself at least, but he
flung away all the twenty-five at once!”

“Maybe I found a treasure somewhere and you know nothing of it?"
"So
that’s why I was liberal yesterday.... Mr. Zametov knows I’ve found a
treasure!"
"Excuse us, please, for disturbing you for half an hour
with such trivialities,” he said, turning to Porfiry Petrovitch, with
trembling lips."
"“We are boring you, aren’t we?”

“Oh no, quite the contrary, quite the contrary!"
"If only you knew how you
interest me!"
"It’s interesting to look on and listen... and I am really
glad you have come forward at last.”

“But you might give us some tea!"
"My throat’s dry,” cried Razumihin."
“Capital idea!
Perhaps we will all keep you company.
"Wouldn’t you
like... something more essential before tea?”

“Get along with you!”

Porfiry Petrovitch went out to order tea."
Raskolnikov’s thoughts were in a whirl.
He was in terrible exasperation.
"“The worst of it is they don’t disguise it; they don’t care to stand on
ceremony!"
"And how if you didn’t know me at all, did you come to talk
to Nikodim Fomitch about me?"
"So they don’t care to hide that they are
tracking me like a pack of dogs."
"They simply spit in my face.” He was
shaking with rage."
"“Come, strike me openly, don’t play with me like a
cat with a mouse."
"It’s hardly civil, Porfiry Petrovitch, but perhaps I
won’t allow it!"
"I shall get up and throw the whole truth in your ugly
faces, and you’ll see how I despise you.” He could hardly breathe."
“And what if it’s only my fancy?
"What if I am mistaken, and through
inexperience I get angry and don’t keep up my nasty part?"
"Perhaps it’s
all unintentional."
"All their phrases are the usual ones, but there is
something about them...."
"It all might be said, but there is something."
"Why did he say bluntly, ‘With her’?"
"Why did Zametov add that I spoke
artfully?"
Why do they speak in that tone?
"Yes, the tone.... Razumihin
is sitting here, why does he see nothing?"
"That innocent blockhead never
does see anything!"
Feverish again!
Did Porfiry wink at me just now?
"Of
course it’s nonsense!"
What could he wink for?
"Are they trying to upset
my nerves or are they teasing me?"
Either it’s ill fancy or they know!
Even Zametov is rude.... Is Zametov rude?
Zametov has changed his mind.
I foresaw he would change his mind!
"He is at home here, while it’s my
first visit."
"Porfiry does not consider him a visitor; sits with his back
to him."
"They’re as thick as thieves, no doubt, over me!"
"Not a doubt they
were talking about me before we came."
Do they know about the flat?
"If
only they’d make haste!"
"When I said that I ran away to take a flat he
let it pass...."
"I put that in cleverly about a flat, it may be of use
afterwards.... Delirious, indeed... ha-ha-ha!"
"He knows all about last
night!"
He didn’t know of my mother’s arrival!
"The hag had written the
date on in pencil!"
"You are wrong, you won’t catch me!"
"There are no
facts... it’s all supposition!"
You produce facts!
"The flat even isn’t a
fact but delirium."
"I know what to say to them.... Do they know about the
flat?"
I won’t go without finding out.
What did I come for?
"But my being
angry now, maybe is a fact!"
"Fool, how irritable I am!"
"Perhaps that’s
right; to play the invalid...."
He is feeling me.
"He will try to catch
me."
"Why did I come?”

All this flashed like lightning through his mind."
Porfiry Petrovitch returned quickly.
He became suddenly more jovial.
"“Your party yesterday, brother, has left my head rather.... And I am out
of sorts altogether,” he began in quite a different tone, laughing to
Razumihin."
“Was it interesting?
I left you yesterday at the most interesting point.
"Who got the best of it?”

“Oh, no one, of course."
"They got on to everlasting questions, floated
off into space.”

“Only fancy, Rodya, what we got on to yesterday."
"Whether there is such a
thing as crime."
"I told you that we talked our heads off.”

“What is there strange?"
"It’s an everyday social question,” Raskolnikov
answered casually."
"“The question wasn’t put quite like that,” observed Porfiry."
"“Not quite, that’s true,” Razumihin agreed at once, getting warm and
hurried as usual."
"“Listen, Rodion, and tell us your opinion, I want to
hear it."
"I was fighting tooth and nail with them and wanted you to
help me."
I told them you were coming....
"It began with the socialist
doctrine."
"You know their doctrine; crime is a protest against the
abnormality of the social organisation and nothing more, and nothing
more; no other causes admitted!...”

“You are wrong there,” cried Porfiry Petrovitch; he was noticeably
animated and kept laughing as he looked at Razumihin, which made him
more excited than ever."
"“Nothing is admitted,” Razumihin interrupted with heat."
“I am not wrong.
I’ll show you their pamphlets.
"Everything with them
is ‘the influence of environment,’ and nothing else."
"Their favourite
phrase!"
"From which it follows that, if society is normally organised,
all crime will cease at once, since there will be nothing to protest
against and all men will become righteous in one instant."
"Human nature
is not taken into account, it is excluded, it’s not supposed to exist!"
"They don’t recognise that humanity, developing by a historical living
process, will become at last a normal society, but they believe that a
social system that has come out of some mathematical brain is going
to organise all humanity at once and make it just and sinless in an
instant, quicker than any living process!"
"That’s why they instinctively
dislike history, ‘nothing but ugliness and stupidity in it,’ and they
explain it all as stupidity!"
"That’s why they so dislike the _living_
process of life; they don’t want a _living soul_!"
"The living soul
demands life, the soul won’t obey the rules of mechanics, the soul is an
object of suspicion, the soul is retrograde!"
"But what they want though
it smells of death and can be made of India-rubber, at least is not
alive, has no will, is servile and won’t revolt!"
"And it comes in the end
to their reducing everything to the building of walls and the planning
of rooms and passages in a phalanstery!"
"The phalanstery is ready,
indeed, but your human nature is not ready for the phalanstery--it
wants life, it hasn’t completed its vital process, it’s too soon for the
graveyard!"
You can’t skip over nature by logic.
"Logic presupposes three
possibilities, but there are millions!"
"Cut away a million, and reduce
it all to the question of comfort!"
"That’s the easiest solution of the
problem!"
It’s seductively clear and you musn’t think about it.
"That’s
the great thing, you mustn’t think!"
"The whole secret of life in two
pages of print!”

“Now he is off, beating the drum!"
"Catch hold of him, do!” laughed
Porfiry."
"“Can you imagine,” he turned to Raskolnikov, “six people
holding forth like that last night, in one room, with punch as a
preliminary!"
"No, brother, you are wrong, environment accounts for a
great deal in crime; I can assure you of that.”

“Oh, I know it does, but just tell me: a man of forty violates a child
of ten; was it environment drove him to it?”

“Well, strictly speaking, it did,” Porfiry observed with noteworthy
gravity; “a crime of that nature may be very well ascribed to the
influence of environment.”

Razumihin was almost in a frenzy."
"“Oh, if you like,” he roared."
"“I’ll
prove to you that your white eyelashes may very well be ascribed to the
Church of Ivan the Great’s being two hundred and fifty feet high, and I
will prove it clearly, exactly, progressively, and even with a Liberal
tendency!"
I undertake to!
"Will you bet on it?”

“Done!"
"Let’s hear, please, how he will prove it!”

“He is always humbugging, confound him,” cried Razumihin, jumping up and
gesticulating."
“What’s the use of talking to you?
"He does all that
on purpose; you don’t know him, Rodion!"
"He took their side yesterday,
simply to make fools of them."
And the things he said yesterday!
"And they
were delighted!"
He can keep it up for a fortnight together.
"Last year he
persuaded us that he was going into a monastery: he stuck to it for two
months."
"Not long ago he took it into his head to declare he was going
to get married, that he had everything ready for the wedding."
"He ordered
new clothes indeed."
We all began to congratulate him.
"There was no
bride, nothing, all pure fantasy!”

“Ah, you are wrong!"
I got the clothes before.
"It was the new clothes in
fact that made me think of taking you in.”

“Are you such a good dissembler?” Raskolnikov asked carelessly."
"“You wouldn’t have supposed it, eh?"
"Wait a bit, I shall take you in,
too."
Ha-ha-ha!
"No, I’ll tell you the truth."
"All these questions about
crime, environment, children, recall to my mind an article of yours
which interested me at the time."
"‘On Crime’... or something of the
sort, I forget the title, I read it with pleasure two months ago in the
_Periodical Review_.”

“My article?"
"In the _Periodical Review_?” Raskolnikov asked in
astonishment."
"“I certainly did write an article upon a book six months
ago when I left the university, but I sent it to the _Weekly Review_.”

“But it came out in the _Periodical_.”

“And the _Weekly Review_ ceased to exist, so that’s why it wasn’t
printed at the time.”

“That’s true; but when it ceased to exist, the _Weekly Review_ was
amalgamated with the _Periodical_, and so your article appeared two
months ago in the latter."
"Didn’t you know?”

Raskolnikov had not known."
"“Why, you might get some money out of them for the article!"
"What a
strange person you are!"
"You lead such a solitary life that you know
nothing of matters that concern you directly."
"It’s a fact, I assure
you.”

“Bravo, Rodya!"
I knew nothing about it either!” cried Razumihin.
"“I’ll
run to-day to the reading-room and ask for the number."
Two months ago?
What was the date?
"It doesn’t matter though, I will find it."
"Think of
not telling us!”

“How did you find out that the article was mine?"
"It’s only signed with
an initial.”

“I only learnt it by chance, the other day."
"Through the editor; I know
him...."
"I was very much interested.”

“I analysed, if I remember, the psychology of a criminal before and
after the crime.”

“Yes, and you maintained that the perpetration of a crime is always
accompanied by illness."
"Very, very original, but... it was not that part
of your article that interested me so much, but an idea at the end of
the article which I regret to say you merely suggested without working
it out clearly."
"There is, if you recollect, a suggestion that there are
certain persons who can... that is, not precisely are able to, but have
a perfect right to commit breaches of morality and crimes, and that the
law is not for them.”

Raskolnikov smiled at the exaggerated and intentional distortion of his
idea."
“What?
What do you mean?
A right to crime?
"But not because of the
influence of environment?” Razumihin inquired with some alarm even."
"“No, not exactly because of it,” answered Porfiry."
"“In his article all
men are divided into ‘ordinary’ and ‘extraordinary.’ Ordinary men have
to live in submission, have no right to transgress the law, because,
don’t you see, they are ordinary."
"But extraordinary men have a right to
commit any crime and to transgress the law in any way, just because they
are extraordinary."
"That was your idea, if I am not mistaken?”

“What do you mean?"
"That can’t be right?” Razumihin muttered in
bewilderment."
Raskolnikov smiled again.
"He saw the point at once, and knew where they
wanted to drive him."
He decided to take up the challenge.
"“That wasn’t quite my contention,” he began simply and modestly."
"“Yet
I admit that you have stated it almost correctly; perhaps, if you like,
perfectly so.” (It almost gave him pleasure to admit this.)"
"“The only
difference is that I don’t contend that extraordinary people are always
bound to commit breaches of morals, as you call it."
"In fact, I doubt
whether such an argument could be published."
"I simply hinted that an
‘extraordinary’ man has the right... that is not an official right, but
an inner right to decide in his own conscience to overstep... certain
obstacles, and only in case it is essential for the practical fulfilment
of his idea (sometimes, perhaps, of benefit to the whole of humanity)."
"You say that my article isn’t definite; I am ready to make it as clear
as I can."
Perhaps I am right in thinking you want me to; very well.
"I
maintain that if the discoveries of Kepler and Newton could not have
been made known except by sacrificing the lives of one, a dozen, a
hundred, or more men, Newton would have had the right, would indeed have
been in duty-bound... to _eliminate_ the dozen or the hundred men for
the sake of making his discoveries known to the whole of humanity."
"But
it does not follow from that that Newton had a right to murder people
right and left and to steal every day in the market."
"Then, I remember, I
maintain in my article that all... well, legislators and leaders of men,
such as Lycurgus, Solon, Mahomet, Napoleon, and so on, were all without
exception criminals, from the very fact that, making a new law, they
transgressed the ancient one, handed down from their ancestors and held
sacred by the people, and they did not stop short at bloodshed either,
if that bloodshed--often of innocent persons fighting bravely in defence
of ancient law--were of use to their cause."
"It’s remarkable, in fact,
that the majority, indeed, of these benefactors and leaders of humanity
were guilty of terrible carnage."
"In short, I maintain that all great men
or even men a little out of the common, that is to say capable of giving
some new word, must from their very nature be criminals--more or less,
of course."
"Otherwise it’s hard for them to get out of the common rut;
and to remain in the common rut is what they can’t submit to, from their
very nature again, and to my mind they ought not, indeed, to submit to
it."
You see that there is nothing particularly new in all that.
"The
same thing has been printed and read a thousand times before."
"As for my
division of people into ordinary and extraordinary, I acknowledge that
it’s somewhat arbitrary, but I don’t insist upon exact numbers."
"I only
believe in my leading idea that men are _in general_ divided by a law
of nature into two categories, inferior (ordinary), that is, so to say,
material that serves only to reproduce its kind, and men who have
the gift or the talent to utter _a new word_."
"There are, of course,
innumerable sub-divisions, but the distinguishing features of both
categories are fairly well marked."
"The first category, generally
speaking, are men conservative in temperament and law-abiding; they live
under control and love to be controlled."
"To my thinking it is their duty
to be controlled, because that’s their vocation, and there is nothing
humiliating in it for them."
"The second category all transgress the
law; they are destroyers or disposed to destruction according to their
capacities."
"The crimes of these men are of course relative and varied;
for the most part they seek in very varied ways the destruction of the
present for the sake of the better."
"But if such a one is forced for the
sake of his idea to step over a corpse or wade through blood, he can, I
maintain, find within himself, in his conscience, a sanction for wading
through blood--that depends on the idea and its dimensions, note that."
"It’s only in that sense I speak of their right to crime in my article
(you remember it began with the legal question)."
"There’s no need for
such anxiety, however; the masses will scarcely ever admit this right,
they punish them or hang them (more or less), and in doing so fulfil
quite justly their conservative vocation."
"But the same masses set these
criminals on a pedestal in the next generation and worship them (more or
less)."
"The first category is always the man of the present, the second
the man of the future."
"The first preserve the world and people it, the
second move the world and lead it to its goal."
"Each class has an equal
right to exist."
"In fact, all have equal rights with me--and _vive la
guerre éternelle_--till the New Jerusalem, of course!”

“Then you believe in the New Jerusalem, do you?”

“I do,” Raskolnikov answered firmly; as he said these words and during
the whole preceding tirade he kept his eyes on one spot on the carpet."
“And... and do you believe in God?
"Excuse my curiosity.”

“I do,” repeated Raskolnikov, raising his eyes to Porfiry."
"“And... do you believe in Lazarus’ rising from the dead?”

“I..."
I do.
"Why do you ask all this?”

“You believe it literally?”

“Literally.”

“You don’t say so...."
I asked from curiosity.
Excuse me.
"But let us
go back to the question; they are not always executed."
"Some, on the
contrary...”

“Triumph in their lifetime?"
"Oh, yes, some attain their ends in this
life, and then...”

“They begin executing other people?”

“If it’s necessary; indeed, for the most part they do."
"Your remark is
very witty.”

“Thank you."
"But tell me this: how do you distinguish those extraordinary
people from the ordinary ones?"
Are there signs at their birth?
"I feel
there ought to be more exactitude, more external definition."
"Excuse the
natural anxiety of a practical law-abiding citizen, but couldn’t they
adopt a special uniform, for instance, couldn’t they wear something, be
branded in some way?"
"For you know if confusion arises and a member of
one category imagines that he belongs to the other, begins to ‘eliminate
obstacles’ as you so happily expressed it, then...”

“Oh, that very often happens!"
"That remark is wittier than the other.”

“Thank you.”

“No reason to; but take note that the mistake can only arise in
the first category, that is among the ordinary people (as I perhaps
unfortunately called them)."
"In spite of their predisposition to
obedience very many of them, through a playfulness of nature, sometimes
vouchsafed even to the cow, like to imagine themselves advanced people,
‘destroyers,’ and to push themselves into the ‘new movement,’ and
this quite sincerely."
"Meanwhile the really _new_ people are very often
unobserved by them, or even despised as reactionaries of grovelling
tendencies."
"But I don’t think there is any considerable danger here,
and you really need not be uneasy for they never go very far."
"Of course,
they might have a thrashing sometimes for letting their fancy run away
with them and to teach them their place, but no more; in fact, even
this isn’t necessary as they castigate themselves, for they are very
conscientious: some perform this service for one another and others
chastise themselves with their own hands...."
"They will impose various
public acts of penitence upon themselves with a beautiful and edifying
effect; in fact you’ve nothing to be uneasy about.... It’s a law of
nature.”

“Well, you have certainly set my mind more at rest on that score; but
there’s another thing worries me."
"Tell me, please, are there many people
who have the right to kill others, these extraordinary people?"
"I am
ready to bow down to them, of course, but you must admit it’s alarming
if there are a great many of them, eh?”

“Oh, you needn’t worry about that either,” Raskolnikov went on in the
same tone."
"“People with new ideas, people with the faintest capacity for
saying something _new_, are extremely few in number, extraordinarily
so in fact."
"One thing only is clear, that the appearance of all these
grades and sub-divisions of men must follow with unfailing regularity
some law of nature."
"That law, of course, is unknown at present, but I am
convinced that it exists, and one day may become known."
"The vast mass of
mankind is mere material, and only exists in order by some great effort,
by some mysterious process, by means of some crossing of races and
stocks, to bring into the world at last perhaps one man out of a
thousand with a spark of independence."
"One in ten thousand perhaps--I
speak roughly, approximately--is born with some independence, and with
still greater independence one in a hundred thousand."
"The man of genius
is one of millions, and the great geniuses, the crown of humanity,
appear on earth perhaps one in many thousand millions."
"In fact I have
not peeped into the retort in which all this takes place."
"But there
certainly is and must be a definite law, it cannot be a matter of
chance.”

“Why, are you both joking?” Razumihin cried at last."
"“There you sit,
making fun of one another."
"Are you serious, Rodya?”

Raskolnikov raised his pale and almost mournful face and made no reply."
"And the unconcealed, persistent, nervous, and _discourteous_ sarcasm of
Porfiry seemed strange to Razumihin beside that quiet and mournful face."
"“Well, brother, if you are really serious... You are right, of course,
in saying that it’s not new, that it’s like what we’ve read and heard a
thousand times already; but what is really original in all this, and is
exclusively your own, to my horror, is that you sanction bloodshed
_in the name of conscience_, and, excuse my saying so, with such
fanaticism.... That, I take it, is the point of your article."
"But that
sanction of bloodshed _by conscience_ is to my mind... more terrible
than the official, legal sanction of bloodshed....”

“You are quite right, it is more terrible,” Porfiry agreed."
"“Yes, you must have exaggerated!"
"There is some mistake, I shall read it."
You can’t think that!
"I shall read it.”

“All that is not in the article, there’s only a hint of it,” said
Raskolnikov."
"“Yes, yes.” Porfiry couldn’t sit still."
"“Your attitude to crime is
pretty clear to me now, but... excuse me for my impertinence (I am
really ashamed to be worrying you like this), you see, you’ve removed
my anxiety as to the two grades getting mixed, but... there are various
practical possibilities that make me uneasy!"
"What if some man or youth
imagines that he is a Lycurgus or Mahomet--a future one of course--and
suppose he begins to remove all obstacles...."
"He has some great
enterprise before him and needs money for it... and tries to get it...
do you see?”

Zametov gave a sudden guffaw in his corner."
"Raskolnikov did not even
raise his eyes to him."
"“I must admit,” he went on calmly, “that such cases certainly must
arise."
"The vain and foolish are particularly apt to fall into that
snare; young people especially.”

“Yes, you see."
"Well then?”

“What then?” Raskolnikov smiled in reply; “that’s not my fault."
"So it is
and so it always will be."
"He said just now (he nodded at Razumihin)
that I sanction bloodshed."
"Society is too well protected by prisons,
banishment, criminal investigators, penal servitude."
"There’s no need to
be uneasy."
"You have but to catch the thief.”

“And what if we do catch him?”

“Then he gets what he deserves.”

“You are certainly logical."
"But what of his conscience?”

“Why do you care about that?”

“Simply from humanity.”

“If he has a conscience he will suffer for his mistake."
"That will be his
punishment--as well as the prison.”

“But the real geniuses,” asked Razumihin frowning, “those who have
the right to murder?"
"Oughtn’t they to suffer at all even for the blood
they’ve shed?”

“Why the word _ought_?"
It’s not a matter of permission or prohibition.
He will suffer if he is sorry for his victim.
"Pain and suffering are
always inevitable for a large intelligence and a deep heart."
"The
really great men must, I think, have great sadness on earth,” he added
dreamily, not in the tone of the conversation."
"He raised his eyes, looked earnestly at them all, smiled, and took his
cap."
"He was too quiet by comparison with his manner at his entrance, and
he felt this."
Everyone got up.
"“Well, you may abuse me, be angry with me if you like,” Porfiry
Petrovitch began again, “but I can’t resist."
"Allow me one little
question (I know I am troubling you)."
"There is just one little notion I
want to express, simply that I may not forget it.”

“Very good, tell me your little notion,” Raskolnikov stood waiting, pale
and grave before him."
"“Well, you see..."
"I really don’t know how to express it properly....
It’s a playful, psychological idea...."
"When you were writing your
article, surely you couldn’t have helped, he-he!"
"fancying yourself...
just a little, an ‘extraordinary’ man, uttering a _new word_ in your
sense.... That’s so, isn’t it?”

“Quite possibly,” Raskolnikov answered contemptuously."
Razumihin made a movement.
"“And, if so, could you bring yourself in case of worldly difficulties
and hardship or for some service to humanity--to overstep obstacles?..."
"For instance, to rob and murder?”

And again he winked with his left eye, and laughed noiselessly just as
before."
"“If I did I certainly should not tell you,” Raskolnikov answered with
defiant and haughty contempt."
"“No, I was only interested on account of your article, from a literary
point of view...”

“Foo!"
"how obvious and insolent that is!” Raskolnikov thought with
repulsion."
"“Allow me to observe,” he answered dryly, “that I don’t consider myself
a Mahomet or a Napoleon, nor any personage of that kind, and not being
one of them I cannot tell you how I should act.”

“Oh, come, don’t we all think ourselves Napoleons now in Russia?”
 Porfiry Petrovitch said with alarming familiarity."
Something peculiar betrayed itself in the very intonation of his voice.
"“Perhaps it was one of these future Napoleons who did for Alyona
Ivanovna last week?” Zametov blurted out from the corner."
"Raskolnikov did not speak, but looked firmly and intently at Porfiry."
Razumihin was scowling gloomily.
"He seemed before this to be noticing
something."
He looked angrily around.
"There was a minute of gloomy
silence."
Raskolnikov turned to go.
"“Are you going already?” Porfiry said amiably, holding out his hand with
excessive politeness."
"“Very, very glad of your acquaintance."
"As for your
request, have no uneasiness, write just as I told you, or, better still,
come to me there yourself in a day or two... to-morrow, indeed."
"I shall
be there at eleven o’clock for certain."
"We’ll arrange it all; we’ll have
a talk."
"As one of the last to be _there_, you might perhaps be able to
tell us something,” he added with a most good-natured expression."
"“You want to cross-examine me officially in due form?” Raskolnikov asked
sharply."
"“Oh, why?"
That’s not necessary for the present.
You misunderstand me.
"I lose no opportunity, you see, and... I’ve talked with all who had
pledges...."
"I obtained evidence from some of them, and you are the
last...."
"Yes, by the way,” he cried, seemingly suddenly delighted, “I
just remember, what was I thinking of?” he turned to Razumihin, “you
were talking my ears off about that Nikolay... of course, I know, I know
very well,” he turned to Raskolnikov, “that the fellow is innocent, but
what is one to do?"
We had to trouble Dmitri too....
"This is the point,
this is all: when you went up the stairs it was past seven, wasn’t it?”

“Yes,” answered Raskolnikov, with an unpleasant sensation at the very
moment he spoke that he need not have said it."
"“Then when you went upstairs between seven and eight, didn’t you see in
a flat that stood open on a second storey, do you remember?"
"two workmen
or at least one of them?"
"They were painting there, didn’t you notice
them?"
"It’s very, very important for them.”

“Painters?"
"No, I didn’t see them,” Raskolnikov answered slowly, as
though ransacking his memory, while at the same instant he was racking
every nerve, almost swooning with anxiety to conjecture as quickly as
possible where the trap lay and not to overlook anything."
"“No, I didn’t
see them, and I don’t think I noticed a flat like that open...."
"But on
the fourth storey” (he had mastered the trap now and was triumphant)
“I remember now that someone was moving out of the flat opposite Alyona
Ivanovna’s...."
I remember...
I remember it clearly.
"Some porters
were carrying out a sofa and they squeezed me against the wall."
"But
painters... no, I don’t remember that there were any painters, and I
don’t think that there was a flat open anywhere, no, there wasn’t.”

“What do you mean?” Razumihin shouted suddenly, as though he had
reflected and realised."
"“Why, it was on the day of the murder the
painters were at work, and he was there three days before?"
"What are you
asking?”

“Foo!"
I have muddled it!” Porfiry slapped himself on the forehead.
“Deuce take it!
"This business is turning my brain!” he addressed
Raskolnikov somewhat apologetically."
"“It would be such a great thing for
us to find out whether anyone had seen them between seven and eight at
the flat, so I fancied you could perhaps have told us something...."
"I
quite muddled it.”

“Then you should be more careful,” Razumihin observed grimly."
The last words were uttered in the passage.
"Porfiry Petrovitch saw them
to the door with excessive politeness."
"They went out into the street gloomy and sullen, and for some steps they
did not say a word."
Raskolnikov drew a deep breath.
"CHAPTER VI

“I don’t believe it, I can’t believe it!” repeated Razumihin, trying in
perplexity to refute Raskolnikov’s arguments."
"They were by now approaching Bakaleyev’s lodgings, where Pulcheria
Alexandrovna and Dounia had been expecting them a long while."
"Razumihin
kept stopping on the way in the heat of discussion, confused and excited
by the very fact that they were for the first time speaking openly about
_it_."
"“Don’t believe it, then!” answered Raskolnikov, with a cold, careless
smile."
"“You were noticing nothing as usual, but I was weighing every
word.”

“You are suspicious."
"That is why you weighed their words... h’m...
certainly, I agree, Porfiry’s tone was rather strange, and still
more that wretch Zametov!..."
"You are right, there was something about
him--but why?"
"Why?”

“He has changed his mind since last night.”

“Quite the contrary!"
"If they had that brainless idea, they would do
their utmost to hide it, and conceal their cards, so as to catch you
afterwards...."
"But it was all impudent and careless.”

“If they had had facts--I mean, real facts--or at least grounds for
suspicion, then they would certainly have tried to hide their game,
in the hope of getting more (they would have made a search long ago
besides)."
"But they have no facts, not one."
"It is all mirage--all
ambiguous."
Simply a floating idea.
"So they try to throw me out by
impudence."
"And perhaps, he was irritated at having no facts, and blurted
it out in his vexation--or perhaps he has some plan... he seems an
intelligent man."
"Perhaps he wanted to frighten me by pretending to
know."
"They have a psychology of their own, brother."
"But it is loathsome
explaining it all."
"Stop!”

“And it’s insulting, insulting!"
I understand you.
"But... since we have
spoken openly now (and it is an excellent thing that we have at last--I
am glad) I will own now frankly that I noticed it in them long ago,
this idea."
"Of course the merest hint only--an insinuation--but why an
insinuation even?"
How dare they?
What foundation have they?
"If only you
knew how furious I have been."
Think only!
"Simply because a poor student,
unhinged by poverty and hypochondria, on the eve of a severe delirious
illness (note that), suspicious, vain, proud, who has not seen a soul to
speak to for six months, in rags and in boots without soles, has to
face some wretched policemen and put up with their insolence; and
the unexpected debt thrust under his nose, the I.O.U."
"presented
by Tchebarov, the new paint, thirty degrees Reaumur and a stifling
atmosphere, a crowd of people, the talk about the murder of a person
where he had been just before, and all that on an empty stomach--he
might well have a fainting fit!"
"And that, that is what they found it
all on!"
Damn them!
"I understand how annoying it is, but in your place,
Rodya, I would laugh at them, or better still, spit in their ugly faces,
and spit a dozen times in all directions."
"I’d hit out in all
directions, neatly too, and so I’d put an end to it."
Damn them!
"Don’t be
downhearted."
"It’s a shame!”

“He really has put it well, though,” Raskolnikov thought."
“Damn them?
"But the cross-examination again, to-morrow?” he said with
bitterness."
“Must I really enter into explanations with them?
"I feel
vexed as it is, that I condescended to speak to Zametov yesterday in the
restaurant....”

“Damn it!"
I will go myself to Porfiry.
"I will squeeze it out of him, as
one of the family: he must let me know the ins and outs of it all!"
"And
as for Zametov...”

“At last he sees through him!” thought Raskolnikov."
"“Stay!” cried Razumihin, seizing him by the shoulder again."
“Stay!
"you
were wrong."
I have thought it out.
You are wrong!
How was that a trap?
You say that the question about the workmen was a trap.
"But if you had
done _that_, could you have said you had seen them painting the flat...
and the workmen?"
"On the contrary, you would have seen nothing, even if
you had seen it."
"Who would own it against himself?”

“If I had done _that thing_, I should certainly have said that I had
seen the workmen and the flat,” Raskolnikov answered, with reluctance
and obvious disgust."
"“But why speak against yourself?”

“Because only peasants, or the most inexperienced novices deny
everything flatly at examinations."
"If a man is ever so little developed
and experienced, he will certainly try to admit all the external facts
that can’t be avoided, but will seek other explanations of them, will
introduce some special, unexpected turn, that will give them another
significance and put them in another light."
"Porfiry might well reckon
that I should be sure to answer so, and say I had seen them to give an
air of truth, and then make some explanation.”

“But he would have told you at once that the workmen could not have been
there two days before, and that therefore you must have been there on
the day of the murder at eight o’clock."
"And so he would have caught you
over a detail.”

“Yes, that is what he was reckoning on, that I should not have time to
reflect, and should be in a hurry to make the most likely answer, and
so would forget that the workmen could not have been there two days
before.”

“But how could you forget it?”

“Nothing easier."
"It is in just such stupid things clever people are most
easily caught."
"The more cunning a man is, the less he suspects that he
will be caught in a simple thing."
"The more cunning a man is, the simpler
the trap he must be caught in."
"Porfiry is not such a fool as you
think....”

“He is a knave then, if that is so!”

Raskolnikov could not help laughing."
"But at the very moment, he was
struck by the strangeness of his own frankness, and the eagerness
with which he had made this explanation, though he had kept up all the
preceding conversation with gloomy repulsion, obviously with a motive,
from necessity."
“I am getting a relish for certain aspects!” he thought to himself.
"But almost at the same instant he became suddenly uneasy, as though an
unexpected and alarming idea had occurred to him."
"His uneasiness kept on
increasing."
They had just reached the entrance to Bakaleyev’s.
“Go in alone!” said Raskolnikov suddenly.
"“I will be back directly.”

“Where are you going?"
"Why, we are just here.”

“I can’t help it...."
I will come in half an hour.
"Tell them.”

“Say what you like, I will come with you.”

“You, too, want to torture me!” he screamed, with such bitter
irritation, such despair in his eyes that Razumihin’s hands dropped."
"He stood for some time on the steps, looking gloomily at Raskolnikov
striding rapidly away in the direction of his lodging."
"At last, gritting
his teeth and clenching his fist, he swore he would squeeze Porfiry
like a lemon that very day, and went up the stairs to reassure Pulcheria
Alexandrovna, who was by now alarmed at their long absence."
"When Raskolnikov got home, his hair was soaked with sweat and he was
breathing heavily."
"He went rapidly up the stairs, walked into his
unlocked room and at once fastened the latch."
"Then in senseless terror
he rushed to the corner, to that hole under the paper where he had put
the things; put his hand in, and for some minutes felt carefully in the
hole, in every crack and fold of the paper."
"Finding nothing, he got up
and drew a deep breath."
"As he was reaching the steps of Bakaleyev’s, he
suddenly fancied that something, a chain, a stud or even a bit of paper
in which they had been wrapped with the old woman’s handwriting on it,
might somehow have slipped out and been lost in some crack, and then
might suddenly turn up as unexpected, conclusive evidence against him."
"He stood as though lost in thought, and a strange, humiliated, half
senseless smile strayed on his lips."
"He took his cap at last and went
quietly out of the room."
His ideas were all tangled.
"He went dreamily
through the gateway."
"“Here he is himself,” shouted a loud voice."
He raised his head.
"The porter was standing at the door of his little room and was pointing
him out to a short man who looked like an artisan, wearing a long coat
and a waistcoat, and looking at a distance remarkably like a woman."
"He
stooped, and his head in a greasy cap hung forward."
"From his wrinkled
flabby face he looked over fifty; his little eyes were lost in fat and
they looked out grimly, sternly and discontentedly."
"“What is it?” Raskolnikov asked, going up to the porter."
"The man stole a look at him from under his brows and he looked at him
attentively, deliberately; then he turned slowly and went out of the
gate into the street without saying a word."
“What is it?” cried Raskolnikov.
"“Why, he there was asking whether a student lived here, mentioned your
name and whom you lodged with."
"I saw you coming and pointed you out and
he went away."
"It’s funny.”

The porter too seemed rather puzzled, but not much so, and after
wondering for a moment he turned and went back to his room."
"Raskolnikov ran after the stranger, and at once caught sight of
him walking along the other side of the street with the same even,
deliberate step with his eyes fixed on the ground, as though in
meditation."
"He soon overtook him, but for some time walked behind him."
"At last, moving on to a level with him, he looked at his face."
"The man
noticed him at once, looked at him quickly, but dropped his eyes again;
and so they walked for a minute side by side without uttering a word."
"“You were inquiring for me... of the porter?” Raskolnikov said at last,
but in a curiously quiet voice."
The man made no answer; he didn’t even look at him.
"Again they were both
silent."
"“Why do you... come and ask for me... and say nothing.... What’s the
meaning of it?”

Raskolnikov’s voice broke and he seemed unable to articulate the words
clearly."
"The man raised his eyes this time and turned a gloomy sinister look at
Raskolnikov."
“Murderer!” he said suddenly in a quiet but clear and distinct voice.
Raskolnikov went on walking beside him.
"His legs felt suddenly weak, a
cold shiver ran down his spine, and his heart seemed to stand still for
a moment, then suddenly began throbbing as though it were set free."
"So
they walked for about a hundred paces, side by side in silence."
The man did not look at him.
"“What do you mean... what is.... Who is a murderer?” muttered
Raskolnikov hardly audibly."
"“_You_ are a murderer,” the man answered still more articulately and
emphatically, with a smile of triumphant hatred, and again he looked
straight into Raskolnikov’s pale face and stricken eyes."
They had just reached the cross-roads.
"The man turned to the left
without looking behind him."
"Raskolnikov remained standing, gazing after
him."
"He saw him turn round fifty paces away and look back at him still
standing there."
"Raskolnikov could not see clearly, but he fancied that
he was again smiling the same smile of cold hatred and triumph."
"With slow faltering steps, with shaking knees, Raskolnikov made his way
back to his little garret, feeling chilled all over."
"He took off his cap
and put it on the table, and for ten minutes he stood without moving."
"Then he sank exhausted on the sofa and with a weak moan of pain he
stretched himself on it."
So he lay for half an hour.
He thought of nothing.
"Some thoughts or fragments of thoughts, some
images without order or coherence floated before his mind--faces of
people he had seen in his childhood or met somewhere once, whom he would
never have recalled, the belfry of the church at V., the billiard table
in a restaurant and some officers playing billiards, the smell of cigars
in some underground tobacco shop, a tavern room, a back staircase quite
dark, all sloppy with dirty water and strewn with egg-shells, and the
Sunday bells floating in from somewhere...."
"The images followed one
another, whirling like a hurricane."
"Some of them he liked and tried
to clutch at, but they faded and all the while there was an oppression
within him, but it was not overwhelming, sometimes it was even
pleasant...."
"The slight shivering still persisted, but that too
was an almost pleasant sensation."
"He heard the hurried footsteps of Razumihin; he closed his eyes and
pretended to be asleep."
"Razumihin opened the door and stood for some
time in the doorway as though hesitating, then he stepped softly into
the room and went cautiously to the sofa."
"Raskolnikov heard Nastasya’s
whisper:

“Don’t disturb him!"
Let him sleep.
"He can have his dinner later.”

“Quite so,” answered Razumihin."
"Both withdrew carefully and closed the
door."
Another half-hour passed.
"Raskolnikov opened his eyes, turned on
his back again, clasping his hands behind his head."
“Who is he?
Who is that man who sprang out of the earth?
"Where was he,
what did he see?"
"He has seen it all, that’s clear."
Where was he then?
And from where did he see?
Why has he only now sprung out of the earth?
And how could he see?
Is it possible?
"Hm...” continued Raskolnikov,
turning cold and shivering, “and the jewel case Nikolay found behind the
door--was that possible?"
A clue?
"You miss an infinitesimal line and you
can build it into a pyramid of evidence!"
A fly flew by and saw it!
"Is it
possible?” He felt with sudden loathing how weak, how physically weak he
had become."
"“I ought to have known it,” he thought with a bitter smile."
"“And how dared I, knowing myself, knowing how I should be, take up an
axe and shed blood!"
"I ought to have known beforehand.... Ah, but I did
know!” he whispered in despair."
"At times he came to a standstill at some
thought."
"“No, those men are not made so."
"The real _Master_ to whom all is
permitted storms Toulon, makes a massacre in Paris, _forgets_ an army in
Egypt, _wastes_ half a million men in the Moscow expedition and gets off
with a jest at Vilna."
"And altars are set up to him after his death, and
so _all_ is permitted."
"No, such people, it seems, are not of flesh but
of bronze!”

One sudden irrelevant idea almost made him laugh."
"Napoleon, the
pyramids, Waterloo, and a wretched skinny old woman, a pawnbroker with
a red trunk under her bed--it’s a nice hash for Porfiry Petrovitch to
digest!"
How can they digest it!
It’s too inartistic.
"“A Napoleon creep
under an old woman’s bed!"
"Ugh, how loathsome!”

At moments he felt he was raving."
"He sank into a state of feverish
excitement."
"“The old woman is of no consequence,” he thought, hotly and
incoherently."
"“The old woman was a mistake perhaps, but she is not
what matters!"
The old woman was only an illness....
"I was in a hurry to
overstep...."
"I didn’t kill a human being, but a principle!"
"I killed the
principle, but I didn’t overstep, I stopped on this side...."
"I was
only capable of killing."
And it seems I wasn’t even capable of that...
Principle?
Why was that fool Razumihin abusing the socialists?
"They are
industrious, commercial people; ‘the happiness of all’ is their case."
"No, life is only given to me once and I shall never have it again; I
don’t want to wait for ‘the happiness of all.’ I want to live myself,
or else better not live at all."
"I simply couldn’t pass by my mother
starving, keeping my rouble in my pocket while I waited for the
‘happiness of all.’ I am putting my little brick into the happiness of
all and so my heart is at peace."
Ha-ha!
Why have you let me slip?
"I only
live once, I too want.... Ech, I am an æsthetic louse and nothing
more,” he added suddenly, laughing like a madman."
"“Yes, I am certainly a
louse,” he went on, clutching at the idea, gloating over it and playing
with it with vindictive pleasure."
"“In the first place, because I can
reason that I am one, and secondly, because for a month past I have been
troubling benevolent Providence, calling it to witness that not for
my own fleshly lusts did I undertake it, but with a grand and noble
object--ha-ha!"
"Thirdly, because I aimed at carrying it out as justly as
possible, weighing, measuring and calculating."
"Of all the lice I picked
out the most useless one and proposed to take from her only as much as I
needed for the first step, no more nor less (so the rest would have gone
to a monastery, according to her will, ha-ha!)."
"And what shows that I
am utterly a louse,” he added, grinding his teeth, “is that I am
perhaps viler and more loathsome than the louse I killed, and _I felt
beforehand_ that I should tell myself so _after_ killing her."
"Can
anything be compared with the horror of that?"
The vulgarity!
"The
abjectness!"
"I understand the ‘prophet’ with his sabre, on his steed:
Allah commands and ‘trembling’ creation must obey!"
"The ‘prophet’ is
right, he is right when he sets a battery across the street and blows up
the innocent and the guilty without deigning to explain!"
"It’s for you to
obey, trembling creation, and not _to have desires_, for that’s not for
you!..."
"I shall never, never forgive the old woman!”

His hair was soaked with sweat, his quivering lips were parched, his
eyes were fixed on the ceiling."
"“Mother, sister--how I loved them!"
Why do I hate them now?
"Yes, I hate
them, I feel a physical hatred for them, I can’t bear them near me...."
"I went up to my mother and kissed her, I remember.... To embrace her
and think if she only knew... shall I tell her then?"
"That’s just what
I might do.... _She_ must be the same as I am,” he added, straining
himself to think, as it were struggling with delirium."
"“Ah, how I hate
the old woman now!"
I feel I should kill her again if she came to life!
Poor Lizaveta!
Why did she come in?...
"It’s strange though, why is it
I scarcely ever think of her, as though I hadn’t killed her?"
Lizaveta!
Sonia!
"Poor gentle things, with gentle eyes.... Dear women!"
"Why don’t
they weep?"
Why don’t they moan?
"They give up everything... their eyes
are soft and gentle.... Sonia, Sonia!"
"Gentle Sonia!”

He lost consciousness; it seemed strange to him that he didn’t remember
how he got into the street."
It was late evening.
"The twilight had fallen
and the full moon was shining more and more brightly; but there was a
peculiar breathlessness in the air."
"There were crowds of people in the
street; workmen and business people were making their way home; other
people had come out for a walk; there was a smell of mortar, dust and
stagnant water."
"Raskolnikov walked along, mournful and anxious; he was
distinctly aware of having come out with a purpose, of having to do
something in a hurry, but what it was he had forgotten."
"Suddenly he
stood still and saw a man standing on the other side of the street,
beckoning to him."
"He crossed over to him, but at once the man turned and
walked away with his head hanging, as though he had made no sign to
him."
"“Stay, did he really beckon?” Raskolnikov wondered, but he tried
to overtake him."
"When he was within ten paces he recognised him and
was frightened; it was the same man with stooping shoulders in the long
coat."
"Raskolnikov followed him at a distance; his heart was beating;
they went down a turning; the man still did not look round."
"“Does he
know I am following him?” thought Raskolnikov."
"The man went into the
gateway of a big house."
"Raskolnikov hastened to the gate and looked in
to see whether he would look round and sign to him."
"In the court-yard
the man did turn round and again seemed to beckon him."
"Raskolnikov at
once followed him into the yard, but the man was gone."
"He must have
gone up the first staircase."
Raskolnikov rushed after him.
"He heard
slow measured steps two flights above."
"The staircase seemed strangely
familiar."
"He reached the window on the first floor; the moon shone
through the panes with a melancholy and mysterious light; then he
reached the second floor."
Bah!
"this is the flat where the painters were
at work... but how was it he did not recognise it at once?"
"The steps
of the man above had died away."
"“So he must have stopped or hidden
somewhere.” He reached the third storey, should he go on?"
"There was a
stillness that was dreadful...."
But he went on.
"The sound of his own
footsteps scared and frightened him."
How dark it was!
"The man must be
hiding in some corner here."
Ah!
"the flat was standing wide open, he
hesitated and went in."
"It was very dark and empty in the passage, as
though everything had been removed; he crept on tiptoe into the parlour
which was flooded with moonlight."
"Everything there was as before, the
chairs, the looking-glass, the yellow sofa and the pictures in the
frames."
"A huge, round, copper-red moon looked in at the windows."
"“It’s the moon that makes it so still, weaving some mystery,” thought
Raskolnikov."
"He stood and waited, waited a long while, and the more
silent the moonlight, the more violently his heart beat, till it was
painful."
And still the same hush.
"Suddenly he heard a momentary sharp
crack like the snapping of a splinter and all was still again."
"A fly
flew up suddenly and struck the window pane with a plaintive buzz."
"At
that moment he noticed in the corner between the window and the little
cupboard something like a cloak hanging on the wall."
"“Why is that cloak
here?” he thought, “it wasn’t there before....” He went up to it quietly
and felt that there was someone hiding behind it."
"He cautiously moved
the cloak and saw, sitting on a chair in the corner, the old woman bent
double so that he couldn’t see her face; but it was she."
"He stood over
her."
"“She is afraid,” he thought."
"He stealthily took the axe from the
noose and struck her one blow, then another on the skull."
"But strange
to say she did not stir, as though she were made of wood."
"He was
frightened, bent down nearer and tried to look at her; but she, too,
bent her head lower."
"He bent right down to the ground and peeped up
into her face from below, he peeped and turned cold with horror: the old
woman was sitting and laughing, shaking with noiseless laughter, doing
her utmost that he should not hear it."
"Suddenly he fancied that the door
from the bedroom was opened a little and that there was laughter and
whispering within."
"He was overcome with frenzy and he began hitting the
old woman on the head with all his force, but at every blow of the axe
the laughter and whispering from the bedroom grew louder and the old
woman was simply shaking with mirth."
"He was rushing away, but the
passage was full of people, the doors of the flats stood open and on the
landing, on the stairs and everywhere below there were people, rows of
heads, all looking, but huddled together in silence and expectation."
"Something gripped his heart, his legs were rooted to the spot, they
would not move...."
He tried to scream and woke up.
"He drew a deep breath--but his dream seemed strangely to persist:
his door was flung open and a man whom he had never seen stood in the
doorway watching him intently."
"Raskolnikov had hardly opened his eyes and he instantly closed them
again."
He lay on his back without stirring.
"“Is it still a dream?” he wondered and again raised his eyelids hardly
perceptibly; the stranger was standing in the same place, still watching
him."
"He stepped cautiously into the room, carefully closing the door after
him, went up to the table, paused a moment, still keeping his eyes on
Raskolnikov, and noiselessly seated himself on the chair by the sofa; he
put his hat on the floor beside him and leaned his hands on his cane
and his chin on his hands."
"It was evident that he was prepared to wait
indefinitely."
"As far as Raskolnikov could make out from his stolen
glances, he was a man no longer young, stout, with a full, fair, almost
whitish beard."
Ten minutes passed.
"It was still light, but beginning to get dusk."
"There
was complete stillness in the room."
Not a sound came from the stairs.
Only a big fly buzzed and fluttered against the window pane.
"It was
unbearable at last."
Raskolnikov suddenly got up and sat on the sofa.
"“Come, tell me what you want.”

“I knew you were not asleep, but only pretending,” the stranger answered
oddly, laughing calmly."
"“Arkady Ivanovitch Svidrigaïlov, allow me to
introduce myself....”




PART IV



CHAPTER I

“Can this be still a dream?” Raskolnikov thought once more."
He looked carefully and suspiciously at the unexpected visitor.
“Svidrigaïlov!
What nonsense!
"It can’t be!” he said at last aloud in
bewilderment."
His visitor did not seem at all surprised at this exclamation.
“I’ve come to you for two reasons.
"In the first place, I wanted to make
your personal acquaintance, as I have already heard a great deal about
you that is interesting and flattering; secondly, I cherish the hope
that you may not refuse to assist me in a matter directly concerning the
welfare of your sister, Avdotya Romanovna."
"For without your support she
might not let me come near her now, for she is prejudiced against me,
but with your assistance I reckon on...”

“You reckon wrongly,” interrupted Raskolnikov."
"“They only arrived yesterday, may I ask you?”

Raskolnikov made no reply."
"“It was yesterday, I know."
I only arrived myself the day before.
"Well,
let me tell you this, Rodion Romanovitch, I don’t consider it necessary
to justify myself, but kindly tell me what was there particularly
criminal on my part in all this business, speaking without prejudice,
with common sense?”

Raskolnikov continued to look at him in silence."
"“That in my own house I persecuted a defenceless girl and ‘insulted her
with my infamous proposals’--is that it?"
(I am anticipating you.)
"But
you’ve only to assume that I, too, am a man _et nihil humanum_... in a
word, that I am capable of being attracted and falling in love (which
does not depend on our will), then everything can be explained in the
most natural manner."
"The question is, am I a monster, or am I myself
a victim?"
And what if I am a victim?
"In proposing to the object of my
passion to elope with me to America or Switzerland, I may have cherished
the deepest respect for her and may have thought that I was promoting
our mutual happiness!"
"Reason is the slave of passion, you know; why,
probably, I was doing more harm to myself than anyone!”

“But that’s not the point,” Raskolnikov interrupted with disgust."
"“It’s
simply that whether you are right or wrong, we dislike you."
"We don’t
want to have anything to do with you."
We show you the door.
"Go out!”

Svidrigaïlov broke into a sudden laugh."
"“But you’re... but there’s no getting round you,” he said, laughing in
the frankest way."
"“I hoped to get round you, but you took up the right
line at once!”

“But you are trying to get round me still!”

“What of it?"
"What of it?” cried Svidrigaïlov, laughing openly."
"“But this
is what the French call _bonne guerre_, and the most innocent form of
deception!..."
"But still you have interrupted me; one way or another, I
repeat again: there would never have been any unpleasantness except for
what happened in the garden."
"Marfa Petrovna...”

“You have got rid of Marfa Petrovna, too, so they say?” Raskolnikov
interrupted rudely."
"“Oh, you’ve heard that, too, then?"
"You’d be sure to, though...."
"But
as for your question, I really don’t know what to say, though my own
conscience is quite at rest on that score."
"Don’t suppose that I am in
any apprehension about it."
"All was regular and in order; the medical
inquiry diagnosed apoplexy due to bathing immediately after a heavy
dinner and a bottle of wine, and indeed it could have proved nothing
else."
"But I’ll tell you what I have been thinking to myself of late, on
my way here in the train, especially: didn’t I contribute to all that...
calamity, morally, in a way, by irritation or something of the
sort."
"But I came to the conclusion that that, too, was quite out of the
question.”

Raskolnikov laughed."
"“I wonder you trouble yourself about it!”

“But what are you laughing at?"
"Only consider, I struck her just twice
with a switch--there were no marks even... don’t regard me as a cynic,
please; I am perfectly aware how atrocious it was of me and all that;
but I know for certain, too, that Marfa Petrovna was very likely pleased
at my, so to say, warmth."
"The story of your sister had been wrung out to
the last drop; for the last three days Marfa Petrovna had been forced to
sit at home; she had nothing to show herself with in the town."
"Besides,
she had bored them so with that letter (you heard about her reading the
letter)."
And all of a sudden those two switches fell from heaven!
"Her
first act was to order the carriage to be got out.... Not to speak
of the fact that there are cases when women are very, very glad to be
insulted in spite of all their show of indignation."
"There are instances
of it with everyone; human beings in general, indeed, greatly love to
be insulted, have you noticed that?"
But it’s particularly so with women.
"One might even say it’s their only amusement.”

At one time Raskolnikov thought of getting up and walking out and so
finishing the interview."
"But some curiosity and even a sort of prudence
made him linger for a moment."
“You are fond of fighting?” he asked carelessly.
"“No, not very,” Svidrigaïlov answered, calmly."
"“And Marfa Petrovna and
I scarcely ever fought."
"We lived very harmoniously, and she was always
pleased with me."
"I only used the whip twice in all our seven years (not
counting a third occasion of a very ambiguous character)."
"The first
time, two months after our marriage, immediately after we arrived in the
country, and the last time was that of which we are speaking."
"Did you
suppose I was such a monster, such a reactionary, such a slave driver?"
"Ha, ha!"
"By the way, do you remember, Rodion Romanovitch, how a few years
ago, in those days of beneficent publicity, a nobleman, I’ve forgotten
his name, was put to shame everywhere, in all the papers, for having
thrashed a German woman in the railway train."
You remember?
"It was in
those days, that very year I believe, the ‘disgraceful action of the
_Age_’ took place (you know, ‘The Egyptian Nights,’ that public reading,
you remember?"
"The dark eyes, you know!"
"Ah, the golden days of our youth,
where are they?)."
"Well, as for the gentleman who thrashed the German,
I feel no sympathy with him, because after all what need is there
for sympathy?"
"But I must say that there are sometimes such provoking
‘Germans’ that I don’t believe there is a progressive who could quite
answer for himself."
"No one looked at the subject from that point of view
then, but that’s the truly humane point of view, I assure you.”

After saying this, Svidrigaïlov broke into a sudden laugh again."
"Raskolnikov saw clearly that this was a man with a firm purpose in his
mind and able to keep it to himself."
“I expect you’ve not talked to anyone for some days?” he asked.
“Scarcely anyone.
"I suppose you are wondering at my being such an
adaptable man?”

“No, I am only wondering at your being too adaptable a man.”

“Because I am not offended at the rudeness of your questions?"
"Is that
it?"
But why take offence?
"As you asked, so I answered,” he replied,
with a surprising expression of simplicity."
"“You know, there’s
hardly anything I take interest in,” he went on, as it were dreamily,
“especially now, I’ve nothing to do.... You are quite at liberty to
imagine though that I am making up to you with a motive, particularly as
I told you I want to see your sister about something."
"But I’ll confess
frankly, I am very much bored."
"The last three days especially, so I am
delighted to see you.... Don’t be angry, Rodion Romanovitch, but you
seem to be somehow awfully strange yourself."
"Say what you like, there’s
something wrong with you, and now, too... not this very minute, I mean,
but now, generally.... Well, well, I won’t, I won’t, don’t scowl!"
"I am
not such a bear, you know, as you think.”

Raskolnikov looked gloomily at him."
"“You are not a bear, perhaps, at all,” he said."
"“I fancy indeed that
you are a man of very good breeding, or at least know how on occasion to
behave like one.”

“I am not particularly interested in anyone’s opinion,” Svidrigaïlov
answered, dryly and even with a shade of haughtiness, “and therefore why
not be vulgar at times when vulgarity is such a convenient cloak for our
climate... and especially if one has a natural propensity that way,” he
added, laughing again."
“But I’ve heard you have many friends here.
"You are, as they say, ‘not
without connections.’ What can you want with me, then, unless you’ve
some special object?”

“That’s true that I have friends here,” Svidrigaïlov admitted, not
replying to the chief point."
“I’ve met some already.
"I’ve been lounging
about for the last three days, and I’ve seen them, or they’ve seen me."
That’s a matter of course.
"I am well dressed and reckoned not a poor
man; the emancipation of the serfs hasn’t affected me; my property
consists chiefly of forests and water meadows."
"The revenue has not
fallen off; but..."
"I am not going to see them, I was sick of them long
ago."
"I’ve been here three days and have called on no one.... What a town
it is!"
"How has it come into existence among us, tell me that?"
"A town of
officials and students of all sorts."
"Yes, there’s a great deal I didn’t
notice when I was here eight years ago, kicking up my heels.... My only
hope now is in anatomy, by Jove, it is!”

“Anatomy?”

“But as for these clubs, Dussauts, parades, or progress, indeed,
maybe--well, all that can go on without me,” he went on, again without
noticing the question."
"“Besides, who wants to be a card-sharper?”

“Why, have you been a card-sharper then?”

“How could I help being?"
"There was a regular set of us, men of the best
society, eight years ago; we had a fine time."
"And all men of breeding,
you know, poets, men of property."
"And indeed as a rule in our Russian
society the best manners are found among those who’ve been thrashed,
have you noticed that?"
I’ve deteriorated in the country.
"But I did get
into prison for debt, through a low Greek who came from Nezhin."
"Then
Marfa Petrovna turned up; she bargained with him and bought me off for
thirty thousand silver pieces (I owed seventy thousand)."
"We were united
in lawful wedlock and she bore me off into the country like a treasure."
You know she was five years older than I.
She was very fond of me.
"For
seven years I never left the country."
"And, take note, that all my life
she held a document over me, the IOU for thirty thousand roubles, so
if I were to elect to be restive about anything I should be trapped at
once!"
And she would have done it!
"Women find nothing incompatible in
that.”

“If it hadn’t been for that, would you have given her the slip?”

“I don’t know what to say."
It was scarcely the document restrained me.
"I
didn’t want to go anywhere else."
"Marfa Petrovna herself invited me to go
abroad, seeing I was bored, but I’ve been abroad before, and always
felt sick there."
"For no reason, but the sunrise, the bay of Naples, the
sea--you look at them and it makes you sad."
"What’s most revolting is
that one is really sad!"
"No, it’s better at home."
"Here at least one
blames others for everything and excuses oneself."
"I should have gone
perhaps on an expedition to the North Pole, because _j’ai le vin
mauvais_ and hate drinking, and there’s nothing left but wine."
"I have
tried it."
"But, I say, I’ve been told Berg is going up in a great balloon
next Sunday from the Yusupov Garden and will take up passengers at a
fee."
"Is it true?”

“Why, would you go up?”

“I... No, oh, no,” muttered Svidrigaïlov really seeming to be deep in
thought."
“What does he mean?
Is he in earnest?” Raskolnikov wondered.
"“No, the document didn’t restrain me,” Svidrigaïlov went on,
meditatively."
"“It was my own doing, not leaving the country, and nearly
a year ago Marfa Petrovna gave me back the document on my name-day
and made me a present of a considerable sum of money, too."
"She had a
fortune, you know."
"‘You see how I trust you, Arkady Ivanovitch’--that
was actually her expression."
You don’t believe she used it?
"But do
you know I managed the estate quite decently, they know me in the
neighbourhood."
"I ordered books, too."
"Marfa Petrovna at first approved,
but afterwards she was afraid of my over-studying.”

“You seem to be missing Marfa Petrovna very much?”

“Missing her?"
Perhaps.
"Really, perhaps I am."
"And, by the way, do you
believe in ghosts?”

“What ghosts?”

“Why, ordinary ghosts.”

“Do you believe in them?”

“Perhaps not, _pour vous plaire_...."
"I wouldn’t say no exactly.”

“Do you see them, then?”

Svidrigaïlov looked at him rather oddly."
"“Marfa Petrovna is pleased to visit me,” he said, twisting his mouth
into a strange smile."
"“How do you mean ‘she is pleased to visit you’?”

“She has been three times."
"I saw her first on the very day of the
funeral, an hour after she was buried."
"It was the day before I left to
come here."
"The second time was the day before yesterday, at daybreak, on
the journey at the station of Malaya Vishera, and the third time was two
hours ago in the room where I am staying."
"I was alone.”

“Were you awake?”

“Quite awake."
I was wide awake every time.
"She comes, speaks to me for
a minute and goes out at the door--always at the door."
"I can almost hear
her.”

“What made me think that something of the sort must be happening to
you?” Raskolnikov said suddenly."
At the same moment he was surprised at having said it.
"He was much
excited."
“What!
Did you think so?” Svidrigaïlov asked in astonishment.
"“Did you
really?"
"Didn’t I say that there was something in common between us, eh?”

“You never said so!” Raskolnikov cried sharply and with heat."
"“Didn’t I?”

“No!”

“I thought I did."
"When I came in and saw you lying with your eyes shut,
pretending, I said to myself at once, ‘Here’s the man.’”

“What do you mean by ‘the man?’ What are you talking about?” cried
Raskolnikov."
“What do I mean?
"I really don’t know....” Svidrigaïlov muttered
ingenuously, as though he, too, were puzzled."
For a minute they were silent.
They stared in each other’s faces.
“That’s all nonsense!” Raskolnikov shouted with vexation.
"“What does she
say when she comes to you?”

“She!"
"Would you believe it, she talks of the silliest trifles and--man
is a strange creature--it makes me angry."
"The first time she came in (I
was tired you know: the funeral service, the funeral ceremony, the lunch
afterwards."
At last I was left alone in my study.
"I lighted a cigar and
began to think), she came in at the door."
"‘You’ve been so busy to-day,
Arkady Ivanovitch, you have forgotten to wind the dining-room clock,’
she said."
"All those seven years I’ve wound that clock every week, and if
I forgot it she would always remind me."
"The next day I set off on my way
here."
"I got out at the station at daybreak; I’d been asleep, tired out,
with my eyes half open, I was drinking some coffee."
"I looked up and
there was suddenly Marfa Petrovna sitting beside me with a pack of
cards in her hands."
"‘Shall I tell your fortune for the journey, Arkady
Ivanovitch?’ She was a great hand at telling fortunes."
"I shall never
forgive myself for not asking her to."
"I ran away in a fright, and,
besides, the bell rang."
"I was sitting to-day, feeling very heavy after a
miserable dinner from a cookshop; I was sitting smoking, all of a sudden
Marfa Petrovna again."
"She came in very smart in a new green silk dress
with a long train."
"‘Good day, Arkady Ivanovitch!"
"How do you like my
dress?"
"Aniska can’t make like this.’ (Aniska was a dressmaker in the
country, one of our former serf girls who had been trained in Moscow, a
pretty wench.)"
She stood turning round before me.
"I looked at the dress,
and then I looked carefully, very carefully, at her face."
"‘I wonder
you trouble to come to me about such trifles, Marfa Petrovna.’ ‘Good
gracious, you won’t let one disturb you about anything!’ To tease her
I said, ‘I want to get married, Marfa Petrovna.’ ‘That’s just like you,
Arkady Ivanovitch; it does you very little credit to come looking for a
bride when you’ve hardly buried your wife."
"And if you could make a good
choice, at least, but I know it won’t be for your happiness or hers, you
will only be a laughing-stock to all good people.’ Then she went out and
her train seemed to rustle."
"Isn’t it nonsense, eh?”

“But perhaps you are telling lies?” Raskolnikov put in."
"“I rarely lie,” answered Svidrigaïlov thoughtfully, apparently not
noticing the rudeness of the question."
"“And in the past, have you ever seen ghosts before?”

“Y-yes, I have seen them, but only once in my life, six years ago."
"I had
a serf, Filka; just after his burial I called out forgetting ‘Filka, my
pipe!’ He came in and went to the cupboard where my pipes were."
"I sat
still and thought ‘he is doing it out of revenge,’ because we had a
violent quarrel just before his death."
"‘How dare you come in with a hole
in your elbow?’ I said."
"‘Go away, you scamp!’ He turned and went out,
and never came again."
I didn’t tell Marfa Petrovna at the time.
"I wanted
to have a service sung for him, but I was ashamed.”

“You should go to a doctor.”

“I know I am not well, without your telling me, though I don’t know
what’s wrong; I believe I am five times as strong as you are."
"I didn’t
ask you whether you believe that ghosts are seen, but whether you
believe that they exist.”

“No, I won’t believe it!” Raskolnikov cried, with positive anger."
"“What do people generally say?” muttered Svidrigaïlov, as though
speaking to himself, looking aside and bowing his head."
"“They say, ‘You
are ill, so what appears to you is only unreal fantasy.’ But that’s not
strictly logical."
"I agree that ghosts only appear to the sick, but that
only proves that they are unable to appear except to the sick, not that
they don’t exist.”

“Nothing of the sort,” Raskolnikov insisted irritably."
“No?
"You don’t think so?” Svidrigaïlov went on, looking at him
deliberately."
"“But what do you say to this argument (help me with
it): ghosts are, as it were, shreds and fragments of other worlds, the
beginning of them."
"A man in health has, of course, no reason to see
them, because he is above all a man of this earth and is bound for the
sake of completeness and order to live only in this life."
"But as soon
as one is ill, as soon as the normal earthly order of the organism is
broken, one begins to realise the possibility of another world; and the
more seriously ill one is, the closer becomes one’s contact with that
other world, so that as soon as the man dies he steps straight into that
world."
I thought of that long ago.
"If you believe in a future life, you
could believe in that, too.”

“I don’t believe in a future life,” said Raskolnikov."
Svidrigaïlov sat lost in thought.
"“And what if there are only spiders there, or something of that sort,”
 he said suddenly."
"“He is a madman,” thought Raskolnikov."
"“We always imagine eternity as something beyond our conception,
something vast, vast!"
But why must it be vast?
"Instead of all that, what
if it’s one little room, like a bath house in the country, black
and grimy and spiders in every corner, and that’s all eternity is?"
"I
sometimes fancy it like that.”

“Can it be you can imagine nothing juster and more comforting than
that?” Raskolnikov cried, with a feeling of anguish."
“Juster?
"And how can we tell, perhaps that is just, and do you know
it’s what I would certainly have made it,” answered Svidrigaïlov, with a
vague smile."
This horrible answer sent a cold chill through Raskolnikov.
"Svidrigaïlov
raised his head, looked at him, and suddenly began laughing."
"“Only think,” he cried, “half an hour ago we had never seen each other,
we regarded each other as enemies; there is a matter unsettled between
us; we’ve thrown it aside, and away we’ve gone into the abstract!"
"Wasn’t
I right in saying that we were birds of a feather?”

“Kindly allow me,” Raskolnikov went on irritably, “to ask you to explain
why you have honoured me with your visit... and... and I am in a hurry,
I have no time to waste."
"I want to go out.”

“By all means, by all means."
"Your sister, Avdotya Romanovna, is going to
be married to Mr. Luzhin, Pyotr Petrovitch?”

“Can you refrain from any question about my sister and from mentioning
her name?"
"I can’t understand how you dare utter her name in my presence,
if you really are Svidrigaïlov.”

“Why, but I’ve come here to speak about her; how can I avoid mentioning
her?”

“Very good, speak, but make haste.”

“I am sure that you must have formed your own opinion of this Mr.
Luzhin, who is a connection of mine through my wife, if you have only
seen him for half an hour, or heard any facts about him."
"He is no
match for Avdotya Romanovna."
"I believe Avdotya Romanovna is sacrificing
herself generously and imprudently for the sake of... for the sake of
her family."
"I fancied from all I had heard of you that you would be very
glad if the match could be broken off without the sacrifice of worldly
advantages."
"Now I know you personally, I am convinced of it.”

“All this is very naïve... excuse me, I should have said impudent on
your part,” said Raskolnikov."
“You mean to say that I am seeking my own ends.
"Don’t be uneasy, Rodion
Romanovitch, if I were working for my own advantage, I would not have
spoken out so directly."
I am not quite a fool.
"I will confess something
psychologically curious about that: just now, defending my love for
Avdotya Romanovna, I said I was myself the victim."
"Well, let me tell you
that I’ve no feeling of love now, not the slightest, so that I wonder
myself indeed, for I really did feel something...”

“Through idleness and depravity,” Raskolnikov put in."
"“I certainly am idle and depraved, but your sister has such qualities
that even I could not help being impressed by them."
"But that’s all
nonsense, as I see myself now.”

“Have you seen that long?”

“I began to be aware of it before, but was only perfectly sure of it the
day before yesterday, almost at the moment I arrived in Petersburg."
"I
still fancied in Moscow, though, that I was coming to try to get Avdotya
Romanovna’s hand and to cut out Mr. Luzhin.”

“Excuse me for interrupting you; kindly be brief, and come to the object
of your visit."
"I am in a hurry, I want to go out...”

“With the greatest pleasure."
"On arriving here and determining on a
certain... journey, I should like to make some necessary preliminary
arrangements."
"I left my children with an aunt; they are well provided
for; and they have no need of me personally."
"And a nice father I should
make, too!"
"I have taken nothing but what Marfa Petrovna gave me a year
ago."
That’s enough for me.
"Excuse me, I am just coming to the point."
"Before the journey which may come off, I want to settle Mr. Luzhin, too."
"It’s not that I detest him so much, but it was through him I quarrelled
with Marfa Petrovna when I learned that she had dished up this marriage."
"I want now to see Avdotya Romanovna through your mediation, and if you
like in your presence, to explain to her that in the first place she
will never gain anything but harm from Mr. Luzhin."
"Then, begging
her pardon for all past unpleasantness, to make her a present of ten
thousand roubles and so assist the rupture with Mr. Luzhin, a rupture to
which I believe she is herself not disinclined, if she could see the way
to it.”

“You are certainly mad,” cried Raskolnikov not so much angered as
astonished."
"“How dare you talk like that!”

“I knew you would scream at me; but in the first place, though I am not
rich, this ten thousand roubles is perfectly free; I have absolutely no
need for it."
"If Avdotya Romanovna does not accept it, I shall waste
it in some more foolish way."
That’s the first thing.
"Secondly, my
conscience is perfectly easy; I make the offer with no ulterior motive."
"You may not believe it, but in the end Avdotya Romanovna and you will
know."
"The point is, that I did actually cause your sister, whom I
greatly respect, some trouble and unpleasantness, and so, sincerely
regretting it, I want--not to compensate, not to repay her for the
unpleasantness, but simply to do something to her advantage, to show
that I am not, after all, privileged to do nothing but harm."
"If there
were a millionth fraction of self-interest in my offer, I should not
have made it so openly; and I should not have offered her ten thousand
only, when five weeks ago I offered her more, Besides, I may, perhaps,
very soon marry a young lady, and that alone ought to prevent suspicion
of any design on Avdotya Romanovna."
"In conclusion, let me say that
in marrying Mr. Luzhin, she is taking money just the same, only from
another man."
"Don’t be angry, Rodion Romanovitch, think it over coolly
and quietly.”

Svidrigaïlov himself was exceedingly cool and quiet as he was saying
this."
"“I beg you to say no more,” said Raskolnikov."
"“In any case this is
unpardonable impertinence.”

“Not in the least."
"Then a man may do nothing but harm to his neighbour
in this world, and is prevented from doing the tiniest bit of good
by trivial conventional formalities."
That’s absurd.
"If I died, for
instance, and left that sum to your sister in my will, surely she
wouldn’t refuse it?”

“Very likely she would.”

“Oh, no, indeed."
"However, if you refuse it, so be it, though ten
thousand roubles is a capital thing to have on occasion."
"In any case I
beg you to repeat what I have said to Avdotya Romanovna.”

“No, I won’t.”

“In that case, Rodion Romanovitch, I shall be obliged to try and see her
myself and worry her by doing so.”

“And if I do tell her, will you not try to see her?”

“I don’t know really what to say."
"I should like very much to see her
once more.”

“Don’t hope for it.”

“I’m sorry."
But you don’t know me.
"Perhaps we may become better
friends.”

“You think we may become friends?”

“And why not?” Svidrigaïlov said, smiling."
He stood up and took his hat.
"“I didn’t quite intend to disturb you and I came here without reckoning
on it... though I was very much struck by your face this morning.”

“Where did you see me this morning?” Raskolnikov asked uneasily."
“I saw you by chance....
"I kept fancying there is something about you
like me...."
But don’t be uneasy.
"I am not intrusive; I used to get on
all right with card-sharpers, and I never bored Prince Svirbey, a great
personage who is a distant relation of mine, and I could write about
Raphael’s _Madonna_ in Madam Prilukov’s album, and I never left Marfa
Petrovna’s side for seven years, and I used to stay the night at
Viazemsky’s house in the Hay Market in the old days, and I may go up in
a balloon with Berg, perhaps.”

“Oh, all right."
"Are you starting soon on your travels, may I ask?”

“What travels?”

“Why, on that ‘journey’; you spoke of it yourself.”

“A journey?"
"Oh, yes."
I did speak of a journey.
"Well, that’s a wide
subject.... if only you knew what you are asking,” he added, and gave
a sudden, loud, short laugh."
"“Perhaps I’ll get married instead of the
journey."
"They’re making a match for me.”

“Here?”

“Yes.”

“How have you had time for that?”

“But I am very anxious to see Avdotya Romanovna once."
"I earnestly beg
it."
"Well, good-bye for the present."
"Oh, yes."
I have forgotten something.
"Tell your sister, Rodion Romanovitch, that Marfa Petrovna remembered
her in her will and left her three thousand roubles."
"That’s absolutely
certain."
"Marfa Petrovna arranged it a week before her death, and it was
done in my presence."
"Avdotya Romanovna will be able to receive the money
in two or three weeks.”

“Are you telling the truth?”

“Yes, tell her."
"Well, your servant."
"I am staying very near you.”

As he went out, Svidrigaïlov ran up against Razumihin in the doorway."
"CHAPTER II

It was nearly eight o’clock."
"The two young men hurried to Bakaleyev’s,
to arrive before Luzhin."
"“Why, who was that?” asked Razumihin, as soon as they were in the
street."
"“It was Svidrigaïlov, that landowner in whose house my sister was
insulted when she was their governess."
"Through his persecuting her with
his attentions, she was turned out by his wife, Marfa Petrovna."
"This
Marfa Petrovna begged Dounia’s forgiveness afterwards, and she’s just
died suddenly."
It was of her we were talking this morning.
"I don’t
know why I’m afraid of that man."
"He came here at once after his wife’s
funeral."
"He is very strange, and is determined on doing something.... We
must guard Dounia from him... that’s what I wanted to tell you, do you
hear?”

“Guard her!"
What can he do to harm Avdotya Romanovna?
"Thank you, Rodya,
for speaking to me like that.... We will, we will guard her."
"Where does
he live?”

“I don’t know.”

“Why didn’t you ask?"
What a pity!
"I’ll find out, though.”

“Did you see him?” asked Raskolnikov after a pause."
"“Yes, I noticed him, I noticed him well.”

“You did really see him?"
You saw him clearly?” Raskolnikov insisted.
"“Yes, I remember him perfectly, I should know him in a thousand; I have
a good memory for faces.”

They were silent again."
“Hm!...
"that’s all right,” muttered Raskolnikov."
"“Do you know, I
fancied..."
"I keep thinking that it may have been an hallucination.”

“What do you mean?"
"I don’t understand you.”

“Well, you all say,” Raskolnikov went on, twisting his mouth into a
smile, “that I am mad."
"I thought just now that perhaps I really am mad,
and have only seen a phantom.”

“What do you mean?”

“Why, who can tell?"
"Perhaps I am really mad, and perhaps everything that
happened all these days may be only imagination.”

“Ach, Rodya, you have been upset again!..."
"But what did he say, what did
he come for?”

Raskolnikov did not answer."
Razumihin thought a minute.
"“Now let me tell you my story,” he began, “I came to you, you were
asleep."
"Then we had dinner and then I went to Porfiry’s, Zametov was
still with him."
"I tried to begin, but it was no use."
"I couldn’t speak in
the right way."
"They don’t seem to understand and can’t understand, but
are not a bit ashamed."
"I drew Porfiry to the window, and began talking
to him, but it was still no use."
He looked away and I looked away.
"At
last I shook my fist in his ugly face, and told him as a cousin I’d
brain him."
"He merely looked at me, I cursed and came away."
"That was
all."
It was very stupid.
To Zametov I didn’t say a word.
"But, you see, I
thought I’d made a mess of it, but as I went downstairs a brilliant idea
struck me: why should we trouble?"
"Of course if you were in any danger
or anything, but why need you care?"
You needn’t care a hang for them.
"We
shall have a laugh at them afterwards, and if I were in your place I’d
mystify them more than ever."
How ashamed they’ll be afterwards!
"Hang
them!"
"We can thrash them afterwards, but let’s laugh at them now!”

“To be sure,” answered Raskolnikov."
"“But what will you say to-morrow?”
 he thought to himself."
"Strange to say, till that moment it had never
occurred to him to wonder what Razumihin would think when he knew."
"As he
thought it, Raskolnikov looked at him."
"Razumihin’s account of his visit
to Porfiry had very little interest for him, so much had come and gone
since then."
"In the corridor they came upon Luzhin; he had arrived punctually
at eight, and was looking for the number, so that all three went in
together without greeting or looking at one another."
"The young men
walked in first, while Pyotr Petrovitch, for good manners, lingered a
little in the passage, taking off his coat."
"Pulcheria Alexandrovna came
forward at once to greet him in the doorway, Dounia was welcoming her
brother."
"Pyotr Petrovitch walked in and quite amiably, though with
redoubled dignity, bowed to the ladies."
"He looked, however, as though
he were a little put out and could not yet recover himself."
"Pulcheria
Alexandrovna, who seemed also a little embarrassed, hastened to make
them all sit down at the round table where a samovar was boiling."
"Dounia
and Luzhin were facing one another on opposite sides of the table."
"Razumihin and Raskolnikov were facing Pulcheria Alexandrovna, Razumihin
was next to Luzhin and Raskolnikov was beside his sister."
A moment’s silence followed.
"Pyotr Petrovitch deliberately drew out a
cambric handkerchief reeking of scent and blew his nose with an air of
a benevolent man who felt himself slighted, and was firmly resolved to
insist on an explanation."
"In the passage the idea had occurred to him to
keep on his overcoat and walk away, and so give the two ladies a sharp
and emphatic lesson and make them feel the gravity of the position."
But he could not bring himself to do this.
"Besides, he could not endure
uncertainty, and he wanted an explanation: if his request had been so
openly disobeyed, there was something behind it, and in that case it was
better to find it out beforehand; it rested with him to punish them and
there would always be time for that."
"“I trust you had a favourable journey,” he inquired officially of
Pulcheria Alexandrovna."
"“Oh, very, Pyotr Petrovitch.”

“I am gratified to hear it."
"And Avdotya Romanovna is not over-fatigued
either?”

“I am young and strong, I don’t get tired, but it was a great strain for
mother,” answered Dounia."
“That’s unavoidable!
our national railways are of terrible length.
"‘Mother Russia,’ as they say, is a vast country...."
"In spite of all my
desire to do so, I was unable to meet you yesterday."
"But I trust all
passed off without inconvenience?”

“Oh, no, Pyotr Petrovitch, it was all terribly disheartening,” Pulcheria
Alexandrovna hastened to declare with peculiar intonation, “and if
Dmitri Prokofitch had not been sent us, I really believe by God Himself,
we should have been utterly lost."
"Here, he is!"
"Dmitri Prokofitch
Razumihin,” she added, introducing him to Luzhin."
"“I had the pleasure... yesterday,” muttered Pyotr Petrovitch with a
hostile glance sidelong at Razumihin; then he scowled and was silent."
"Pyotr Petrovitch belonged to that class of persons, on the surface very
polite in society, who make a great point of punctiliousness, but who,
directly they are crossed in anything, are completely disconcerted, and
become more like sacks of flour than elegant and lively men of society."
"Again all was silent; Raskolnikov was obstinately mute, Avdotya
Romanovna was unwilling to open the conversation too soon."
"Razumihin had
nothing to say, so Pulcheria Alexandrovna was anxious again."
"“Marfa Petrovna is dead, have you heard?” she began having recourse to
her leading item of conversation."
"“To be sure, I heard so."
"I was immediately informed, and I have come to
make you acquainted with the fact that Arkady Ivanovitch Svidrigaïlov
set off in haste for Petersburg immediately after his wife’s funeral."
"So
at least I have excellent authority for believing.”

“To Petersburg?"
here?” Dounia asked in alarm and looked at her mother.
"“Yes, indeed, and doubtless not without some design, having in view the
rapidity of his departure, and all the circumstances preceding it.”

“Good heavens!"
"won’t he leave Dounia in peace even here?” cried
Pulcheria Alexandrovna."
"“I imagine that neither you nor Avdotya Romanovna have any grounds for
uneasiness, unless, of course, you are yourselves desirous of getting
into communication with him."
"For my part I am on my guard, and am now
discovering where he is lodging.”

“Oh, Pyotr Petrovitch, you would not believe what a fright you have
given me,” Pulcheria Alexandrovna went on: “I’ve only seen him twice,
but I thought him terrible, terrible!"
"I am convinced that he was the
cause of Marfa Petrovna’s death.”

“It’s impossible to be certain about that."
I have precise information.
"I
do not dispute that he may have contributed to accelerate the course of
events by the moral influence, so to say, of the affront; but as to the
general conduct and moral characteristics of that personage, I am
in agreement with you."
"I do not know whether he is well off now, and
precisely what Marfa Petrovna left him; this will be known to me within
a very short period; but no doubt here in Petersburg, if he has any
pecuniary resources, he will relapse at once into his old ways."
"He is
the most depraved, and abjectly vicious specimen of that class of men."
"I have considerable reason to believe that Marfa Petrovna, who was so
unfortunate as to fall in love with him and to pay his debts eight years
ago, was of service to him also in another way."
"Solely by her exertions
and sacrifices, a criminal charge, involving an element of fantastic
and homicidal brutality for which he might well have been sentenced to
Siberia, was hushed up."
"That’s the sort of man he is, if you care to
know.”

“Good heavens!” cried Pulcheria Alexandrovna."
"Raskolnikov listened
attentively."
"“Are you speaking the truth when you say that you have good evidence of
this?” Dounia asked sternly and emphatically."
“I only repeat what I was told in secret by Marfa Petrovna.
"I must
observe that from the legal point of view the case was far from clear."
"There was, and I believe still is, living here a woman called Resslich,
a foreigner, who lent small sums of money at interest, and did other
commissions, and with this woman Svidrigaïlov had for a long while close
and mysterious relations."
"She had a relation, a niece I believe, living
with her, a deaf and dumb girl of fifteen, or perhaps not more than
fourteen."
"Resslich hated this girl, and grudged her every crust; she
used to beat her mercilessly."
"One day the girl was found hanging in
the garret."
At the inquest the verdict was suicide.
"After the usual
proceedings the matter ended, but, later on, information was given that
the child had been... cruelly outraged by Svidrigaïlov."
"It is true, this
was not clearly established, the information was given by another German
woman of loose character whose word could not be trusted; no statement
was actually made to the police, thanks to Marfa Petrovna’s money and
exertions; it did not get beyond gossip."
"And yet the story is a very
significant one."
"You heard, no doubt, Avdotya Romanovna, when you were
with them the story of the servant Philip who died of ill treatment he
received six years ago, before the abolition of serfdom.”

“I heard, on the contrary, that this Philip hanged himself.”

“Quite so, but what drove him, or rather perhaps disposed him,
to suicide was the systematic persecution and severity of Mr.
Svidrigaïlov.”

“I don’t know that,” answered Dounia, dryly."
"“I only heard a queer story
that Philip was a sort of hypochondriac, a sort of domestic philosopher,
the servants used to say, ‘he read himself silly,’ and that he hanged
himself partly on account of Mr. Svidrigaïlov’s mockery of him and not
his blows."
"When I was there he behaved well to the servants, and they
were actually fond of him, though they certainly did blame him for
Philip’s death.”

“I perceive, Avdotya Romanovna, that you seem disposed to undertake his
defence all of a sudden,” Luzhin observed, twisting his lips into
an ambiguous smile, “there’s no doubt that he is an astute man, and
insinuating where ladies are concerned, of which Marfa Petrovna, who has
died so strangely, is a terrible instance."
"My only desire has been to be
of service to you and your mother with my advice, in view of the renewed
efforts which may certainly be anticipated from him."
"For my part it’s
my firm conviction, that he will end in a debtor’s prison again."
"Marfa Petrovna had not the slightest intention of settling anything
substantial on him, having regard for his children’s interests, and,
if she left him anything, it would only be the merest sufficiency,
something insignificant and ephemeral, which would not last a year for a
man of his habits.”

“Pyotr Petrovitch, I beg you,” said Dounia, “say no more of Mr.
Svidrigaïlov."
"It makes me miserable.”

“He has just been to see me,” said Raskolnikov, breaking his silence for
the first time."
"There were exclamations from all, and they all turned to him."
"Even Pyotr
Petrovitch was roused."
"“An hour and a half ago, he came in when I was asleep, waked me, and
introduced himself,” Raskolnikov continued."
"“He was fairly cheerful
and at ease, and quite hopes that we shall become friends."
"He is
particularly anxious, by the way, Dounia, for an interview with you, at
which he asked me to assist."
"He has a proposition to make to you, and
he told me about it."
"He told me, too, that a week before her death Marfa
Petrovna left you three thousand roubles in her will, Dounia, and that
you can receive the money very shortly.”

“Thank God!” cried Pulcheria Alexandrovna, crossing herself."
"“Pray for
her soul, Dounia!”

“It’s a fact!” broke from Luzhin."
"“Tell us, what more?” Dounia urged Raskolnikov."
"“Then he said that he wasn’t rich and all the estate was left to his
children who are now with an aunt, then that he was staying somewhere
not far from me, but where, I don’t know, I didn’t ask....”

“But what, what does he want to propose to Dounia?” cried Pulcheria
Alexandrovna in a fright."
"“Did he tell you?”

“Yes.”

“What was it?”

“I’ll tell you afterwards.”

Raskolnikov ceased speaking and turned his attention to his tea."
Pyotr Petrovitch looked at his watch.
"“I am compelled to keep a business engagement, and so I shall not be in
your way,” he added with an air of some pique and he began getting up."
"“Don’t go, Pyotr Petrovitch,” said Dounia, “you intended to spend
the evening."
"Besides, you wrote yourself that you wanted to have an
explanation with mother.”

“Precisely so, Avdotya Romanovna,” Pyotr Petrovitch answered
impressively, sitting down again, but still holding his hat."
"“I
certainly desired an explanation with you and your honoured mother upon
a very important point indeed."
"But as your brother cannot speak openly
in my presence of some proposals of Mr. Svidrigaïlov, I, too, do not
desire and am not able to speak openly... in the presence of others...
of certain matters of the greatest gravity."
"Moreover, my most weighty
and urgent request has been disregarded....”

Assuming an aggrieved air, Luzhin relapsed into dignified silence."
"“Your request that my brother should not be present at our meeting was
disregarded solely at my insistance,” said Dounia."
"“You wrote that you
had been insulted by my brother; I think that this must be explained at
once, and you must be reconciled."
"And if Rodya really has insulted you,
then he _should_ and _will_ apologise.”

Pyotr Petrovitch took a stronger line."
"“There are insults, Avdotya Romanovna, which no goodwill can make us
forget."
"There is a line in everything which it is dangerous to overstep;
and when it has been overstepped, there is no return.”

“That wasn’t what I was speaking of exactly, Pyotr Petrovitch,” Dounia
interrupted with some impatience."
"“Please understand that our whole
future depends now on whether all this is explained and set right as
soon as possible."
"I tell you frankly at the start that I cannot look at
it in any other light, and if you have the least regard for me, all this
business must be ended to-day, however hard that may be."
"I repeat that
if my brother is to blame he will ask your forgiveness.”

“I am surprised at your putting the question like that,” said Luzhin,
getting more and more irritated."
"“Esteeming, and so to say, adoring you,
I may at the same time, very well indeed, be able to dislike some member
of your family."
"Though I lay claim to the happiness of your hand, I
cannot accept duties incompatible with...”

“Ah, don’t be so ready to take offence, Pyotr Petrovitch,” Dounia
interrupted with feeling, “and be the sensible and generous man I have
always considered, and wish to consider, you to be."
"I’ve given you a
great promise, I am your betrothed."
"Trust me in this matter and, believe
me, I shall be capable of judging impartially."
"My assuming the part of
judge is as much a surprise for my brother as for you."
"When I insisted
on his coming to our interview to-day after your letter, I told
him nothing of what I meant to do."
"Understand that, if you are not
reconciled, I must choose between you--it must be either you or he."
"That
is how the question rests on your side and on his."
"I don’t want to be
mistaken in my choice, and I must not be."
"For your sake I must break off
with my brother, for my brother’s sake I must break off with you."
"I can
find out for certain now whether he is a brother to me, and I want to
know it; and of you, whether I am dear to you, whether you esteem me,
whether you are the husband for me.”

“Avdotya Romanovna,” Luzhin declared huffily, “your words are of too
much consequence to me; I will say more, they are offensive in view
of the position I have the honour to occupy in relation to you."
"To say
nothing of your strange and offensive setting me on a level with an
impertinent boy, you admit the possibility of breaking your promise to
me."
"You say ‘you or he,’ showing thereby of how little consequence I
am in your eyes..."
"I cannot let this pass considering the relationship
and... the obligations existing between us.”

“What!” cried Dounia, flushing."
"“I set your interest beside all that has
hitherto been most precious in my life, what has made up the _whole_ of
my life, and here you are offended at my making too _little_ account of
you.”

Raskolnikov smiled sarcastically, Razumihin fidgeted, but Pyotr
Petrovitch did not accept the reproof; on the contrary, at every word he
became more persistent and irritable, as though he relished it."
"“Love for the future partner of your life, for your husband, ought to
outweigh your love for your brother,” he pronounced sententiously, “and
in any case I cannot be put on the same level...."
"Although I said so
emphatically that I would not speak openly in your brother’s presence,
nevertheless, I intend now to ask your honoured mother for a necessary
explanation on a point of great importance closely affecting my dignity."
"Your son,” he turned to Pulcheria Alexandrovna, “yesterday in the
presence of Mr. Razsudkin (or..."
I think that’s it?
"excuse me I have
forgotten your surname,” he bowed politely to Razumihin) “insulted me by
misrepresenting the idea I expressed to you in a private conversation,
drinking coffee, that is, that marriage with a poor girl who has had
experience of trouble is more advantageous from the conjugal point of
view than with one who has lived in luxury, since it is more profitable
for the moral character."
"Your son intentionally exaggerated the
significance of my words and made them ridiculous, accusing me of
malicious intentions, and, as far as I could see, relied upon your
correspondence with him."
"I shall consider myself happy, Pulcheria
Alexandrovna, if it is possible for you to convince me of an opposite
conclusion, and thereby considerately reassure me."
"Kindly let me know
in what terms precisely you repeated my words in your letter to Rodion
Romanovitch.”

“I don’t remember,” faltered Pulcheria Alexandrovna."
"“I repeated them as
I understood them."
"I don’t know how Rodya repeated them to you, perhaps
he exaggerated.”

“He could not have exaggerated them, except at your instigation.”

“Pyotr Petrovitch,” Pulcheria Alexandrovna declared with dignity, “the
proof that Dounia and I did not take your words in a very bad sense is
the fact that we are here.”

“Good, mother,” said Dounia approvingly."
"“Then this is my fault again,” said Luzhin, aggrieved."
"“Well, Pyotr Petrovitch, you keep blaming Rodion, but you yourself have
just written what was false about him,” Pulcheria Alexandrovna added,
gaining courage."
"“I don’t remember writing anything false.”

“You wrote,” Raskolnikov said sharply, not turning to Luzhin, “that I
gave money yesterday not to the widow of the man who was killed, as was
the fact, but to his daughter (whom I had never seen till yesterday)."
"You wrote this to make dissension between me and my family, and for that
object added coarse expressions about the conduct of a girl whom you
don’t know."
"All that is mean slander.”

“Excuse me, sir,” said Luzhin, quivering with fury."
"“I enlarged upon
your qualities and conduct in my letter solely in response to your
sister’s and mother’s inquiries, how I found you, and what impression
you made on me."
"As for what you’ve alluded to in my letter, be so good
as to point out one word of falsehood, show, that is, that you didn’t
throw away your money, and that there are not worthless persons in that
family, however unfortunate.”

“To my thinking, you, with all your virtues, are not worth the little
finger of that unfortunate girl at whom you throw stones.”

“Would you go so far then as to let her associate with your mother and
sister?”

“I have done so already, if you care to know."
"I made her sit down to-day
with mother and Dounia.”

“Rodya!” cried Pulcheria Alexandrovna."
"Dounia crimsoned, Razumihin
knitted his brows."
Luzhin smiled with lofty sarcasm.
"“You may see for yourself, Avdotya Romanovna,” he said, “whether it is
possible for us to agree."
"I hope now that this question is at an end,
once and for all."
"I will withdraw, that I may not hinder the pleasures
of family intimacy, and the discussion of secrets.” He got up from his
chair and took his hat."
"“But in withdrawing, I venture to request
that for the future I may be spared similar meetings, and, so to
say, compromises."
"I appeal particularly to you, honoured Pulcheria
Alexandrovna, on this subject, the more as my letter was addressed to
you and to no one else.”

Pulcheria Alexandrovna was a little offended."
"“You seem to think we are completely under your authority, Pyotr
Petrovitch."
"Dounia has told you the reason your desire was disregarded,
she had the best intentions."
"And indeed you write as though you were
laying commands upon me."
"Are we to consider every desire of yours as
a command?"
"Let me tell you on the contrary that you ought to show
particular delicacy and consideration for us now, because we have thrown
up everything, and have come here relying on you, and so we are in any
case in a sense in your hands.”

“That is not quite true, Pulcheria Alexandrovna, especially at the
present moment, when the news has come of Marfa Petrovna’s legacy, which
seems indeed very apropos, judging from the new tone you take to me,” he
added sarcastically."
"“Judging from that remark, we may certainly presume that you were
reckoning on our helplessness,” Dounia observed irritably."
"“But now in any case I cannot reckon on it, and I particularly desire
not to hinder your discussion of the secret proposals of Arkady
Ivanovitch Svidrigaïlov, which he has entrusted to your brother and
which have, I perceive, a great and possibly a very agreeable interest
for you.”

“Good heavens!” cried Pulcheria Alexandrovna."
Razumihin could not sit still on his chair.
"“Aren’t you ashamed now, sister?” asked Raskolnikov."
"“I am ashamed, Rodya,” said Dounia."
"“Pyotr Petrovitch, go away,” she
turned to him, white with anger."
Pyotr Petrovitch had apparently not at all expected such a conclusion.
"He had too much confidence in himself, in his power and in the
helplessness of his victims."
He could not believe it even now.
"He turned
pale, and his lips quivered."
"“Avdotya Romanovna, if I go out of this door now, after such a
dismissal, then, you may reckon on it, I will never come back."
"Consider
what you are doing."
"My word is not to be shaken.”

“What insolence!” cried Dounia, springing up from her seat."
"“I don’t
want you to come back again.”

“What!"
"So that’s how it stands!” cried Luzhin, utterly unable to the
last moment to believe in the rupture and so completely thrown out of
his reckoning now."
“So that’s how it stands!
"But do you know, Avdotya
Romanovna, that I might protest?”

“What right have you to speak to her like that?” Pulcheria Alexandrovna
intervened hotly."
“And what can you protest about?
What rights have you?
Am I to give my Dounia to a man like you?
"Go away, leave us altogether!"
"We are to blame for having agreed to a wrong action, and I above
all....”

“But you have bound me, Pulcheria Alexandrovna,” Luzhin stormed in a
frenzy, “by your promise, and now you deny it and... besides..."
"I have
been led on account of that into expenses....”

This last complaint was so characteristic of Pyotr Petrovitch, that
Raskolnikov, pale with anger and with the effort of restraining it,
could not help breaking into laughter."
"But Pulcheria Alexandrovna was
furious."
“Expenses?
What expenses?
Are you speaking of our trunk?
"But the
conductor brought it for nothing for you."
"Mercy on us, we have bound
you!"
"What are you thinking about, Pyotr Petrovitch, it was you bound us,
hand and foot, not we!”

“Enough, mother, no more please,” Avdotya Romanovna implored."
"“Pyotr
Petrovitch, do be kind and go!”

“I am going, but one last word,” he said, quite unable to control
himself."
"“Your mamma seems to have entirely forgotten that I made up my
mind to take you, so to speak, after the gossip of the town had spread
all over the district in regard to your reputation."
"Disregarding public
opinion for your sake and reinstating your reputation, I certainly
might very well reckon on a fitting return, and might indeed look for
gratitude on your part."
And my eyes have only now been opened!
"I see
myself that I may have acted very, very recklessly in disregarding the
universal verdict....”

“Does the fellow want his head smashed?” cried Razumihin, jumping up."
“You are a mean and spiteful man!” cried Dounia.
“Not a word!
"Not a movement!” cried Raskolnikov, holding Razumihin back;
then going close up to Luzhin, “Kindly leave the room!” he said quietly
and distinctly, “and not a word more or...”

Pyotr Petrovitch gazed at him for some seconds with a pale face that
worked with anger, then he turned, went out, and rarely has any man
carried away in his heart such vindictive hatred as he felt against
Raskolnikov."
"Him, and him alone, he blamed for everything."
"It is
noteworthy that as he went downstairs he still imagined that his case
was perhaps not utterly lost, and that, so far as the ladies were
concerned, all might “very well indeed” be set right again."
"CHAPTER III

The fact was that up to the last moment he had never expected such an
ending; he had been overbearing to the last degree, never dreaming that
two destitute and defenceless women could escape from his control."
"This
conviction was strengthened by his vanity and conceit, a conceit to
the point of fatuity."
"Pyotr Petrovitch, who had made his way up from
insignificance, was morbidly given to self-admiration, had the highest
opinion of his intelligence and capacities, and sometimes even gloated
in solitude over his image in the glass."
"But what he loved and valued
above all was the money he had amassed by his labour, and by all sorts
of devices: that money made him the equal of all who had been his
superiors."
"When he had bitterly reminded Dounia that he had decided to take her in
spite of evil report, Pyotr Petrovitch had spoken with perfect sincerity
and had, indeed, felt genuinely indignant at such “black ingratitude.”
 And yet, when he made Dounia his offer, he was fully aware of the
groundlessness of all the gossip."
"The story had been everywhere
contradicted by Marfa Petrovna, and was by then disbelieved by all the
townspeople, who were warm in Dounia’a defence."
"And he would not have
denied that he knew all that at the time."
"Yet he still thought highly
of his own resolution in lifting Dounia to his level and regarded it as
something heroic."
"In speaking of it to Dounia, he had let out the secret
feeling he cherished and admired, and he could not understand that
others should fail to admire it too."
"He had called on Raskolnikov with
the feelings of a benefactor who is about to reap the fruits of his good
deeds and to hear agreeable flattery."
"And as he went downstairs now, he
considered himself most undeservedly injured and unrecognised."
Dounia was simply essential to him; to do without her was unthinkable.
"For many years he had had voluptuous dreams of marriage, but he had
gone on waiting and amassing money."
"He brooded with relish, in profound
secret, over the image of a girl--virtuous, poor (she must be poor),
very young, very pretty, of good birth and education, very timid, one
who had suffered much, and was completely humbled before him, one who
would all her life look on him as her saviour, worship him, admire him
and only him."
"How many scenes, how many amorous episodes he had imagined
on this seductive and playful theme, when his work was over!"
"And,
behold, the dream of so many years was all but realised; the beauty and
education of Avdotya Romanovna had impressed him; her helpless position
had been a great allurement; in her he had found even more than he
dreamed of."
"Here was a girl of pride, character, virtue, of education
and breeding superior to his own (he felt that), and this creature would
be slavishly grateful all her life for his heroic condescension, and
would humble herself in the dust before him, and he would have absolute,
unbounded power over her!..."
"Not long before, he had, too, after long
reflection and hesitation, made an important change in his career and
was now entering on a wider circle of business."
"With this change his
cherished dreams of rising into a higher class of society seemed likely
to be realised...."
"He was, in fact, determined to try his fortune
in Petersburg."
He knew that women could do a very great deal.
"The
fascination of a charming, virtuous, highly educated woman might make
his way easier, might do wonders in attracting people to him, throwing
an aureole round him, and now everything was in ruins!"
"This sudden
horrible rupture affected him like a clap of thunder; it was like a
hideous joke, an absurdity."
"He had only been a tiny bit masterful,
had not even time to speak out, had simply made a joke, been carried
away--and it had ended so seriously."
"And, of course, too, he did love
Dounia in his own way; he already possessed her in his dreams--and all
at once!"
No!
"The next day, the very next day, it must all be set right,
smoothed over, settled."
"Above all he must crush that conceited milksop
who was the cause of it all."
"With a sick feeling he could not help
recalling Razumihin too, but, he soon reassured himself on that score;
as though a fellow like that could be put on a level with him!"
"The man
he really dreaded in earnest was Svidrigaïlov...."
"He had, in short, a
great deal to attend to....

*****

“No, I, I am more to blame than anyone!” said Dounia, kissing and
embracing her mother."
"“I was tempted by his money, but on my honour,
brother, I had no idea he was such a base man."
"If I had seen through him
before, nothing would have tempted me!"
"Don’t blame me, brother!”

“God has delivered us!"
"God has delivered us!” Pulcheria Alexandrovna
muttered, but half consciously, as though scarcely able to realise what
had happened."
"They were all relieved, and in five minutes they were laughing."
"Only now
and then Dounia turned white and frowned, remembering what had passed."
"Pulcheria Alexandrovna was surprised to find that she, too, was glad:
she had only that morning thought rupture with Luzhin a terrible
misfortune."
Razumihin was delighted.
"He did not yet dare to express his
joy fully, but he was in a fever of excitement as though a ton-weight
had fallen off his heart."
"Now he had the right to devote his life to
them, to serve them...."
Anything might happen now!
"But he felt afraid to
think of further possibilities and dared not let his imagination
range."
"But Raskolnikov sat still in the same place, almost sullen and
indifferent."
"Though he had been the most insistent on getting rid of
Luzhin, he seemed now the least concerned at what had happened."
"Dounia
could not help thinking that he was still angry with her, and Pulcheria
Alexandrovna watched him timidly."
"“What did Svidrigaïlov say to you?” said Dounia, approaching him."
"“Yes, yes!” cried Pulcheria Alexandrovna."
Raskolnikov raised his head.
"“He wants to make you a present of ten thousand roubles and he desires
to see you once in my presence.”

“See her!"
On no account!” cried Pulcheria Alexandrovna.
"“And how dare he
offer her money!”

Then Raskolnikov repeated (rather dryly) his conversation with
Svidrigaïlov, omitting his account of the ghostly visitations of Marfa
Petrovna, wishing to avoid all unnecessary talk."
“What answer did you give him?” asked Dounia.
“At first I said I would not take any message to you.
"Then he said that
he would do his utmost to obtain an interview with you without my help."
"He assured me that his passion for you was a passing infatuation, now he
has no feeling for you."
"He doesn’t want you to marry Luzhin.... His talk
was altogether rather muddled.”

“How do you explain him to yourself, Rodya?"
"How did he strike you?”

“I must confess I don’t quite understand him."
"He offers you ten
thousand, and yet says he is not well off."
"He says he is going away, and
in ten minutes he forgets he has said it."
"Then he says he is going to be
married and has already fixed on the girl.... No doubt he has a motive,
and probably a bad one."
"But it’s odd that he should be so clumsy about
it if he had any designs against you.... Of course, I refused this
money on your account, once for all."
"Altogether, I thought him very
strange.... One might almost think he was mad."
"But I may be mistaken;
that may only be the part he assumes."
"The death of Marfa Petrovna seems
to have made a great impression on him.”

“God rest her soul,” exclaimed Pulcheria Alexandrovna."
"“I shall always,
always pray for her!"
"Where should we be now, Dounia, without this three
thousand!"
It’s as though it had fallen from heaven!
"Why, Rodya, this
morning we had only three roubles in our pocket and Dounia and I were
just planning to pawn her watch, so as to avoid borrowing from that man
until he offered help.”

Dounia seemed strangely impressed by Svidrigaïlov’s offer."
"She still
stood meditating."
"“He has got some terrible plan,” she said in a half whisper to herself,
almost shuddering."
Raskolnikov noticed this disproportionate terror.
"“I fancy I shall have to see him more than once again,” he said to
Dounia."
“We will watch him!
"I will track him out!” cried Razumihin, vigorously."
“I won’t lose sight of him.
Rodya has given me leave.
"He said to me
himself just now."
"‘Take care of my sister.’ Will you give me leave, too,
Avdotya Romanovna?”

Dounia smiled and held out her hand, but the look of anxiety did not
leave her face."
"Pulcheria Alexandrovna gazed at her timidly, but the
three thousand roubles had obviously a soothing effect on her."
"A quarter of an hour later, they were all engaged in a lively
conversation."
"Even Raskolnikov listened attentively for some time,
though he did not talk."
Razumihin was the speaker.
"“And why, why should you go away?” he flowed on ecstatically."
"“And what
are you to do in a little town?"
"The great thing is, you are all here
together and you need one another--you do need one another, believe me."
"For a time, anyway.... Take me into partnership, and I assure you we’ll
plan a capital enterprise."
Listen!
"I’ll explain it all in detail to
you, the whole project!"
"It all flashed into my head this morning,
before anything had happened..."
"I tell you what; I have an uncle, I must
introduce him to you (a most accommodating and respectable old man)."
"This uncle has got a capital of a thousand roubles, and he lives on his
pension and has no need of that money."
"For the last two years he has
been bothering me to borrow it from him and pay him six per cent."
interest.
I know what that means; he simply wants to help me.
"Last year
I had no need of it, but this year I resolved to borrow it as soon as
he arrived."
"Then you lend me another thousand of your three and we have
enough for a start, so we’ll go into partnership, and what are we going
to do?”

Then Razumihin began to unfold his project, and he explained at length
that almost all our publishers and booksellers know nothing at all
of what they are selling, and for that reason they are usually bad
publishers, and that any decent publications pay as a rule and give
a profit, sometimes a considerable one."
"Razumihin had, indeed, been
dreaming of setting up as a publisher."
"For the last two years he had
been working in publishers’ offices, and knew three European languages
well, though he had told Raskolnikov six days before that he was
“schwach” in German with an object of persuading him to take half his
translation and half the payment for it."
"He had told a lie then, and
Raskolnikov knew he was lying."
"“Why, why should we let our chance slip when we have one of the chief
means of success--money of our own!” cried Razumihin warmly."
"“Of course
there will be a lot of work, but we will work, you, Avdotya Romanovna,
I, Rodion.... You get a splendid profit on some books nowadays!"
"And
the great point of the business is that we shall know just what wants
translating, and we shall be translating, publishing, learning all at
once."
I can be of use because I have experience.
"For nearly two years
I’ve been scuttling about among the publishers, and now I know every
detail of their business."
"You need not be a saint to make pots, believe
me!"
"And why, why should we let our chance slip!"
"Why, I know--and I kept
the secret--two or three books which one might get a hundred roubles
simply for thinking of translating and publishing."
"Indeed, and I would
not take five hundred for the very idea of one of them."
"And what do you
think?"
"If I were to tell a publisher, I dare say he’d hesitate--they are
such blockheads!"
"And as for the business side, printing, paper, selling,
you trust to me, I know my way about."
"We’ll begin in a small way and go
on to a large."
"In any case it will get us our living and we shall get
back our capital.”

Dounia’s eyes shone."
"“I like what you are saying, Dmitri Prokofitch!” she said."
"“I know nothing about it, of course,” put in Pulcheria Alexandrovna,
“it may be a good idea, but again God knows."
It’s new and untried.
"Of
course, we must remain here at least for a time.” She looked at Rodya."
"“What do you think, brother?” said Dounia."
"“I think he’s got a very good idea,” he answered."
"“Of course, it’s too
soon to dream of a publishing firm, but we certainly might bring out
five or six books and be sure of success."
"I know of one book myself
which would be sure to go well."
"And as for his being able to manage it,
there’s no doubt about that either."
He knows the business....
"But we can
talk it over later....”

“Hurrah!” cried Razumihin."
"“Now, stay, there’s a flat here in this
house, belonging to the same owner."
"It’s a special flat apart, not
communicating with these lodgings."
"It’s furnished, rent moderate,
three rooms."
Suppose you take them to begin with.
"I’ll pawn your watch
to-morrow and bring you the money, and everything can be arranged then."
"You can all three live together, and Rodya will be with you."
"But where
are you off to, Rodya?”

“What, Rodya, you are going already?” Pulcheria Alexandrovna asked in
dismay."
“At such a minute?” cried Razumihin.
Dounia looked at her brother with incredulous wonder.
"He held his cap in
his hand, he was preparing to leave them."
"“One would think you were burying me or saying good-bye for ever,” he
said somewhat oddly."
"He attempted to smile, but it did not turn out a
smile."
"“But who knows, perhaps it is the last time we shall see each
other...” he let slip accidentally."
"It was what he was thinking, and it
somehow was uttered aloud."
“What is the matter with you?” cried his mother.
"“Where are you going, Rodya?” asked Dounia rather strangely."
"“Oh, I’m quite obliged to...” he answered vaguely, as though hesitating
what he would say."
"But there was a look of sharp determination in his
white face."
“I meant to say... as I was coming here...
"I meant to tell you, mother,
and you, Dounia, that it would be better for us to part for a time."
"I
feel ill, I am not at peace...."
"I will come afterwards, I will come of
myself... when it’s possible."
"I remember you and love you.... Leave me,
leave me alone."
"I decided this even before... I’m absolutely resolved on
it."
"Whatever may come to me, whether I come to ruin or not, I want to be
alone."
"Forget me altogether, it’s better."
Don’t inquire about me.
"When
I can, I’ll come of myself or... I’ll send for you."
"Perhaps it will all
come back, but now if you love me, give me up... else I shall begin to
hate you, I feel it.... Good-bye!”

“Good God!” cried Pulcheria Alexandrovna."
"Both his mother and his sister
were terribly alarmed."
Razumihin was also.
"“Rodya, Rodya, be reconciled with us!"
"Let us be as before!” cried his
poor mother."
He turned slowly to the door and slowly went out of the room.
"Dounia
overtook him."
"“Brother, what are you doing to mother?” she whispered, her eyes
flashing with indignation."
He looked dully at her.
"“No matter, I shall come.... I’m coming,” he muttered in an undertone,
as though not fully conscious of what he was saying, and he went out of
the room."
"“Wicked, heartless egoist!” cried Dounia."
"“He is insane, but not heartless."
He is mad!
Don’t you see it?
"You’re
heartless after that!” Razumihin whispered in her ear, squeezing
her hand tightly."
"“I shall be back directly,” he shouted to the
horror-stricken mother, and he ran out of the room."
Raskolnikov was waiting for him at the end of the passage.
"“I knew you would run after me,” he said."
"“Go back to them--be with
them... be with them to-morrow and always...."
"I... perhaps I shall
come... if I can."
"Good-bye.”

And without holding out his hand he walked away."
“But where are you going?
What are you doing?
"What’s the matter with
you?"
"How can you go on like this?” Razumihin muttered, at his wits’ end."
Raskolnikov stopped once more.
"“Once for all, never ask me about anything."
I have nothing to tell you.
Don’t come to see me.
"Maybe I’ll come here.... Leave me, but _don’t
leave_ them."
"Do you understand me?”

It was dark in the corridor, they were standing near the lamp."
"For a
minute they were looking at one another in silence."
"Razumihin remembered
that minute all his life."
"Raskolnikov’s burning and intent eyes
grew more penetrating every moment, piercing into his soul, into his
consciousness."
Suddenly Razumihin started.
"Something strange, as it
were, passed between them...."
"Some idea, some hint, as it were, slipped,
something awful, hideous, and suddenly understood on both sides....
Razumihin turned pale."
"“Do you understand now?” said Raskolnikov, his face twitching nervously."
"“Go back, go to them,” he said suddenly, and turning quickly, he went
out of the house."
"I will not attempt to describe how Razumihin went back to the ladies,
how he soothed them, how he protested that Rodya needed rest in his
illness, protested that Rodya was sure to come, that he would come every
day, that he was very, very much upset, that he must not be irritated,
that he, Razumihin, would watch over him, would get him a doctor, the
best doctor, a consultation...."
"In fact from that evening Razumihin took
his place with them as a son and a brother."
"CHAPTER IV

Raskolnikov went straight to the house on the canal bank where Sonia
lived."
It was an old green house of three storeys.
"He found the
porter and obtained from him vague directions as to the whereabouts of
Kapernaumov, the tailor."
"Having found in the corner of the courtyard
the entrance to the dark and narrow staircase, he mounted to the second
floor and came out into a gallery that ran round the whole second storey
over the yard."
"While he was wandering in the darkness, uncertain where
to turn for Kapernaumov’s door, a door opened three paces from him; he
mechanically took hold of it."
“Who is there?” a woman’s voice asked uneasily.
"“It’s I... come to see you,” answered Raskolnikov and he walked into the
tiny entry."
On a broken chair stood a candle in a battered copper candlestick.
“It’s you!
"Good heavens!” cried Sonia weakly, and she stood rooted to
the spot."
“Which is your room?
"This way?” and Raskolnikov, trying not to look at
her, hastened in."
"A minute later Sonia, too, came in with the candle, set down the
candlestick and, completely disconcerted, stood before him inexpressibly
agitated and apparently frightened by his unexpected visit."
"The colour
rushed suddenly to her pale face and tears came into her eyes... She
felt sick and ashamed and happy, too.... Raskolnikov turned away quickly
and sat on a chair by the table."
He scanned the room in a rapid glance.
"It was a large but exceedingly low-pitched room, the only one let by the
Kapernaumovs, to whose rooms a closed door led in the wall on the left."
"In the opposite side on the right hand wall was another door, always
kept locked."
"That led to the next flat, which formed a separate lodging."
"Sonia’s room looked like a barn; it was a very irregular quadrangle and
this gave it a grotesque appearance."
"A wall with three windows looking
out on to the canal ran aslant so that one corner formed a very acute
angle, and it was difficult to see in it without very strong light."
The other corner was disproportionately obtuse.
"There was scarcely any
furniture in the big room: in the corner on the right was a bedstead,
beside it, nearest the door, a chair."
"A plain, deal table covered by a
blue cloth stood against the same wall, close to the door into the other
flat."
Two rush-bottom chairs stood by the table.
"On the opposite
wall near the acute angle stood a small plain wooden chest of drawers
looking, as it were, lost in a desert."
"That was all there was in the
room."
"The yellow, scratched and shabby wall-paper was black in the
corners."
It must have been damp and full of fumes in the winter.
"There
was every sign of poverty; even the bedstead had no curtain."
"Sonia looked in silence at her visitor, who was so attentively and
unceremoniously scrutinising her room, and even began at last to tremble
with terror, as though she was standing before her judge and the arbiter
of her destinies."
"“I am late.... It’s eleven, isn’t it?” he asked, still not lifting his
eyes."
"“Yes,” muttered Sonia, “oh yes, it is,” she added, hastily, as though in
that lay her means of escape."
“My landlady’s clock has just struck...
"I
heard it myself....”

“I’ve come to you for the last time,” Raskolnikov went on gloomily,
although this was the first time."
"“I may perhaps not see you again...”

“Are you... going away?”

“I don’t know... to-morrow....”

“Then you are not coming to Katerina Ivanovna to-morrow?” Sonia’s voice
shook."
“I don’t know.
"I shall know to-morrow morning.... Never mind that: I’ve
come to say one word....”

He raised his brooding eyes to her and suddenly noticed that he was
sitting down while she was all the while standing before him."
“Why are you standing?
"Sit down,” he said in a changed voice, gentle and
friendly."
She sat down.
He looked kindly and almost compassionately at her.
“How thin you are!
What a hand!
"Quite transparent, like a dead hand.”

He took her hand."
Sonia smiled faintly.
"“I have always been like that,” she said."
"“Even when you lived at home?”

“Yes.”

“Of course, you were,” he added abruptly and the expression of his face
and the sound of his voice changed again suddenly."
He looked round him once more.
"“You rent this room from the Kapernaumovs?”

“Yes....”

“They live there, through that door?”

“Yes...."
"They have another room like this.”

“All in one room?”

“Yes.”

“I should be afraid in your room at night,” he observed gloomily."
"“They are very good people, very kind,” answered Sonia, who still seemed
bewildered, “and all the furniture, everything... everything is theirs."
"And they are very kind and the children, too, often come to see me.”

“They all stammer, don’t they?”

“Yes...."
He stammers and he’s lame.
"And his wife, too.... It’s not
exactly that she stammers, but she can’t speak plainly."
"She is a very
kind woman."
And he used to be a house serf.
"And there are seven
children... and it’s only the eldest one that stammers and the others
are simply ill... but they don’t stammer...."
"But where did you hear
about them?” she added with some surprise."
"“Your father told me, then."
"He told me all about you.... And how you
went out at six o’clock and came back at nine and how Katerina Ivanovna
knelt down by your bed.”

Sonia was confused."
"“I fancied I saw him to-day,” she whispered hesitatingly."
"“Whom?”

“Father."
"I was walking in the street, out there at the corner, about ten
o’clock and he seemed to be walking in front."
It looked just like him.
"I
wanted to go to Katerina Ivanovna....”

“You were walking in the streets?”

“Yes,” Sonia whispered abruptly, again overcome with confusion and
looking down."
"“Katerina Ivanovna used to beat you, I dare say?”

“Oh no, what are you saying?"
"No!” Sonia looked at him almost with
dismay."
"“You love her, then?”

“Love her?"
"Of course!” said Sonia with plaintive emphasis, and she
clasped her hands in distress."
"“Ah, you don’t...."
If you only knew!
"You see, she is quite like a child...."
"Her mind is quite unhinged, you
see... from sorrow."
"And how clever she used to be... how generous... how
kind!"
"Ah, you don’t understand, you don’t understand!”

Sonia said this as though in despair, wringing her hands in excitement
and distress."
"Her pale cheeks flushed, there was a look of anguish in
her eyes."
"It was clear that she was stirred to the very depths, that
she was longing to speak, to champion, to express something."
"A sort
of _insatiable_ compassion, if one may so express it, was reflected in
every feature of her face."
“Beat me!
how can you?
"Good heavens, beat me!"
"And if she did beat me,
what then?"
What of it?
"You know nothing, nothing about it.... She is so
unhappy... ah, how unhappy!"
"And ill.... She is seeking righteousness,
she is pure."
"She has such faith that there must be righteousness
everywhere and she expects it.... And if you were to torture her, she
wouldn’t do wrong."
"She doesn’t see that it’s impossible for people to
be righteous and she is angry at it."
"Like a child, like a child."
"She is
good!”

“And what will happen to you?”

Sonia looked at him inquiringly."
"“They are left on your hands, you see."
"They were all on your hands
before, though.... And your father came to you to beg for drink."
"Well,
how will it be now?”

“I don’t know,” Sonia articulated mournfully."
"“Will they stay there?”

“I don’t know...."
"They are in debt for the lodging, but the landlady,
I hear, said to-day that she wanted to get rid of them, and Katerina
Ivanovna says that she won’t stay another minute.”

“How is it she is so bold?"
"She relies upon you?”

“Oh, no, don’t talk like that.... We are one, we live like one.” Sonia
was agitated again and even angry, as though a canary or some other
little bird were to be angry."
“And what could she do?
"What, what could
she do?” she persisted, getting hot and excited."
"“And how she cried
to-day!"
"Her mind is unhinged, haven’t you noticed it?"
"At one minute she
is worrying like a child that everything should be right to-morrow, the
lunch and all that.... Then she is wringing her hands, spitting blood,
weeping, and all at once she will begin knocking her head against the
wall, in despair."
Then she will be comforted again.
"She builds all her
hopes on you; she says that you will help her now and that she will
borrow a little money somewhere and go to her native town with me and
set up a boarding school for the daughters of gentlemen and take me to
superintend it, and we will begin a new splendid life."
"And she kisses
and hugs me, comforts me, and you know she has such faith, such faith in
her fancies!"
One can’t contradict her.
"And all the day long she has been
washing, cleaning, mending."
"She dragged the wash tub into the room with
her feeble hands and sank on the bed, gasping for breath."
"We went this
morning to the shops to buy shoes for Polenka and Lida for theirs are
quite worn out."
"Only the money we’d reckoned wasn’t enough, not nearly
enough."
"And she picked out such dear little boots, for she has taste,
you don’t know."
"And there in the shop she burst out crying before the
shopmen because she hadn’t enough.... Ah, it was sad to see her....”

“Well, after that I can understand your living like this,” Raskolnikov
said with a bitter smile."
“And aren’t you sorry for them?
"Aren’t you sorry?” Sonia flew at him
again."
"“Why, I know, you gave your last penny yourself, though you’d
seen nothing of it, and if you’d seen everything, oh dear!"
"And how
often, how often I’ve brought her to tears!"
Only last week!
"Yes, I!"
"Only
a week before his death."
I was cruel!
And how often I’ve done it!
"Ah,
I’ve been wretched at the thought of it all day!”

Sonia wrung her hands as she spoke at the pain of remembering it."
"“You were cruel?”

“Yes, I--I. I went to see them,” she went on, weeping, “and father said,
‘read me something, Sonia, my head aches, read to me, here’s a book.’ He
had a book he had got from Andrey Semyonovitch Lebeziatnikov, he lives
there, he always used to get hold of such funny books."
"And I said, ‘I
can’t stay,’ as I didn’t want to read, and I’d gone in chiefly to show
Katerina Ivanovna some collars."
"Lizaveta, the pedlar, sold me some
collars and cuffs cheap, pretty, new, embroidered ones."
"Katerina
Ivanovna liked them very much; she put them on and looked at herself
in the glass and was delighted with them."
"‘Make me a present of them,
Sonia,’ she said, ‘please do.’ ‘_Please do_,’ she said, she wanted them
so much."
And when could she wear them?
"They just reminded her of her old
happy days."
"She looked at herself in the glass, admired herself, and she
has no clothes at all, no things of her own, hasn’t had all these years!"
"And she never asks anyone for anything; she is proud, she’d sooner give
away everything."
"And these she asked for, she liked them so much."
"And I
was sorry to give them."
"‘What use are they to you, Katerina Ivanovna?’ I
said."
"I spoke like that to her, I ought not to have said that!"
"She gave
me such a look."
"And she was so grieved, so grieved at my refusing her."
"And it was so sad to see.... And she was not grieved for the collars,
but for my refusing, I saw that."
"Ah, if only I could bring it all back,
change it, take back those words!"
"Ah, if I... but it’s nothing to you!”

“Did you know Lizaveta, the pedlar?”

“Yes.... Did you know her?” Sonia asked with some surprise."
"“Katerina Ivanovna is in consumption, rapid consumption; she will soon
die,” said Raskolnikov after a pause, without answering her question."
"“Oh, no, no, no!”

And Sonia unconsciously clutched both his hands, as though imploring
that she should not."
"“But it will be better if she does die.”

“No, not better, not at all better!” Sonia unconsciously repeated in
dismay."
“And the children?
"What can you do except take them to live with you?”

“Oh, I don’t know,” cried Sonia, almost in despair, and she put her
hands to her head."
"It was evident that that idea had very often occurred to her before and
he had only roused it again."
"“And, what, if even now, while Katerina Ivanovna is alive, you get ill
and are taken to the hospital, what will happen then?” he persisted
pitilessly."
“How can you?
"That cannot be!”

And Sonia’s face worked with awful terror."
“Cannot be?” Raskolnikov went on with a harsh smile.
"“You are not
insured against it, are you?"
What will happen to them then?
"They will
be in the street, all of them, she will cough and beg and knock her head
against some wall, as she did to-day, and the children will cry....
Then she will fall down, be taken to the police station and to the
hospital, she will die, and the children...”

“Oh, no.... God will not let it be!” broke at last from Sonia’s
overburdened bosom."
"She listened, looking imploringly at him, clasping her hands in dumb
entreaty, as though it all depended upon him."
Raskolnikov got up and began to walk about the room.
A minute passed.
"Sonia was standing with her hands and her head hanging in terrible
dejection."
“And can’t you save?
"Put by for a rainy day?” he asked, stopping
suddenly before her."
"“No,” whispered Sonia."
“Of course not.
Have you tried?” he added almost ironically.
"“Yes.”

“And it didn’t come off!"
Of course not!
"No need to ask.”

And again he paced the room."
Another minute passed.
"“You don’t get money every day?”

Sonia was more confused than ever and colour rushed into her face again."
"“No,” she whispered with a painful effort."
"“It will be the same with Polenka, no doubt,” he said suddenly."
"“No, no!"
"It can’t be, no!” Sonia cried aloud in desperation, as though
she had been stabbed."
"“God would not allow anything so awful!”

“He lets others come to it.”

“No, no!"
"God will protect her, God!” she repeated beside herself."
"“But, perhaps, there is no God at all,” Raskolnikov answered with a sort
of malignance, laughed and looked at her."
Sonia’s face suddenly changed; a tremor passed over it.
"She looked at
him with unutterable reproach, tried to say something, but could not
speak and broke into bitter, bitter sobs, hiding her face in her hands."
"“You say Katerina Ivanovna’s mind is unhinged; your own mind is
unhinged,” he said after a brief silence."
Five minutes passed.
"He still paced up and down the room in silence, not
looking at her."
At last he went up to her; his eyes glittered.
"He put
his two hands on her shoulders and looked straight into her tearful
face."
"His eyes were hard, feverish and piercing, his lips were
twitching."
"All at once he bent down quickly and dropping to the
ground, kissed her foot."
Sonia drew back from him as from a madman.
"And
certainly he looked like a madman."
"“What are you doing to me?” she muttered, turning pale, and a sudden
anguish clutched at her heart."
He stood up at once.
"“I did not bow down to you, I bowed down to all the suffering of
humanity,” he said wildly and walked away to the window."
"“Listen,” he
added, turning to her a minute later."
"“I said just now to an insolent
man that he was not worth your little finger... and that I did my sister
honour making her sit beside you.”

“Ach, you said that to them!"
"And in her presence?” cried Sonia,
frightened."
“Sit down with me!
An honour!
"Why, I’m... dishonourable....
Ah, why did you say that?”

“It was not because of your dishonour and your sin I said that of you,
but because of your great suffering."
"But you are a great sinner, that’s
true,” he added almost solemnly, “and your worst sin is that you have
destroyed and betrayed yourself _for nothing_."
Isn’t that fearful?
"Isn’t
it fearful that you are living in this filth which you loathe so, and at
the same time you know yourself (you’ve only to open your eyes) that you
are not helping anyone by it, not saving anyone from anything?"
"Tell me,”
 he went on almost in a frenzy, “how this shame and degradation can exist
in you side by side with other, opposite, holy feelings?"
"It would be
better, a thousand times better and wiser to leap into the water and end
it all!”

“But what would become of them?” Sonia asked faintly, gazing at him with
eyes of anguish, but not seeming surprised at his suggestion."
Raskolnikov looked strangely at her.
"He read it all in her face; so she
must have had that thought already, perhaps many times, and earnestly
she had thought out in her despair how to end it and so earnestly, that
now she scarcely wondered at his suggestion."
"She had not even noticed
the cruelty of his words."
"(The significance of his reproaches and his
peculiar attitude to her shame she had, of course, not noticed either,
and that, too, was clear to him.)"
"But he saw how monstrously the thought
of her disgraceful, shameful position was torturing her and had long
tortured her."
"“What, what,” he thought, “could hitherto have hindered
her from putting an end to it?” Only then he realised what those poor
little orphan children and that pitiful half-crazy Katerina Ivanovna,
knocking her head against the wall in her consumption, meant for Sonia."
"But, nevertheless, it was clear to him again that with her character and
the amount of education she had after all received, she could not in any
case remain so."
"He was still confronted by the question, how could she
have remained so long in that position without going out of her mind,
since she could not bring herself to jump into the water?"
"Of course he
knew that Sonia’s position was an exceptional case, though unhappily not
unique and not infrequent, indeed; but that very exceptionalness, her
tinge of education, her previous life might, one would have thought,
have killed her at the first step on that revolting path."
"What held her
up--surely not depravity?"
"All that infamy had obviously only touched
her mechanically, not one drop of real depravity had penetrated to her
heart; he saw that."
"He saw through her as she stood before him....

“There are three ways before her,” he thought, “the canal, the madhouse,
or... at last to sink into depravity which obscures the mind and turns
the heart to stone.”

The last idea was the most revolting, but he was a sceptic, he was
young, abstract, and therefore cruel, and so he could not help believing
that the last end was the most likely."
“But can that be true?” he cried to himself.
"“Can that creature who has
still preserved the purity of her spirit be consciously drawn at last
into that sink of filth and iniquity?"
"Can the process already have
begun?"
"Can it be that she has only been able to bear it till now,
because vice has begun to be less loathsome to her?"
"No, no, that cannot
be!” he cried, as Sonia had just before."
"“No, what has kept her from the
canal till now is the idea of sin and they, the children.... And if she
has not gone out of her mind... but who says she has not gone out of her
mind?"
Is she in her senses?
"Can one talk, can one reason as she does?"
"How can she sit on the edge of the abyss of loathsomeness into which she
is slipping and refuse to listen when she is told of danger?"
"Does she
expect a miracle?"
No doubt she does.
"Doesn’t that all mean madness?”

He stayed obstinately at that thought."
"He liked that explanation indeed
better than any other."
He began looking more intently at her.
"“So you pray to God a great deal, Sonia?” he asked her."
Sonia did not speak; he stood beside her waiting for an answer.
"“What should I be without God?” she whispered rapidly, forcibly,
glancing at him with suddenly flashing eyes, and squeezing his hand."
"“Ah, so that is it!” he thought."
"“And what does God do for you?” he asked, probing her further."
"Sonia was silent a long while, as though she could not answer."
"Her weak
chest kept heaving with emotion."
“Be silent!
Don’t ask!
"You don’t deserve!” she cried suddenly, looking
sternly and wrathfully at him."
"“That’s it, that’s it,” he repeated to himself."
"“He does everything,” she whispered quickly, looking down again."
“That’s the way out!
"That’s the explanation,” he decided, scrutinising
her with eager curiosity, with a new, strange, almost morbid feeling."
"He gazed at that pale, thin, irregular, angular little face, those soft
blue eyes, which could flash with such fire, such stern energy, that
little body still shaking with indignation and anger--and it all seemed
to him more and more strange, almost impossible."
"“She is a religious
maniac!” he repeated to himself."
There was a book lying on the chest of drawers.
"He had noticed it every
time he paced up and down the room."
Now he took it up and looked at it.
It was the New Testament in the Russian translation.
"It was bound in
leather, old and worn."
“Where did you get that?” he called to her across the room.
"She was still standing in the same place, three steps from the table."
"“It was brought me,” she answered, as it were unwillingly, not looking
at him."
"“Who brought it?”

“Lizaveta, I asked her for it.”

“Lizaveta!"
strange!” he thought.
"Everything about Sonia seemed to him stranger and more wonderful every
moment."
"He carried the book to the candle and began to turn over the
pages."
“Where is the story of Lazarus?” he asked suddenly.
Sonia looked obstinately at the ground and would not answer.
"She was
standing sideways to the table."
“Where is the raising of Lazarus?
"Find it for me, Sonia.”

She stole a glance at him."
"“You are not looking in the right place.... It’s in the fourth gospel,”
 she whispered sternly, without looking at him."
"“Find it and read it to me,” he said."
"He sat down with his elbow on the
table, leaned his head on his hand and looked away sullenly, prepared to
listen."
“In three weeks’ time they’ll welcome me in the madhouse!
"I shall be
there if I am not in a worse place,” he muttered to himself."
"Sonia heard Raskolnikov’s request distrustfully and moved hesitatingly
to the table."
She took the book however.
"“Haven’t you read it?” she asked, looking up at him across the table."
Her voice became sterner and sterner.
“Long ago....
When I was at school.
"Read!”

“And haven’t you heard it in church?”

“I... haven’t been."
"Do you often go?”

“N-no,” whispered Sonia."
Raskolnikov smiled.
"“I understand.... And you won’t go to your father’s funeral to-morrow?”

“Yes, I shall."
"I was at church last week, too..."
"I had a requiem
service.”

“For whom?”

“For Lizaveta."
"She was killed with an axe.”

His nerves were more and more strained."
His head began to go round.
"“Were you friends with Lizaveta?”

“Yes.... She was good... she used to come... not often... she
couldn’t.... We used to read together and... talk."
"She will see God.”

The last phrase sounded strange in his ears."
"And here was something new
again: the mysterious meetings with Lizaveta and both of them--religious
maniacs."
“I shall be a religious maniac myself soon!
"It’s infectious!”

“Read!” he cried irritably and insistently."
Sonia still hesitated.
Her heart was throbbing.
"She hardly dared to read
to him."
"He looked almost with exasperation at the “unhappy lunatic.”

“What for?"
"You don’t believe?...” she whispered softly and as it were
breathlessly."
“Read!
"I want you to,” he persisted."
"“You used to read to Lizaveta.”

Sonia opened the book and found the place."
"Her hands were shaking, her
voice failed her."
"Twice she tried to begin and could not bring out the
first syllable."
"“Now a certain man was sick named Lazarus of Bethany...” she forced
herself at last to read, but at the third word her voice broke like an
overstrained string."
There was a catch in her breath.
"Raskolnikov saw in part why Sonia could not bring herself to read to him
and the more he saw this, the more roughly and irritably he insisted on
her doing so."
"He understood only too well how painful it was for her
to betray and unveil all that was her _own_."
"He understood that these
feelings really were her _secret treasure_, which she had kept perhaps
for years, perhaps from childhood, while she lived with an unhappy
father and a distracted stepmother crazed by grief, in the midst of
starving children and unseemly abuse and reproaches."
"But at the same
time he knew now and knew for certain that, although it filled her with
dread and suffering, yet she had a tormenting desire to read and to read
to _him_ that he might hear it, and to read _now_ whatever might come of
it!..."
"He read this in her eyes, he could see it in her intense emotion."
"She mastered herself, controlled the spasm in her throat and went on
reading the eleventh chapter of St. John."
"She went on to the nineteenth
verse:

“And many of the Jews came to Martha and Mary to comfort them concerning
their brother."
"“Then Martha as soon as she heard that Jesus was coming went and met
Him: but Mary sat still in the house."
"“Then said Martha unto Jesus, Lord, if Thou hadst been here, my brother
had not died."
"“But I know that even now whatsoever Thou wilt ask of God, God will give
it Thee....”

Then she stopped again with a shamefaced feeling that her voice would
quiver and break again."
"“Jesus said unto her, thy brother shall rise again."
"“Martha saith unto Him, I know that he shall rise again in the
resurrection, at the last day."
"“Jesus said unto her, I am the resurrection and the life: he that
believeth in Me though he were dead, yet shall he live."
“And whosoever liveth and believeth in Me shall never die.
"Believest
thou this?"
"“She saith unto Him,”

(And drawing a painful breath, Sonia read distinctly and forcibly as
though she were making a public confession of faith.)"
"“Yea, Lord: I believe that Thou art the Christ, the Son of God Which
should come into the world.”

She stopped and looked up quickly at him, but controlling herself went
on reading."
"Raskolnikov sat without moving, his elbows on the table and
his eyes turned away."
She read to the thirty-second verse.
"“Then when Mary was come where Jesus was and saw Him, she fell down at
His feet, saying unto Him, Lord if Thou hadst been here, my brother had
not died."
"“When Jesus therefore saw her weeping, and the Jews also weeping which
came with her, He groaned in the spirit and was troubled,

“And said, Where have ye laid him?"
"They said unto Him, Lord, come and
see."
“Jesus wept.
"“Then said the Jews, behold how He loved him!"
"“And some of them said, could not this Man which opened the eyes of the
blind, have caused that even this man should not have died?”

Raskolnikov turned and looked at her with emotion."
"Yes, he had known it!"
She was trembling in a real physical fever.
He had expected it.
"She was
getting near the story of the greatest miracle and a feeling of immense
triumph came over her."
"Her voice rang out like a bell; triumph and joy
gave it power."
"The lines danced before her eyes, but she knew what she
was reading by heart."
"At the last verse “Could not this Man which opened
the eyes of the blind...” dropping her voice she passionately reproduced
the doubt, the reproach and censure of the blind disbelieving Jews, who
in another moment would fall at His feet as though struck by
thunder, sobbing and believing.... “And _he, he_--too, is blinded and
unbelieving, he, too, will hear, he, too, will believe, yes, yes!"
"At
once, now,” was what she was dreaming, and she was quivering with happy
anticipation."
“Jesus therefore again groaning in Himself cometh to the grave.
"It was a
cave, and a stone lay upon it."
"“Jesus said, Take ye away the stone."
"Martha, the sister of him that was
dead, saith unto Him, Lord by this time he stinketh: for he hath been
dead four days.”

She laid emphasis on the word _four_."
"“Jesus saith unto her, Said I not unto thee that if thou wouldest
believe, thou shouldest see the glory of God?"
“Then they took away the stone from the place where the dead was laid.
"And Jesus lifted up His eyes and said, Father, I thank Thee that Thou
hast heard Me."
"“And I knew that Thou hearest Me always; but because of the people which
stand by I said it, that they may believe that Thou hast sent Me."
"“And when He thus had spoken, He cried with a loud voice, Lazarus, come
forth."
"“And he that was dead came forth.”

(She read loudly, cold and trembling with ecstasy, as though she were
seeing it before her eyes.)"
"“Bound hand and foot with graveclothes; and his face was bound about
with a napkin."
"Jesus saith unto them, Loose him and let him go."
"“Then many of the Jews which came to Mary and had seen the things which
Jesus did believed on Him.”

She could read no more, closed the book and got up from her chair
quickly."
"“That is all about the raising of Lazarus,” she whispered severely and
abruptly, and turning away she stood motionless, not daring to raise
her eyes to him."
She still trembled feverishly.
"The candle-end was
flickering out in the battered candlestick, dimly lighting up in the
poverty-stricken room the murderer and the harlot who had so strangely
been reading together the eternal book."
Five minutes or more passed.
"“I came to speak of something,” Raskolnikov said aloud, frowning."
"He got
up and went to Sonia."
She lifted her eyes to him in silence.
"His face
was particularly stern and there was a sort of savage determination in
it."
"“I have abandoned my family to-day,” he said, “my mother and sister."
"I
am not going to see them."
"I’ve broken with them completely.”

“What for?” asked Sonia amazed."
"Her recent meeting with his mother and
sister had left a great impression which she could not analyse."
"She
heard his news almost with horror."
"“I have only you now,” he added."
"“Let us go together.... I’ve come to
you, we are both accursed, let us go our way together!”

His eyes glittered “as though he were mad,” Sonia thought, in her turn."
“Go where?” she asked in alarm and she involuntarily stepped back.
“How do I know?
"I only know it’s the same road, I know that and nothing
more."
"It’s the same goal!”

She looked at him and understood nothing."
"She knew only that he was
terribly, infinitely unhappy."
"“No one of them will understand, if you tell them, but I have
understood."
"I need you, that is why I have come to you.”

“I don’t understand,” whispered Sonia."
“You’ll understand later.
Haven’t you done the same?
"You, too, have
transgressed... have had the strength to transgress."
"You have laid
hands on yourself, you have destroyed a life... _your own_ (it’s all the
same!)."
"You might have lived in spirit and understanding, but you’ll
end in the Hay Market...."
"But you won’t be able to stand it, and if
you remain alone you’ll go out of your mind like me."
"You are like a mad
creature already."
So we must go together on the same road!
"Let us go!”

“What for?"
"What’s all this for?” said Sonia, strangely and violently
agitated by his words."
“What for?
"Because you can’t remain like this, that’s why!"
"You must look
things straight in the face at last, and not weep like a child and cry
that God won’t allow it."
"What will happen, if you should really be taken
to the hospital to-morrow?"
"She is mad and in consumption, she’ll soon
die and the children?"
"Do you mean to tell me Polenka won’t come to
grief?"
"Haven’t you seen children here at the street corners sent out
by their mothers to beg?"
"I’ve found out where those mothers live and in
what surroundings."
Children can’t remain children there!
"At seven the
child is vicious and a thief."
"Yet children, you know, are the image of
Christ: ‘theirs is the kingdom of Heaven.’ He bade us honour and love
them, they are the humanity of the future....”

“What’s to be done, what’s to be done?” repeated Sonia, weeping
hysterically and wringing her hands."
“What’s to be done?
"Break what must be broken, once for all, that’s all,
and take the suffering on oneself."
"What, you don’t understand?"
"You’ll
understand later.... Freedom and power, and above all, power!"
"Over all
trembling creation and all the ant-heap!..."
"That’s the goal, remember
that!"
That’s my farewell message.
"Perhaps it’s the last time I shall
speak to you."
"If I don’t come to-morrow, you’ll hear of it all, and then
remember these words."
"And some day later on, in years to come, you’ll
understand perhaps what they meant."
"If I come to-morrow, I’ll tell you
who killed Lizaveta.... Good-bye.”

Sonia started with terror."
"“Why, do you know who killed her?” she asked, chilled with horror,
looking wildly at him."
"“I know and will tell... you, only you."
I have chosen you out.
"I’m not
coming to you to ask forgiveness, but simply to tell you."
"I chose you
out long ago to hear this, when your father talked of you and when
Lizaveta was alive, I thought of it."
"Good-bye, don’t shake hands."
"To-morrow!”

He went out."
Sonia gazed at him as at a madman.
"But she herself was like
one insane and felt it."
Her head was going round.
"“Good heavens, how does he know who killed Lizaveta?"
"What did those
words mean?"
"It’s awful!” But at the same time _the idea_ did not enter
her head, not for a moment!"
"“Oh, he must be terribly unhappy!..."
"He has
abandoned his mother and sister.... What for?"
What has happened?
"And
what had he in his mind?"
What did he say to her?
"He had kissed her foot
and said... said (yes, he had said it clearly) that he could not live
without her.... Oh, merciful heavens!”

Sonia spent the whole night feverish and delirious."
"She jumped up from
time to time, wept and wrung her hands, then sank again into feverish
sleep and dreamt of Polenka, Katerina Ivanovna and Lizaveta, of reading
the gospel and him... him with pale face, with burning eyes... kissing
her feet, weeping."
"On the other side of the door on the right, which divided Sonia’s room
from Madame Resslich’s flat, was a room which had long stood empty."
"A
card was fixed on the gate and a notice stuck in the windows over the
canal advertising it to let."
"Sonia had long been accustomed to the
room’s being uninhabited."
"But all that time Mr. Svidrigaïlov had been
standing, listening at the door of the empty room."
"When Raskolnikov went
out he stood still, thought a moment, went on tiptoe to his own room
which adjoined the empty one, brought a chair and noiselessly carried it
to the door that led to Sonia’s room."
"The conversation had struck him
as interesting and remarkable, and he had greatly enjoyed it--so much so
that he brought a chair that he might not in the future, to-morrow, for
instance, have to endure the inconvenience of standing a whole hour, but
might listen in comfort."
"CHAPTER V

When next morning at eleven o’clock punctually Raskolnikov went into the
department of the investigation of criminal causes and sent his name in
to Porfiry Petrovitch, he was surprised at being kept waiting so long:
it was at least ten minutes before he was summoned."
"He had expected
that they would pounce upon him."
"But he stood in the waiting-room, and
people, who apparently had nothing to do with him, were continually
passing to and fro before him."
"In the next room which looked like an
office, several clerks were sitting writing and obviously they had
no notion who or what Raskolnikov might be."
"He looked uneasily and
suspiciously about him to see whether there was not some guard, some
mysterious watch being kept on him to prevent his escape."
"But there was
nothing of the sort: he saw only the faces of clerks absorbed in petty
details, then other people, no one seemed to have any concern with him."
He might go where he liked for them.
"The conviction grew stronger in him
that if that enigmatic man of yesterday, that phantom sprung out of the
earth, had seen everything, they would not have let him stand and wait
like that."
"And would they have waited till he elected to appear at
eleven?"
"Either the man had not yet given information, or... or simply
he knew nothing, had seen nothing (and how could he have seen anything?)"
"and so all that had happened to him the day before was again a phantom
exaggerated by his sick and overstrained imagination."
"This conjecture
had begun to grow strong the day before, in the midst of all his
alarm and despair."
"Thinking it all over now and preparing for a fresh
conflict, he was suddenly aware that he was trembling--and he felt a
rush of indignation at the thought that he was trembling with fear at
facing that hateful Porfiry Petrovitch."
"What he dreaded above all was
meeting that man again; he hated him with an intense, unmitigated hatred
and was afraid his hatred might betray him."
"His indignation was such
that he ceased trembling at once; he made ready to go in with a cold and
arrogant bearing and vowed to himself to keep as silent as possible,
to watch and listen and for once at least to control his overstrained
nerves."
At that moment he was summoned to Porfiry Petrovitch.
He found Porfiry Petrovitch alone in his study.
"His study was a room
neither large nor small, furnished with a large writing-table, that
stood before a sofa, upholstered in checked material, a bureau, a
bookcase in the corner and several chairs--all government furniture,
of polished yellow wood."
"In the further wall there was a closed door,
beyond it there were no doubt other rooms."
"On Raskolnikov’s entrance
Porfiry Petrovitch had at once closed the door by which he had come in
and they remained alone."
"He met his visitor with an apparently genial
and good-tempered air, and it was only after a few minutes that
Raskolnikov saw signs of a certain awkwardness in him, as though he had
been thrown out of his reckoning or caught in something very secret."
"“Ah, my dear fellow!"
"Here you are... in our domain”... began Porfiry,
holding out both hands to him."
"“Come, sit down, old man... or perhaps
you don’t like to be called ‘my dear fellow’ and ‘old man!’--_tout
court_?"
Please don’t think it too familiar....
"Here, on the sofa.”

Raskolnikov sat down, keeping his eyes fixed on him."
"“In our domain,”
 the apologies for familiarity, the French phrase _tout court_, were all
characteristic signs."
"“He held out both hands to me, but he did not give me one--he drew it
back in time,” struck him suspiciously."
"Both were watching each other,
but when their eyes met, quick as lightning they looked away."
“I brought you this paper... about the watch.
Here it is.
"Is it all
right or shall I copy it again?”

“What?"
A paper?
"Yes, yes, don’t be uneasy, it’s all right,” Porfiry
Petrovitch said as though in haste, and after he had said it he took the
paper and looked at it."
"“Yes, it’s all right."
"Nothing more is needed,”
 he declared with the same rapidity and he laid the paper on the table."
"A minute later when he was talking of something else he took it from the
table and put it on his bureau."
"“I believe you said yesterday you would like to question me...
formally... about my acquaintance with the murdered woman?” Raskolnikov
was beginning again."
"“Why did I put in ‘I believe’” passed through
his mind in a flash."
"“Why am I so uneasy at having put in that ‘_I
believe_’?” came in a second flash."
"And he suddenly felt that his
uneasiness at the mere contact with Porfiry, at the first words, at the
first looks, had grown in an instant to monstrous proportions, and that
this was fearfully dangerous."
"His nerves were quivering, his emotion was
increasing."
"“It’s bad, it’s bad!"
"I shall say too much again.”

“Yes, yes, yes!"
"There’s no hurry, there’s no hurry,” muttered Porfiry
Petrovitch, moving to and fro about the table without any apparent aim,
as it were making dashes towards the window, the bureau and the table,
at one moment avoiding Raskolnikov’s suspicious glance, then again
standing still and looking him straight in the face."
"His fat round little figure looked very strange, like a ball rolling
from one side to the other and rebounding back."
“We’ve plenty of time.
Do you smoke?
have you your own?
"Here, a
cigarette!” he went on, offering his visitor a cigarette."
"“You know I am
receiving you here, but my own quarters are through there, you know, my
government quarters."
"But I am living outside for the time, I had to
have some repairs done here."
"It’s almost finished now.... Government
quarters, you know, are a capital thing."
"Eh, what do you think?”

“Yes, a capital thing,” answered Raskolnikov, looking at him almost
ironically."
"“A capital thing, a capital thing,” repeated Porfiry Petrovitch, as
though he had just thought of something quite different."
"“Yes, a capital
thing,” he almost shouted at last, suddenly staring at Raskolnikov and
stopping short two steps from him."
"This stupid repetition was too incongruous in its ineptitude with the
serious, brooding and enigmatic glance he turned upon his visitor."
"But this stirred Raskolnikov’s spleen more than ever and he could not
resist an ironical and rather incautious challenge."
"“Tell me, please,” he asked suddenly, looking almost insolently at him
and taking a kind of pleasure in his own insolence."
"“I believe it’s a
sort of legal rule, a sort of legal tradition--for all investigating
lawyers--to begin their attack from afar, with a trivial, or at least
an irrelevant subject, so as to encourage, or rather, to divert the man
they are cross-examining, to disarm his caution and then all at once to
give him an unexpected knock-down blow with some fatal question."
"Isn’t
that so?"
"It’s a sacred tradition, mentioned, I fancy, in all the manuals
of the art?”

“Yes, yes.... Why, do you imagine that was why I spoke about government
quarters... eh?”

And as he said this Porfiry Petrovitch screwed up his eyes and winked;
a good-humoured, crafty look passed over his face."
"The wrinkles on his
forehead were smoothed out, his eyes contracted, his features broadened
and he suddenly went off into a nervous prolonged laugh, shaking all
over and looking Raskolnikov straight in the face."
"The latter forced
himself to laugh, too, but when Porfiry, seeing that he was laughing,
broke into such a guffaw that he turned almost crimson, Raskolnikov’s
repulsion overcame all precaution; he left off laughing, scowled and
stared with hatred at Porfiry, keeping his eyes fixed on him while his
intentionally prolonged laughter lasted."
"There was lack of precaution on
both sides, however, for Porfiry Petrovitch seemed to be laughing in
his visitor’s face and to be very little disturbed at the annoyance with
which the visitor received it."
"The latter fact was very significant
in Raskolnikov’s eyes: he saw that Porfiry Petrovitch had not been
embarrassed just before either, but that he, Raskolnikov, had perhaps
fallen into a trap; that there must be something, some motive here
unknown to him; that, perhaps, everything was in readiness and in
another moment would break upon him..."
"He went straight to the point at once, rose from his seat and took his
cap."
"“Porfiry Petrovitch,” he began resolutely, though with considerable
irritation, “yesterday you expressed a desire that I should come to you
for some inquiries” (he laid special stress on the word “inquiries”)."
"“I
have come and if you have anything to ask me, ask it, and if not, allow
me to withdraw."
I have no time to spare....
"I have to be at the funeral
of that man who was run over, of whom you... know also,” he added,
feeling angry at once at having made this addition and more irritated at
his anger."
"“I am sick of it all, do you hear?"
and have long been.
"It’s
partly what made me ill."
"In short,” he shouted, feeling that the phrase
about his illness was still more out of place, “in short, kindly examine
me or let me go, at once."
"And if you must examine me, do so in the
proper form!"
"I will not allow you to do so otherwise, and so meanwhile,
good-bye, as we have evidently nothing to keep us now.”

“Good heavens!"
What do you mean?
"What shall I question you about?”
 cackled Porfiry Petrovitch with a change of tone, instantly leaving off
laughing."
"“Please don’t disturb yourself,” he began fidgeting from place
to place and fussily making Raskolnikov sit down."
"“There’s no hurry,
there’s no hurry, it’s all nonsense."
"Oh, no, I’m very glad you’ve come
to see me at last..."
I look upon you simply as a visitor.
"And as for
my confounded laughter, please excuse it, Rodion Romanovitch."
"Rodion
Romanovitch?"
That is your name?...
"It’s my nerves, you tickled me
so with your witty observation; I assure you, sometimes I shake with
laughter like an india-rubber ball for half an hour at a time.... I’m
often afraid of an attack of paralysis."
Do sit down.
"Please do, or I
shall think you are angry...”

Raskolnikov did not speak; he listened, watching him, still frowning
angrily."
"He did sit down, but still held his cap."
"“I must tell you one thing about myself, my dear Rodion Romanovitch,”
 Porfiry Petrovitch continued, moving about the room and again avoiding
his visitor’s eyes."
"“You see, I’m a bachelor, a man of no consequence
and not used to society; besides, I have nothing before me, I’m set, I’m
running to seed and... and have you noticed, Rodion Romanovitch, that in
our Petersburg circles, if two clever men meet who are not intimate, but
respect each other, like you and me, it takes them half an hour before
they can find a subject for conversation--they are dumb, they sit
opposite each other and feel awkward."
"Everyone has subjects of
conversation, ladies for instance... people in high society always have
their subjects of conversation, _c’est de rigueur_, but people of the
middle sort like us, thinking people that is, are always tongue-tied
and awkward."
What is the reason of it?
"Whether it is the lack of public
interest, or whether it is we are so honest we don’t want to deceive one
another, I don’t know."
What do you think?
"Do put down your cap, it
looks as if you were just going, it makes me uncomfortable..."
"I am so
delighted...”

Raskolnikov put down his cap and continued listening in silence with
a serious frowning face to the vague and empty chatter of Porfiry
Petrovitch."
"“Does he really want to distract my attention with his silly
babble?”

“I can’t offer you coffee here; but why not spend five minutes with a
friend?” Porfiry pattered on, “and you know all these official
duties... please don’t mind my running up and down, excuse it, my dear
fellow, I am very much afraid of offending you, but exercise is
absolutely indispensable for me."
"I’m always sitting and so glad to be
moving about for five minutes..."
I suffer from my sedentary life...
"I
always intend to join a gymnasium; they say that officials of all ranks,
even Privy Councillors, may be seen skipping gaily there; there you have
it, modern science... yes, yes...."
"But as for my duties here, inquiries
and all such formalities... you mentioned inquiries yourself just now..."
"I assure you these interrogations are sometimes more embarrassing for
the interrogator than for the interrogated.... You made the observation
yourself just now very aptly and wittily.” (Raskolnikov had made no
observation of the kind.)"
“One gets into a muddle!
A regular muddle!
"One
keeps harping on the same note, like a drum!"
"There is to be a reform and
we shall be called by a different name, at least, he-he-he!"
"And as for
our legal tradition, as you so wittily called it, I thoroughly agree
with you."
"Every prisoner on trial, even the rudest peasant, knows that
they begin by disarming him with irrelevant questions (as you so happily
put it) and then deal him a knock-down blow, he-he-he!--your felicitous
comparison, he-he!"
"So you really imagined that I meant by ‘government
quarters’... he-he!"
You are an ironical person.
Come.
I won’t go on!
"Ah,
by the way, yes!"
One word leads to another.
"You spoke of formality just
now, apropos of the inquiry, you know."
But what’s the use of formality?
In many cases it’s nonsense.
"Sometimes one has a friendly chat and gets
a good deal more out of it."
"One can always fall back on formality, allow
me to assure you."
"And after all, what does it amount to?"
"An examining
lawyer cannot be bounded by formality at every step."
"The work of
investigation is, so to speak, a free art in its own way, he-he-he!”

Porfiry Petrovitch took breath a moment."
"He had simply babbled on
uttering empty phrases, letting slip a few enigmatic words and again
reverting to incoherence."
"He was almost running about the room, moving
his fat little legs quicker and quicker, looking at the ground, with his
right hand behind his back, while with his left making gesticulations
that were extraordinarily incongruous with his words."
"Raskolnikov
suddenly noticed that as he ran about the room he seemed twice to stop
for a moment near the door, as though he were listening."
"“Is he expecting anything?”

“You are certainly quite right about it,” Porfiry began gaily, looking
with extraordinary simplicity at Raskolnikov (which startled him and
instantly put him on his guard); “certainly quite right in laughing so
wittily at our legal forms, he-he!"
"Some of these elaborate psychological
methods are exceedingly ridiculous and perhaps useless, if one adheres
too closely to the forms."
Yes...
I am talking of forms again.
"Well, if
I recognise, or more strictly speaking, if I suspect someone or other to
be a criminal in any case entrusted to me... you’re reading for the law,
of course, Rodion Romanovitch?”

“Yes, I was...”

“Well, then it is a precedent for you for the future--though don’t
suppose I should venture to instruct you after the articles you publish
about crime!"
"No, I simply make bold to state it by way of fact, if I
took this man or that for a criminal, why, I ask, should I worry him
prematurely, even though I had evidence against him?"
"In one case I may
be bound, for instance, to arrest a man at once, but another may be in
quite a different position, you know, so why shouldn’t I let him walk
about the town a bit?"
he-he-he!
"But I see you don’t quite understand, so
I’ll give you a clearer example."
"If I put him in prison too soon, I
may very likely give him, so to speak, moral support, he-he!"
"You’re
laughing?”

Raskolnikov had no idea of laughing."
"He was sitting with compressed
lips, his feverish eyes fixed on Porfiry Petrovitch’s."
"“Yet that is the case, with some types especially, for men are so
different."
You say ‘evidence’.
"Well, there may be evidence."
"But
evidence, you know, can generally be taken two ways."
"I am an examining
lawyer and a weak man, I confess it."
"I should like to make a proof, so
to say, mathematically clear."
"I should like to make a chain of evidence
such as twice two are four, it ought to be a direct, irrefutable proof!"
"And if I shut him up too soon--even though I might be convinced _he_
was the man, I should very likely be depriving myself of the means of
getting further evidence against him."
And how?
"By giving him, so to
speak, a definite position, I shall put him out of suspense and set his
mind at rest, so that he will retreat into his shell."
"They say that at
Sevastopol, soon after Alma, the clever people were in a terrible fright
that the enemy would attack openly and take Sevastopol at once."
"But when
they saw that the enemy preferred a regular siege, they were delighted,
I am told and reassured, for the thing would drag on for two months at
least."
"You’re laughing, you don’t believe me again?"
"Of course, you’re
right, too."
"You’re right, you’re right."
"These are special cases, I
admit."
"But you must observe this, my dear Rodion Romanovitch, the
general case, the case for which all legal forms and rules are intended,
for which they are calculated and laid down in books, does not exist at
all, for the reason that every case, every crime, for instance, so soon
as it actually occurs, at once becomes a thoroughly special case and
sometimes a case unlike any that’s gone before."
"Very comic cases of that
sort sometimes occur."
"If I leave one man quite alone, if I don’t touch
him and don’t worry him, but let him know or at least suspect every
moment that I know all about it and am watching him day and night, and
if he is in continual suspicion and terror, he’ll be bound to lose his
head."
"He’ll come of himself, or maybe do something which will make it as
plain as twice two are four--it’s delightful."
"It may be so with a simple
peasant, but with one of our sort, an intelligent man cultivated on a
certain side, it’s a dead certainty."
"For, my dear fellow, it’s a very
important matter to know on what side a man is cultivated."
"And then
there are nerves, there are nerves, you have overlooked them!"
"Why, they
are all sick, nervous and irritable!..."
"And then how they all suffer
from spleen!"
That I assure you is a regular gold-mine for us.
"And it’s
no anxiety to me, his running about the town free!"
"Let him, let him walk
about for a bit!"
"I know well enough that I’ve caught him and that he
won’t escape me."
"Where could he escape to, he-he?"
"Abroad, perhaps?"
"A
Pole will escape abroad, but not here, especially as I am watching
and have taken measures."
"Will he escape into the depths of the country
perhaps?"
"But you know, peasants live there, real rude Russian peasants."
"A modern cultivated man would prefer prison to living with such
strangers as our peasants."
He-he!
"But that’s all nonsense, and on
the surface."
"It’s not merely that he has nowhere to run to, he is
_psychologically_ unable to escape me, he-he!"
What an expression!
Through a law of nature he can’t escape me if he had anywhere to go.
Have you seen a butterfly round a candle?
"That’s how he will keep
circling and circling round me."
Freedom will lose its attractions.
"He’ll
begin to brood, he’ll weave a tangle round himself, he’ll worry himself
to death!"
"What’s more he will provide me with a mathematical proof--if I
only give him long enough interval.... And he’ll keep circling round
me, getting nearer and nearer and then--flop!"
"He’ll fly straight into my
mouth and I’ll swallow him, and that will be very amusing, he-he-he!"
"You
don’t believe me?”

Raskolnikov made no reply; he sat pale and motionless, still gazing with
the same intensity into Porfiry’s face."
"“It’s a lesson,” he thought, turning cold."
"“This is beyond the cat
playing with a mouse, like yesterday."
"He can’t be showing off his power
with no motive... prompting me; he is far too clever for that... he must
have another object."
What is it?
"It’s all nonsense, my friend, you are
pretending, to scare me!"
"You’ve no proofs and the man I saw had no
real existence."
"You simply want to make me lose my head, to work me up
beforehand and so to crush me."
"But you are wrong, you won’t do it!"
"But
why give me such a hint?"
Is he reckoning on my shattered nerves?
"No, my
friend, you are wrong, you won’t do it even though you have some trap
for me... let us see what you have in store for me.”

And he braced himself to face a terrible and unknown ordeal."
"At times
he longed to fall on Porfiry and strangle him."
"This anger was what he
dreaded from the beginning."
"He felt that his parched lips were flecked
with foam, his heart was throbbing."
"But he was still determined not to
speak till the right moment."
"He realised that this was the best
policy in his position, because instead of saying too much he would be
irritating his enemy by his silence and provoking him into speaking too
freely."
"Anyhow, this was what he hoped for."
"“No, I see you don’t believe me, you think I am playing a harmless joke
on you,” Porfiry began again, getting more and more lively, chuckling
at every instant and again pacing round the room."
"“And to be sure you’re
right: God has given me a figure that can awaken none but comic ideas in
other people; a buffoon; but let me tell you, and I repeat it, excuse
an old man, my dear Rodion Romanovitch, you are a man still young, so to
say, in your first youth and so you put intellect above everything, like
all young people."
"Playful wit and abstract arguments fascinate you and
that’s for all the world like the old Austrian _Hof-kriegsrath_, as
far as I can judge of military matters, that is: on paper they’d beaten
Napoleon and taken him prisoner, and there in their study they worked it
all out in the cleverest fashion, but look you, General Mack surrendered
with all his army, he-he-he!"
"I see, I see, Rodion Romanovitch, you are
laughing at a civilian like me, taking examples out of military history!"
"But I can’t help it, it’s my weakness."
I am fond of military science.
And I’m ever so fond of reading all military histories.
"I’ve certainly
missed my proper career."
"I ought to have been in the army, upon my
word I ought."
"I shouldn’t have been a Napoleon, but I might have been a
major, he-he!"
"Well, I’ll tell you the whole truth, my dear fellow, about
this _special case_, I mean: actual fact and a man’s temperament, my
dear sir, are weighty matters and it’s astonishing how they sometimes
deceive the sharpest calculation!"
"I--listen to an old man--am speaking
seriously, Rodion Romanovitch” (as he said this Porfiry Petrovitch, who
was scarcely five-and-thirty, actually seemed to have grown old; even
his voice changed and he seemed to shrink together) “Moreover, I’m
a candid man... am I a candid man or not?"
What do you say?
"I fancy I
really am: I tell you these things for nothing and don’t even expect a
reward for it, he-he!"
"Well, to proceed, wit in my opinion is a splendid
thing, it is, so to say, an adornment of nature and a consolation of
life, and what tricks it can play!"
"So that it sometimes is hard for a
poor examining lawyer to know where he is, especially when he’s liable
to be carried away by his own fancy, too, for you know he is a man after
all!"
"But the poor fellow is saved by the criminal’s temperament, worse
luck for him!"
"But young people carried away by their own wit don’t think
of that ‘when they overstep all obstacles,’ as you wittily and cleverly
expressed it yesterday."
"He will lie--that is, the man who is a _special
case_, the incognito, and he will lie well, in the cleverest fashion;
you might think he would triumph and enjoy the fruits of his wit, but at
the most interesting, the most flagrant moment he will faint."
"Of course
there may be illness and a stuffy room as well, but anyway!"
"Anyway he’s
given us the idea!"
"He lied incomparably, but he didn’t reckon on his
temperament."
That’s what betrays him!
"Another time he will be carried
away by his playful wit into making fun of the man who suspects him, he
will turn pale as it were on purpose to mislead, but his paleness will
be _too natural_, too much like the real thing, again he has given us
an idea!"
"Though his questioner may be deceived at first, he will think
differently next day if he is not a fool, and, of course, it is like
that at every step!"
"He puts himself forward where he is not wanted,
speaks continually when he ought to keep silent, brings in all sorts of
allegorical allusions, he-he!"
"Comes and asks why didn’t you take me long
ago?"
he-he-he!
"And that can happen, you know, with the cleverest man,
the psychologist, the literary man."
"The temperament reflects everything
like a mirror!"
Gaze into it and admire what you see!
"But why are you so
pale, Rodion Romanovitch?"
Is the room stuffy?
"Shall I open the window?”

“Oh, don’t trouble, please,” cried Raskolnikov and he suddenly broke
into a laugh."
"“Please don’t trouble.”

Porfiry stood facing him, paused a moment and suddenly he too laughed."
"Raskolnikov got up from the sofa, abruptly checking his hysterical
laughter."
"“Porfiry Petrovitch,” he began, speaking loudly and distinctly, though
his legs trembled and he could scarcely stand."
"“I see clearly at last
that you actually suspect me of murdering that old woman and her sister
Lizaveta."
Let me tell you for my part that I am sick of this.
"If you
find that you have a right to prosecute me legally, to arrest me, then
prosecute me, arrest me."
"But I will not let myself be jeered at to my
face and worried...”

His lips trembled, his eyes glowed with fury and he could not restrain
his voice."
"“I won’t allow it!” he shouted, bringing his fist down on the table."
"“Do
you hear that, Porfiry Petrovitch?"
"I won’t allow it.”

“Good heavens!"
"What does it mean?” cried Porfiry Petrovitch, apparently
quite frightened."
"“Rodion Romanovitch, my dear fellow, what is the
matter with you?”

“I won’t allow it,” Raskolnikov shouted again."
"“Hush, my dear man!"
They’ll hear and come in.
"Just think, what could we
say to them?” Porfiry Petrovitch whispered in horror, bringing his face
close to Raskolnikov’s."
"“I won’t allow it, I won’t allow it,” Raskolnikov repeated mechanically,
but he too spoke in a sudden whisper."
Porfiry turned quickly and ran to open the window.
“Some fresh air!
"And you must have some water, my dear fellow."
"You’re
ill!” and he was running to the door to call for some when he found a
decanter of water in the corner."
"“Come, drink a little,” he whispered,
rushing up to him with the decanter."
"“It will be sure to do you good.”

Porfiry Petrovitch’s alarm and sympathy were so natural that Raskolnikov
was silent and began looking at him with wild curiosity."
"He did not take
the water, however."
"“Rodion Romanovitch, my dear fellow, you’ll drive yourself out of your
mind, I assure you, ach, ach!"
"Have some water, do drink a little.”

He forced him to take the glass."
"Raskolnikov raised it mechanically to
his lips, but set it on the table again with disgust."
"“Yes, you’ve had a little attack!"
"You’ll bring back your illness again,
my dear fellow,” Porfiry Petrovitch cackled with friendly sympathy,
though he still looked rather disconcerted."
"“Good heavens, you must
take more care of yourself!"
"Dmitri Prokofitch was here, came to see me
yesterday--I know, I know, I’ve a nasty, ironical temper, but what they
made of it!..."
"Good heavens, he came yesterday after you’d been."
"We
dined and he talked and talked away, and I could only throw up my hands
in despair!"
Did he come from you?
"But do sit down, for mercy’s sake, sit
down!”

“No, not from me, but I knew he went to you and why he went,”
 Raskolnikov answered sharply."
"“You knew?”

“I knew."
"What of it?”

“Why this, Rodion Romanovitch, that I know more than that about you;
I know about everything."
"I know how you went _to take a flat_ at night
when it was dark and how you rang the bell and asked about the blood, so
that the workmen and the porter did not know what to make of it."
"Yes, I
understand your state of mind at that time... but you’ll drive yourself
mad like that, upon my word!"
You’ll lose your head!
"You’re full of
generous indignation at the wrongs you’ve received, first from destiny,
and then from the police officers, and so you rush from one thing to
another to force them to speak out and make an end of it all, because
you are sick of all this suspicion and foolishness."
"That’s so, isn’t
it?"
"I have guessed how you feel, haven’t I?"
"Only in that way you’ll
lose your head and Razumihin’s, too; he’s too _good_ a man for such
a position, you must know that."
"You are ill and he is good and your
illness is infectious for him... I’ll tell you about it when you are
more yourself...."
"But do sit down, for goodness’ sake."
"Please rest, you
look shocking, do sit down.”

Raskolnikov sat down; he no longer shivered, he was hot all over."
"In
amazement he listened with strained attention to Porfiry Petrovitch who
still seemed frightened as he looked after him with friendly solicitude."
"But he did not believe a word he said, though he felt a strange
inclination to believe."
"Porfiry’s unexpected words about the flat had
utterly overwhelmed him."
"“How can it be, he knows about the flat then,”
 he thought suddenly, “and he tells it me himself!”

“Yes, in our legal practice there was a case almost exactly similar, a
case of morbid psychology,” Porfiry went on quickly."
"“A man confessed to
murder and how he kept it up!"
"It was a regular hallucination; he brought
forward facts, he imposed upon everyone and why?"
"He had been partly, but
only partly, unintentionally the cause of a murder and when he knew that
he had given the murderers the opportunity, he sank into dejection, it
got on his mind and turned his brain, he began imagining things and he
persuaded himself that he was the murderer."
"But at last the High Court
of Appeal went into it and the poor fellow was acquitted and put under
proper care."
Thanks to the Court of Appeal!
Tut-tut-tut!
"Why, my dear
fellow, you may drive yourself into delirium if you have the impulse
to work upon your nerves, to go ringing bells at night and asking about
blood!"
I’ve studied all this morbid psychology in my practice.
"A man
is sometimes tempted to jump out of a window or from a belfry."
"Just the
same with bell-ringing.... It’s all illness, Rodion Romanovitch!"
"You
have begun to neglect your illness."
"You should consult an experienced
doctor, what’s the good of that fat fellow?"
You are lightheaded!
"You
were delirious when you did all this!”

For a moment Raskolnikov felt everything going round."
"“Is it possible, is it possible,” flashed through his mind, “that he is
still lying?"
"He can’t be, he can’t be.” He rejected that idea, feeling
to what a degree of fury it might drive him, feeling that that fury
might drive him mad."
“I was not delirious.
"I knew what I was doing,” he cried, straining
every faculty to penetrate Porfiry’s game, “I was quite myself, do you
hear?”

“Yes, I hear and understand."
"You said yesterday you were not delirious,
you were particularly emphatic about it!"
"I understand all you can tell
me!"
A-ach!...
"Listen, Rodion Romanovitch, my dear fellow."
"If you were
actually a criminal, or were somehow mixed up in this damnable business,
would you insist that you were not delirious but in full possession
of your faculties?"
And so emphatically and persistently?
"Would it be
possible?"
"Quite impossible, to my thinking."
"If you had anything on
your conscience, you certainly ought to insist that you were delirious."
"That’s so, isn’t it?”

There was a note of slyness in this inquiry."
"Raskolnikov drew back on
the sofa as Porfiry bent over him and stared in silent perplexity at
him."
"“Another thing about Razumihin--you certainly ought to have said that he
came of his own accord, to have concealed your part in it!"
"But you don’t
conceal it!"
"You lay stress on his coming at your instigation.”

Raskolnikov had not done so."
A chill went down his back.
"“You keep telling lies,” he said slowly and weakly, twisting his lips
into a sickly smile, “you are trying again to show that you know all
my game, that you know all I shall say beforehand,” he said, conscious
himself that he was not weighing his words as he ought."
"“You want to
frighten me... or you are simply laughing at me...”

He still stared at him as he said this and again there was a light of
intense hatred in his eyes."
"“You keep lying,” he said."
"“You know perfectly well that the best
policy for the criminal is to tell the truth as nearly as possible... to
conceal as little as possible."
"I don’t believe you!”

“What a wily person you are!” Porfiry tittered, “there’s no catching
you; you’ve a perfect monomania."
So you don’t believe me?
"But still you
do believe me, you believe a quarter; I’ll soon make you believe the
whole, because I have a sincere liking for you and genuinely wish you
good.”

Raskolnikov’s lips trembled."
"“Yes, I do,” went on Porfiry, touching Raskolnikov’s arm genially, “you
must take care of your illness."
"Besides, your mother and sister are here
now; you must think of them."
"You must soothe and comfort them and you do
nothing but frighten them...”

“What has that to do with you?"
How do you know it?
"What concern is it of
yours?"
"You are keeping watch on me and want to let me know it?”

“Good heavens!"
"Why, I learnt it all from you yourself!"
"You don’t
notice that in your excitement you tell me and others everything."
"From
Razumihin, too, I learnt a number of interesting details yesterday."
"No,
you interrupted me, but I must tell you that, for all your wit, your
suspiciousness makes you lose the common-sense view of things."
"To return
to bell-ringing, for instance."
"I, an examining lawyer, have betrayed a
precious thing like that, a real fact (for it is a fact worth having),
and you see nothing in it!"
"Why, if I had the slightest suspicion of you,
should I have acted like that?"
"No, I should first have disarmed your
suspicions and not let you see I knew of that fact, should have diverted
your attention and suddenly have dealt you a knock-down blow (your
expression) saying: ‘And what were you doing, sir, pray, at ten or
nearly eleven at the murdered woman’s flat and why did you ring the bell
and why did you ask about blood?"
"And why did you invite the porters
to go with you to the police station, to the lieutenant?’ That’s how
I ought to have acted if I had a grain of suspicion of you."
"I ought to
have taken your evidence in due form, searched your lodging and perhaps
have arrested you, too... so I have no suspicion of you, since I have
not done that!"
"But you can’t look at it normally and you see nothing, I
say again.”

Raskolnikov started so that Porfiry Petrovitch could not fail to
perceive it."
"“You are lying all the while,” he cried, “I don’t know your object,
but you are lying."
"You did not speak like that just now and I cannot be
mistaken!”

“I am lying?” Porfiry repeated, apparently incensed, but preserving
a good-humoured and ironical face, as though he were not in the least
concerned at Raskolnikov’s opinion of him."
"“I am lying... but how did
I treat you just now, I, the examining lawyer?"
"Prompting you and giving
you every means for your defence; illness, I said, delirium, injury,
melancholy and the police officers and all the rest of it?"
Ah!
He-he-he!
"Though, indeed, all those psychological means of defence are not very
reliable and cut both ways: illness, delirium, I don’t remember--that’s
all right, but why, my good sir, in your illness and in your delirium
were you haunted by just those delusions and not by any others?"
"There
may have been others, eh?"
"He-he-he!”

Raskolnikov looked haughtily and contemptuously at him."
"“Briefly,” he said loudly and imperiously, rising to his feet and in so
doing pushing Porfiry back a little, “briefly, I want to know, do you
acknowledge me perfectly free from suspicion or not?"
"Tell me, Porfiry
Petrovitch, tell me once for all and make haste!”

“What a business I’m having with you!” cried Porfiry with a perfectly
good-humoured, sly and composed face."
"“And why do you want to know, why
do you want to know so much, since they haven’t begun to worry you?"
"Why,
you are like a child asking for matches!"
And why are you so uneasy?
"Why
do you force yourself upon us, eh?"
"He-he-he!”

“I repeat,” Raskolnikov cried furiously, “that I can’t put up with it!”

“With what?"
Uncertainty?” interrupted Porfiry.
“Don’t jeer at me!
I won’t have it!
I tell you I won’t have it.
"I can’t
and I won’t, do you hear, do you hear?” he shouted, bringing his fist
down on the table again."
“Hush!
Hush!
They’ll overhear!
"I warn you seriously, take care of
yourself."
"I am not joking,” Porfiry whispered, but this time there was
not the look of old womanish good nature and alarm in his face."
"Now
he was peremptory, stern, frowning and for once laying aside all
mystification."
But this was only for an instant.
"Raskolnikov, bewildered, suddenly fell
into actual frenzy, but, strange to say, he again obeyed the command to
speak quietly, though he was in a perfect paroxysm of fury."
"“I will not allow myself to be tortured,” he whispered, instantly
recognising with hatred that he could not help obeying the command and
driven to even greater fury by the thought."
"“Arrest me, search me, but
kindly act in due form and don’t play with me!"
"Don’t dare!”

“Don’t worry about the form,” Porfiry interrupted with the same sly
smile, as it were, gloating with enjoyment over Raskolnikov."
"“I invited
you to see me quite in a friendly way.”

“I don’t want your friendship and I spit on it!"
Do you hear?
"And, here,
I take my cap and go."
"What will you say now if you mean to arrest me?”

He took up his cap and went to the door."
"“And won’t you see my little surprise?” chuckled Porfiry, again taking
him by the arm and stopping him at the door."
"He seemed to become more playful and good-humoured which maddened
Raskolnikov."
"“What surprise?” he asked, standing still and looking at Porfiry in
alarm."
"“My little surprise, it’s sitting there behind the door, he-he-he!”
 (He pointed to the locked door.)"
"“I locked him in that he should not
escape.”

“What is it?"
Where?
"What?...”

Raskolnikov walked to the door and would have opened it, but it was
locked."
"“It’s locked, here is the key!”

And he brought a key out of his pocket."
"“You are lying,” roared Raskolnikov without restraint, “you lie, you
damned punchinello!” and he rushed at Porfiry who retreated to the other
door, not at all alarmed."
“I understand it all!
"You are lying and mocking so that I may betray
myself to you...”

“Why, you could not betray yourself any further, my dear Rodion
Romanovitch."
You are in a passion.
"Don’t shout, I shall call the
clerks.”

“You are lying!"
Call the clerks!
"You knew I was ill and tried to work
me into a frenzy to make me betray myself, that was your object!"
"Produce
your facts!"
I understand it all.
"You’ve no evidence, you have only
wretched rubbishly suspicions like Zametov’s!"
"You knew my character, you
wanted to drive me to fury and then to knock me down with priests and
deputies.... Are you waiting for them?"
eh!
What are you waiting for?
Where are they?
"Produce them?”

“Why deputies, my good man?"
What things people will imagine!
"And to do
so would not be acting in form as you say, you don’t know the business,
my dear fellow.... And there’s no escaping form, as you see,” Porfiry
muttered, listening at the door through which a noise could be heard."
"“Ah, they’re coming,” cried Raskolnikov."
“You’ve sent for them!
"You
expected them!"
"Well, produce them all: your deputies, your witnesses,
what you like!..."
"I am ready!”

But at this moment a strange incident occurred, something so unexpected
that neither Raskolnikov nor Porfiry Petrovitch could have looked for
such a conclusion to their interview."
"CHAPTER VI

When he remembered the scene afterwards, this is how Raskolnikov saw it."
"The noise behind the door increased, and suddenly the door was opened a
little."
"“What is it?” cried Porfiry Petrovitch, annoyed."
"“Why, I gave orders...”

For an instant there was no answer, but it was evident that there were
several persons at the door, and that they were apparently pushing
somebody back."
"“What is it?” Porfiry Petrovitch repeated, uneasily."
"“The prisoner Nikolay has been brought,” someone answered."
“He is not wanted!
Take him away!
Let him wait!
What’s he doing here?
"How irregular!” cried Porfiry, rushing to the door."
"“But he...” began the same voice, and suddenly ceased."
"Two seconds, not more, were spent in actual struggle, then someone gave
a violent shove, and then a man, very pale, strode into the room."
This man’s appearance was at first sight very strange.
"He stared
straight before him, as though seeing nothing."
"There was a determined
gleam in his eyes; at the same time there was a deathly pallor in his
face, as though he were being led to the scaffold."
"His white lips were
faintly twitching."
"He was dressed like a workman and was of medium height, very young,
slim, his hair cut in round crop, with thin spare features."
"The man whom
he had thrust back followed him into the room and succeeded in seizing
him by the shoulder; he was a warder; but Nikolay pulled his arm away."
Several persons crowded inquisitively into the doorway.
"Some of them
tried to get in."
All this took place almost instantaneously.
"“Go away, it’s too soon!"
Wait till you are sent for!...
"Why have you
brought him so soon?” Porfiry Petrovitch muttered, extremely annoyed,
and as it were thrown out of his reckoning."
But Nikolay suddenly knelt down.
"“What’s the matter?” cried Porfiry, surprised."
“I am guilty!
Mine is the sin!
"I am the murderer,” Nikolay articulated
suddenly, rather breathless, but speaking fairly loudly."
"For ten seconds there was silence as though all had been struck dumb;
even the warder stepped back, mechanically retreated to the door, and
stood immovable."
"“What is it?” cried Porfiry Petrovitch, recovering from his momentary
stupefaction."
"“I... am the murderer,” repeated Nikolay, after a brief pause."
"“What... you... what... whom did you kill?” Porfiry Petrovitch was
obviously bewildered."
Nikolay again was silent for a moment.
"“Alyona Ivanovna and her sister Lizaveta Ivanovna, I... killed... with
an axe."
"Darkness came over me,” he added suddenly, and was again silent."
He still remained on his knees.
"Porfiry Petrovitch stood for some
moments as though meditating, but suddenly roused himself and waved back
the uninvited spectators."
They instantly vanished and closed the door.
"Then he looked towards Raskolnikov, who was standing in the corner,
staring wildly at Nikolay and moved towards him, but stopped short,
looked from Nikolay to Raskolnikov and then again at Nikolay, and
seeming unable to restrain himself darted at the latter."
"“You’re in too great a hurry,” he shouted at him, almost angrily."
"“I
didn’t ask you what came over you...."
"Speak, did you kill them?”

“I am the murderer...."
"I want to give evidence,” Nikolay pronounced."
“Ach!
"What did you kill them with?”

“An axe."
"I had it ready.”

“Ach, he is in a hurry!"
"Alone?”

Nikolay did not understand the question."
"“Did you do it alone?”

“Yes, alone."
"And Mitka is not guilty and had no share in it.”

“Don’t be in a hurry about Mitka!"
A-ach!
"How was it you ran downstairs
like that at the time?"
"The porters met you both!”

“It was to put them off the scent..."
"I ran after Mitka,” Nikolay replied
hurriedly, as though he had prepared the answer."
"“I knew it!” cried Porfiry, with vexation."
"“It’s not his own tale he is
telling,” he muttered as though to himself, and suddenly his eyes rested
on Raskolnikov again."
"He was apparently so taken up with Nikolay that for a moment he had
forgotten Raskolnikov."
He was a little taken aback.
"“My dear Rodion Romanovitch, excuse me!” he flew up to him, “this won’t
do; I’m afraid you must go... it’s no good your staying..."
"I will...
you see, what a surprise!..."
"Good-bye!”

And taking him by the arm, he showed him to the door."
"“I suppose you didn’t expect it?” said Raskolnikov who, though he had
not yet fully grasped the situation, had regained his courage."
"“You did not expect it either, my friend."
"See how your hand is
trembling!"
"He-he!”

“You’re trembling, too, Porfiry Petrovitch!”

“Yes, I am; I didn’t expect it.”

They were already at the door; Porfiry was impatient for Raskolnikov to
be gone."
"“And your little surprise, aren’t you going to show it to me?”
 Raskolnikov said, sarcastically."
"“Why, his teeth are chattering as he asks, he-he!"
"You are an ironical
person!"
"Come, till we meet!”

“I believe we can say _good-bye_!”

“That’s in God’s hands,” muttered Porfiry, with an unnatural smile."
"As he walked through the office, Raskolnikov noticed that many people
were looking at him."
"Among them he saw the two porters from _the_ house,
whom he had invited that night to the police station."
"They stood there
waiting."
"But he was no sooner on the stairs than he heard the voice of
Porfiry Petrovitch behind him."
"Turning round, he saw the latter running
after him, out of breath."
"“One word, Rodion Romanovitch; as to all the rest, it’s in God’s hands,
but as a matter of form there are some questions I shall have to ask
you... so we shall meet again, shan’t we?”

And Porfiry stood still, facing him with a smile."
“Shan’t we?” he added again.
"He seemed to want to say something more, but could not speak out."
"“You must forgive me, Porfiry Petrovitch, for what has just passed..."
"I
lost my temper,” began Raskolnikov, who had so far regained his courage
that he felt irresistibly inclined to display his coolness."
"“Don’t mention it, don’t mention it,” Porfiry replied, almost gleefully."
"“I myself, too..."
"I have a wicked temper, I admit it!"
"But we shall meet
again."
"If it’s God’s will, we may see a great deal of one another.”

“And will get to know each other through and through?” added
Raskolnikov."
"“Yes; know each other through and through,” assented Porfiry Petrovitch,
and he screwed up his eyes, looking earnestly at Raskolnikov."
"“Now
you’re going to a birthday party?”

“To a funeral.”

“Of course, the funeral!"
"Take care of yourself, and get well.”

“I don’t know what to wish you,” said Raskolnikov, who had begun to
descend the stairs, but looked back again."
"“I should like to wish you
success, but your office is such a comical one.”

“Why comical?” Porfiry Petrovitch had turned to go, but he seemed to
prick up his ears at this."
"“Why, how you must have been torturing and harassing that poor Nikolay
psychologically, after your fashion, till he confessed!"
"You must have
been at him day and night, proving to him that he was the murderer, and
now that he has confessed, you’ll begin vivisecting him again."
"‘You are
lying,’ you’ll say."
‘You are not the murderer!
You can’t be!
"It’s not
your own tale you are telling!’ You must admit it’s a comical business!”

“He-he-he!"
"You noticed then that I said to Nikolay just now that it was
not his own tale he was telling?”

“How could I help noticing it!”

“He-he!"
You are quick-witted.
You notice everything!
"You’ve really a
playful mind!"
And you always fasten on the comic side... he-he!
"They say
that was the marked characteristic of Gogol, among the writers.”

“Yes, of Gogol.”

“Yes, of Gogol...."
"I shall look forward to meeting you.”

“So shall I.”

Raskolnikov walked straight home."
"He was so muddled and bewildered that
on getting home he sat for a quarter of an hour on the sofa, trying to
collect his thoughts."
"He did not attempt to think about Nikolay; he
was stupefied; he felt that his confession was something inexplicable,
amazing--something beyond his understanding."
"But Nikolay’s confession
was an actual fact."
"The consequences of this fact were clear to him at
once, its falsehood could not fail to be discovered, and then they
would be after him again."
"Till then, at least, he was free and must do
something for himself, for the danger was imminent."
But how imminent?
His position gradually became clear to him.
"Remembering, sketchily, the main outlines of his recent scene with
Porfiry, he could not help shuddering again with horror."
"Of course,
he did not yet know all Porfiry’s aims, he could not see into all his
calculations."
"But he had already partly shown his hand, and no one knew
better than Raskolnikov how terrible Porfiry’s “lead” had been for
him."
"A little more and he _might_ have given himself away completely,
circumstantially."
"Knowing his nervous temperament and from the first
glance seeing through him, Porfiry, though playing a bold game, was
bound to win."
"There’s no denying that Raskolnikov had compromised
himself seriously, but no _facts_ had come to light as yet; there was
nothing positive."
But was he taking a true view of the position?
"Wasn’t
he mistaken?"
What had Porfiry been trying to get at?
"Had he really some
surprise prepared for him?"
And what was it?
"Had he really been expecting
something or not?"
"How would they have parted if it had not been for the
unexpected appearance of Nikolay?"
"Porfiry had shown almost all his cards--of course, he had risked
something in showing them--and if he had really had anything up his
sleeve (Raskolnikov reflected), he would have shown that, too."
"What was
that “surprise”?"
Was it a joke?
Had it meant anything?
"Could it have
concealed anything like a fact, a piece of positive evidence?"
"His
yesterday’s visitor?"
What had become of him?
Where was he to-day?
"If
Porfiry really had any evidence, it must be connected with him...."
"He sat on the sofa with his elbows on his knees and his face hidden in
his hands."
He was still shivering nervously.
"At last he got up, took his
cap, thought a minute, and went to the door."
"He had a sort of presentiment that for to-day, at least, he might
consider himself out of danger."
"He had a sudden sense almost of joy; he
wanted to make haste to Katerina Ivanovna’s."
"He would be too late for
the funeral, of course, but he would be in time for the memorial dinner,
and there at once he would see Sonia."
"He stood still, thought a moment, and a suffering smile came for a
moment on to his lips."
“To-day!
"To-day,” he repeated to himself."
"“Yes, to-day!"
"So it must
be....”

But as he was about to open the door, it began opening of itself."
"He
started and moved back."
"The door opened gently and slowly, and there
suddenly appeared a figure--yesterday’s visitor _from underground_."
"The man stood in the doorway, looked at Raskolnikov without speaking,
and took a step forward into the room."
"He was exactly the same as
yesterday; the same figure, the same dress, but there was a great change
in his face; he looked dejected and sighed deeply."
"If he had only put
his hand up to his cheek and leaned his head on one side he would have
looked exactly like a peasant woman."
"“What do you want?” asked Raskolnikov, numb with terror."
"The man was
still silent, but suddenly he bowed down almost to the ground, touching
it with his finger."
“What is it?” cried Raskolnikov.
"“I have sinned,” the man articulated softly."
"“How?”

“By evil thoughts.”

They looked at one another."
“I was vexed.
"When you came, perhaps in drink, and bade the porters go
to the police station and asked about the blood, I was vexed that they
let you go and took you for drunken."
"I was so vexed that I lost my
sleep."
"And remembering the address we came here yesterday and asked for
you....”

“Who came?” Raskolnikov interrupted, instantly beginning to recollect."
"“I did, I’ve wronged you.”

“Then you come from that house?”

“I was standing at the gate with them... don’t you remember?"
"We have
carried on our trade in that house for years past."
"We cure and prepare
hides, we take work home... most of all I was vexed....”

And the whole scene of the day before yesterday in the gateway came
clearly before Raskolnikov’s mind; he recollected that there had
been several people there besides the porters, women among them."
"He remembered one voice had suggested taking him straight to the
police-station."
"He could not recall the face of the speaker, and even
now he did not recognise it, but he remembered that he had turned round
and made him some answer...."
So this was the solution of yesterday’s horror.
"The most awful thought
was that he had been actually almost lost, had almost done for himself
on account of such a _trivial_ circumstance."
"So this man could tell
nothing except his asking about the flat and the blood stains."
"So
Porfiry, too, had nothing but that _delirium_, no facts but this
_psychology_ which _cuts both ways_, nothing positive."
"So if no more
facts come to light (and they must not, they must not!)"
"then... then
what can they do to him?"
"How can they convict him, even if they arrest
him?"
"And Porfiry then had only just heard about the flat and had not
known about it before."
"“Was it you who told Porfiry... that I’d been there?” he cried, struck
by a sudden idea."
"“What Porfiry?”

“The head of the detective department?”

“Yes."
"The porters did not go there, but I went.”

“To-day?”

“I got there two minutes before you."
"And I heard, I heard it all, how he
worried you.”

“Where?"
What?
"When?”

“Why, in the next room."
"I was sitting there all the time.”

“What?"
"Why, then you were the surprise?"
But how could it happen?
"Upon my
word!”

“I saw that the porters did not want to do what I said,” began the man;
“for it’s too late, said they, and maybe he’ll be angry that we did not
come at the time."
"I was vexed and I lost my sleep, and I began making
inquiries."
"And finding out yesterday where to go, I went to-day."
"The
first time I went he wasn’t there, when I came an hour later he couldn’t
see me."
"I went the third time, and they showed me in."
"I informed him of
everything, just as it happened, and he began skipping about the room
and punching himself on the chest."
‘What do you scoundrels mean by it?
"If I’d known about it I should have arrested him!’ Then he ran out,
called somebody and began talking to him in the corner, then he turned
to me, scolding and questioning me."
"He scolded me a great deal; and I
told him everything, and I told him that you didn’t dare to say a word
in answer to me yesterday and that you didn’t recognise me."
"And he
fell to running about again and kept hitting himself on the chest, and
getting angry and running about, and when you were announced he told
me to go into the next room."
"‘Sit there a bit,’ he said."
"‘Don’t move,
whatever you may hear.’ And he set a chair there for me and locked
me in."
"‘Perhaps,’ he said, ‘I may call you.’ And when Nikolay’d been
brought he let me out as soon as you were gone."
"‘I shall send for you
again and question you,’ he said.”

“And did he question Nikolay while you were there?”

“He got rid of me as he did of you, before he spoke to Nikolay.”

The man stood still, and again suddenly bowed down, touching the ground
with his finger."
"“Forgive me for my evil thoughts, and my slander.”

“May God forgive you,” answered Raskolnikov."
"And as he said this, the man bowed down again, but not to the ground,
turned slowly and went out of the room."
"“It all cuts both ways, now it all cuts both ways,” repeated
Raskolnikov, and he went out more confident than ever."
"“Now we’ll make a fight for it,” he said, with a malicious smile, as he
went down the stairs."
"His malice was aimed at himself; with shame and
contempt he recollected his “cowardice.”




PART V



CHAPTER I

The morning that followed the fateful interview with Dounia and
her mother brought sobering influences to bear on Pyotr Petrovitch."
"Intensely unpleasant as it was, he was forced little by little to accept
as a fact beyond recall what had seemed to him only the day before
fantastic and incredible."
"The black snake of wounded vanity had been
gnawing at his heart all night."
"When he got out of bed, Pyotr Petrovitch
immediately looked in the looking-glass."
"He was afraid that he had
jaundice."
"However his health seemed unimpaired so far, and looking at
his noble, clear-skinned countenance which had grown fattish of
late, Pyotr Petrovitch for an instant was positively comforted in the
conviction that he would find another bride and, perhaps, even a better
one."
"But coming back to the sense of his present position, he turned
aside and spat vigorously, which excited a sarcastic smile in Andrey
Semyonovitch Lebeziatnikov, the young friend with whom he was staying."
"That smile Pyotr Petrovitch noticed, and at once set it down against his
young friend’s account."
"He had set down a good many points against him
of late."
"His anger was redoubled when he reflected that he ought not to
have told Andrey Semyonovitch about the result of yesterday’s interview."
"That was the second mistake he had made in temper, through impulsiveness
and irritability...."
"Moreover, all that morning one unpleasantness
followed another."
"He even found a hitch awaiting him in his legal case
in the senate."
"He was particularly irritated by the owner of the flat
which had been taken in view of his approaching marriage and was being
redecorated at his own expense; the owner, a rich German tradesman,
would not entertain the idea of breaking the contract which had just
been signed and insisted on the full forfeit money, though Pyotr
Petrovitch would be giving him back the flat practically redecorated."
"In
the same way the upholsterers refused to return a single rouble of the
instalment paid for the furniture purchased but not yet removed to the
flat."
"“Am I to get married simply for the sake of the furniture?” Pyotr
Petrovitch ground his teeth and at the same time once more he had a
gleam of desperate hope."
“Can all that be really so irrevocably over?
"Is it no use to make another effort?” The thought of Dounia sent a
voluptuous pang through his heart."
"He endured anguish at that moment,
and if it had been possible to slay Raskolnikov instantly by wishing it,
Pyotr Petrovitch would promptly have uttered the wish."
"“It was my mistake, too, not to have given them money,” he thought, as
he returned dejectedly to Lebeziatnikov’s room, “and why on earth was I
such a Jew?"
It was false economy!
"I meant to keep them without a penny
so that they should turn to me as their providence, and look at them!"
foo!
"If I’d spent some fifteen hundred roubles on them for the trousseau
and presents, on knick-knacks, dressing-cases, jewellery, materials, and
all that sort of trash from Knopp’s and the English shop, my position
would have been better and... stronger!"
"They could not have refused me
so easily!"
"They are the sort of people that would feel bound to return
money and presents if they broke it off; and they would find it hard to
do it!"
"And their conscience would prick them: how can we dismiss a man
who has hitherto been so generous and delicate?...."
H’m!
"I’ve made a
blunder.”

And grinding his teeth again, Pyotr Petrovitch called himself a
fool--but not aloud, of course."
"He returned home, twice as irritated and angry as before."
"The
preparations for the funeral dinner at Katerina Ivanovna’s excited
his curiosity as he passed."
"He had heard about it the day before; he
fancied, indeed, that he had been invited, but absorbed in his own cares
he had paid no attention."
"Inquiring of Madame Lippevechsel who was busy
laying the table while Katerina Ivanovna was away at the cemetery, he
heard that the entertainment was to be a great affair, that all the
lodgers had been invited, among them some who had not known the dead
man, that even Andrey Semyonovitch Lebeziatnikov was invited in spite of
his previous quarrel with Katerina Ivanovna, that he, Pyotr Petrovitch,
was not only invited, but was eagerly expected as he was the most
important of the lodgers."
"Amalia Ivanovna herself had been invited with
great ceremony in spite of the recent unpleasantness, and so she was
very busy with preparations and was taking a positive pleasure in them;
she was moreover dressed up to the nines, all in new black silk, and she
was proud of it."
"All this suggested an idea to Pyotr Petrovitch and he
went into his room, or rather Lebeziatnikov’s, somewhat thoughtful."
"He
had learnt that Raskolnikov was to be one of the guests."
Andrey Semyonovitch had been at home all the morning.
"The attitude of
Pyotr Petrovitch to this gentleman was strange, though perhaps natural."
"Pyotr Petrovitch had despised and hated him from the day he came to stay
with him and at the same time he seemed somewhat afraid of him."
"He
had not come to stay with him on his arrival in Petersburg simply from
parsimony, though that had been perhaps his chief object."
"He had heard
of Andrey Semyonovitch, who had once been his ward, as a leading young
progressive who was taking an important part in certain interesting
circles, the doings of which were a legend in the provinces."
"It had
impressed Pyotr Petrovitch."
"These powerful omniscient circles who
despised everyone and showed everyone up had long inspired in him a
peculiar but quite vague alarm."
"He had not, of course, been able to form
even an approximate notion of what they meant."
"He, like everyone, had
heard that there were, especially in Petersburg, progressives of some
sort, nihilists and so on, and, like many people, he exaggerated and
distorted the significance of those words to an absurd degree."
"What for
many years past he had feared more than anything was _being shown
up_ and this was the chief ground for his continual uneasiness at the
thought of transferring his business to Petersburg."
"He was afraid of
this as little children are sometimes panic-stricken."
"Some years before,
when he was just entering on his own career, he had come upon two cases
in which rather important personages in the province, patrons of his,
had been cruelly shown up."
"One instance had ended in great scandal
for the person attacked and the other had very nearly ended in serious
trouble."
"For this reason Pyotr Petrovitch intended to go into the
subject as soon as he reached Petersburg and, if necessary, to
anticipate contingencies by seeking the favour of “our younger
generation.” He relied on Andrey Semyonovitch for this and before
his visit to Raskolnikov he had succeeded in picking up some current
phrases."
"He soon discovered that Andrey Semyonovitch was a commonplace
simpleton, but that by no means reassured Pyotr Petrovitch."
"Even if he
had been certain that all the progressives were fools like him, it
would not have allayed his uneasiness."
"All the doctrines, the ideas, the
systems, with which Andrey Semyonovitch pestered him had no interest for
him."
"He had his own object--he simply wanted to find out at once what
was happening _here_."
Had these people any power or not?
"Had he anything
to fear from them?"
Would they expose any enterprise of his?
"And what
precisely was now the object of their attacks?"
"Could he somehow make up
to them and get round them if they really were powerful?"
"Was this the
thing to do or not?"
Couldn’t he gain something through them?
"In fact
hundreds of questions presented themselves."
"Andrey Semyonovitch was an anæmic, scrofulous little man, with strangely
flaxen mutton-chop whiskers of which he was very proud."
"He was a clerk
and had almost always something wrong with his eyes."
"He was rather
soft-hearted, but self-confident and sometimes extremely conceited in
speech, which had an absurd effect, incongruous with his little figure."
"He was one of the lodgers most respected by Amalia Ivanovna, for he did
not get drunk and paid regularly for his lodgings."
"Andrey Semyonovitch
really was rather stupid; he attached himself to the cause of progress
and “our younger generation” from enthusiasm."
"He was one of the numerous
and varied legion of dullards, of half-animate abortions, conceited,
half-educated coxcombs, who attach themselves to the idea most in
fashion only to vulgarise it and who caricature every cause they serve,
however sincerely."
"Though Lebeziatnikov was so good-natured, he, too, was beginning to
dislike Pyotr Petrovitch."
This happened on both sides unconsciously.
"However simple Andrey Semyonovitch might be, he began to see that Pyotr
Petrovitch was duping him and secretly despising him, and that “he was
not the right sort of man.” He had tried expounding to him the system of
Fourier and the Darwinian theory, but of late Pyotr Petrovitch began to
listen too sarcastically and even to be rude."
"The fact was he had begun
instinctively to guess that Lebeziatnikov was not merely a commonplace
simpleton, but, perhaps, a liar, too, and that he had no connections of
any consequence even in his own circle, but had simply picked things up
third-hand; and that very likely he did not even know much about his own
work of propaganda, for he was in too great a muddle."
"A fine person he
would be to show anyone up!"
"It must be noted, by the way, that Pyotr
Petrovitch had during those ten days eagerly accepted the strangest
praise from Andrey Semyonovitch; he had not protested, for instance,
when Andrey Semyonovitch belauded him for being ready to contribute to
the establishment of the new “commune,” or to abstain from christening
his future children, or to acquiesce if Dounia were to take a lover a
month after marriage, and so on."
"Pyotr Petrovitch so enjoyed hearing
his own praises that he did not disdain even such virtues when they were
attributed to him."
"Pyotr Petrovitch had had occasion that morning to realise some
five-per-cent bonds and now he sat down to the table and counted over
bundles of notes."
"Andrey Semyonovitch who hardly ever had any money
walked about the room pretending to himself to look at all those bank
notes with indifference and even contempt."
"Nothing would have convinced
Pyotr Petrovitch that Andrey Semyonovitch could really look on the money
unmoved, and the latter, on his side, kept thinking bitterly that Pyotr
Petrovitch was capable of entertaining such an idea about him and
was, perhaps, glad of the opportunity of teasing his young friend by
reminding him of his inferiority and the great difference between them."
"He found him incredibly inattentive and irritable, though he, Andrey
Semyonovitch, began enlarging on his favourite subject, the foundation
of a new special “commune.” The brief remarks that dropped from Pyotr
Petrovitch between the clicking of the beads on the reckoning frame
betrayed unmistakable and discourteous irony."
"But the “humane” Andrey
Semyonovitch ascribed Pyotr Petrovitch’s ill-humour to his recent breach
with Dounia and he was burning with impatience to discourse on that
theme."
"He had something progressive to say on the subject which
might console his worthy friend and “could not fail” to promote his
development."
"“There is some sort of festivity being prepared at that... at the
widow’s, isn’t there?” Pyotr Petrovitch asked suddenly, interrupting
Andrey Semyonovitch at the most interesting passage."
"“Why, don’t you know?"
"Why, I was telling you last night what I think
about all such ceremonies."
"And she invited you too, I heard."
"You were
talking to her yesterday...”

“I should never have expected that beggarly fool would have spent on
this feast all the money she got from that other fool, Raskolnikov."
"I
was surprised just now as I came through at the preparations there, the
wines!"
Several people are invited.
"It’s beyond everything!” continued
Pyotr Petrovitch, who seemed to have some object in pursuing the
conversation."
“What?
You say I am asked too?
When was that?
"I don’t
remember."
But I shan’t go.
Why should I?
"I only said a word to her in
passing yesterday of the possibility of her obtaining a year’s salary as
a destitute widow of a government clerk."
"I suppose she has invited me on
that account, hasn’t she?"
"He-he-he!”

“I don’t intend to go either,” said Lebeziatnikov."
"“I should think not, after giving her a thrashing!"
"You might well
hesitate, he-he!”

“Who thrashed?"
"Whom?” cried Lebeziatnikov, flustered and blushing."
"“Why, you thrashed Katerina Ivanovna a month ago."
"I heard so
yesterday... so that’s what your convictions amount to... and the woman
question, too, wasn’t quite sound, he-he-he!” and Pyotr Petrovitch, as
though comforted, went back to clicking his beads."
"“It’s all slander and nonsense!” cried Lebeziatnikov, who was always
afraid of allusions to the subject."
"“It was not like that at all, it
was quite different."
You’ve heard it wrong; it’s a libel.
"I was simply
defending myself."
"She rushed at me first with her nails, she pulled
out all my whiskers.... It’s permissable for anyone, I should hope,
to defend himself and I never allow anyone to use violence to me on
principle, for it’s an act of despotism."
What was I to do?
"I simply
pushed her back.”

“He-he-he!” Luzhin went on laughing maliciously."
“You keep on like that because you are out of humour yourself....
"But
that’s nonsense and it has nothing, nothing whatever to do with the
woman question!"
"You don’t understand; I used to think, indeed, that
if women are equal to men in all respects, even in strength (as is
maintained now) there ought to be equality in that, too."
"Of course, I
reflected afterwards that such a question ought not really to arise,
for there ought not to be fighting and in the future society fighting is
unthinkable... and that it would be a queer thing to seek for equality
in fighting."
"I am not so stupid... though, of course, there is
fighting... there won’t be later, but at present there is... confound
it!"
How muddled one gets with you!
"It’s not on that account that I
am not going."
"I am not going on principle, not to take part in the
revolting convention of memorial dinners, that’s why!"
"Though, of course,
one might go to laugh at it...."
"I am sorry there won’t be any priests at
it."
"I should certainly go if there were.”

“Then you would sit down at another man’s table and insult it and those
who invited you."
"Eh?”

“Certainly not insult, but protest."
I should do it with a good object.
"I
might indirectly assist the cause of enlightenment and propaganda."
"It’s
a duty of every man to work for enlightenment and propaganda and the
more harshly, perhaps, the better."
"I might drop a seed, an idea.... And
something might grow up from that seed."
How should I be insulting them?
"They might be offended at first, but afterwards they’d see I’d done them
a service."
"You know, Terebyeva (who is in the community now) was blamed
because when she left her family and... devoted... herself, she wrote to
her father and mother that she wouldn’t go on living conventionally and
was entering on a free marriage and it was said that that was too harsh,
that she might have spared them and have written more kindly."
"I think
that’s all nonsense and there’s no need of softness; on the contrary,
what’s wanted is protest."
"Varents had been married seven years, she
abandoned her two children, she told her husband straight out in a
letter: ‘I have realised that I cannot be happy with you."
"I can never
forgive you that you have deceived me by concealing from me that there
is another organisation of society by means of the communities."
"I have
only lately learned it from a great-hearted man to whom I have given
myself and with whom I am establishing a community."
"I speak plainly
because I consider it dishonest to deceive you."
Do as you think best.
"Do not hope to get me back, you are too late."
"I hope you will be happy.’
That’s how letters like that ought to be written!”

“Is that Terebyeva the one you said had made a third free marriage?”

“No, it’s only the second, really!"
"But what if it were the fourth, what
if it were the fifteenth, that’s all nonsense!"
"And if ever I regretted
the death of my father and mother, it is now, and I sometimes think
if my parents were living what a protest I would have aimed at them!"
"I
would have done something on purpose..."
I would have shown them!
"I would
have astonished them!"
"I am really sorry there is no one!”

“To surprise!"
He-he!
"Well, be that as you will,” Pyotr Petrovitch
interrupted, “but tell me this; do you know the dead man’s daughter, the
delicate-looking little thing?"
"It’s true what they say about her, isn’t
it?”

“What of it?"
"I think, that is, it is my own personal conviction that
this is the normal condition of women."
Why not?
"I mean, _distinguons_."
"In our present society it is not altogether normal, because it is
compulsory, but in the future society it will be perfectly normal,
because it will be voluntary."
"Even as it is, she was quite right: she
was suffering and that was her asset, so to speak, her capital which
she had a perfect right to dispose of."
"Of course, in the future
society there will be no need of assets, but her part will have another
significance, rational and in harmony with her environment."
"As to Sofya
Semyonovna personally, I regard her action as a vigorous protest against
the organisation of society, and I respect her deeply for it; I rejoice
indeed when I look at her!”

“I was told that you got her turned out of these lodgings.”

Lebeziatnikov was enraged."
"“That’s another slander,” he yelled."
“It was not so at all!
"That was all
Katerina Ivanovna’s invention, for she did not understand!"
"And I never
made love to Sofya Semyonovna!"
"I was simply developing her, entirely
disinterestedly, trying to rouse her to protest.... All I wanted was her
protest and Sofya Semyonovna could not have remained here anyway!”

“Have you asked her to join your community?”

“You keep on laughing and very inappropriately, allow me to tell
you."
You don’t understand!
There is no such rôle in a community.
"The
community is established that there should be no such rôles."
"In a
community, such a rôle is essentially transformed and what is stupid
here is sensible there, what, under present conditions, is unnatural
becomes perfectly natural in the community."
"It all depends on the
environment."
It’s all the environment and man himself is nothing.
"And
I am on good terms with Sofya Semyonovna to this day, which is a proof
that she never regarded me as having wronged her."
"I am trying now to
attract her to the community, but on quite, quite a different footing."
What are you laughing at?
"We are trying to establish a community of
our own, a special one, on a broader basis."
"We have gone further in our
convictions."
We reject more!
"And meanwhile I’m still developing Sofya
Semyonovna."
"She has a beautiful, beautiful character!”

“And you take advantage of her fine character, eh?"
"He-he!”

“No, no!"
"Oh, no!"
"On the contrary.”

“Oh, on the contrary!"
He-he-he!
"A queer thing to say!”

“Believe me!"
Why should I disguise it?
"In fact, I feel it strange myself
how timid, chaste and modern she is with me!”

“And you, of course, are developing her... he-he!"
"trying to prove to her
that all that modesty is nonsense?”

“Not at all, not at all!"
"How coarsely, how stupidly--excuse me saying
so--you misunderstand the word development!"
"Good heavens, how... crude
you still are!"
"We are striving for the freedom of women and you have
only one idea in your head...."
"Setting aside the general question
of chastity and feminine modesty as useless in themselves and indeed
prejudices, I fully accept her chastity with me, because that’s for her
to decide."
"Of course if she were to tell me herself that she wanted me,
I should think myself very lucky, because I like the girl very much; but
as it is, no one has ever treated her more courteously than I, with more
respect for her dignity..."
"I wait in hopes, that’s all!”

“You had much better make her a present of something."
"I bet you never
thought of that.”

“You don’t understand, as I’ve told you already!"
"Of course, she is in
such a position, but it’s another question."
Quite another question!
You simply despise her.
"Seeing a fact which you mistakenly consider
deserving of contempt, you refuse to take a humane view of a fellow
creature."
You don’t know what a character she is!
"I am only sorry that
of late she has quite given up reading and borrowing books."
"I used
to lend them to her."
"I am sorry, too, that with all the energy and
resolution in protesting--which she has already shown once--she has
little self-reliance, little, so to say, independence, so as to
break free from certain prejudices and certain foolish ideas."
"Yet she
thoroughly understands some questions, for instance about kissing of
hands, that is, that it’s an insult to a woman for a man to kiss her
hand, because it’s a sign of inequality."
"We had a debate about it and
I described it to her."
"She listened attentively to an account of the
workmen’s associations in France, too."
"Now I am explaining the question
of coming into the room in the future society.”

“And what’s that, pray?”

“We had a debate lately on the question: Has a member of the community
the right to enter another member’s room, whether man or woman, at any
time... and we decided that he has!”

“It might be at an inconvenient moment, he-he!”

Lebeziatnikov was really angry."
"“You are always thinking of something unpleasant,” he cried with
aversion."
“Tfoo!
"How vexed I am that when I was expounding our system, I
referred prematurely to the question of personal privacy!"
"It’s always
a stumbling-block to people like you, they turn it into ridicule before
they understand it."
"And how proud they are of it, too!"
Tfoo!
"I’ve often
maintained that that question should not be approached by a novice till
he has a firm faith in the system."
"And tell me, please, what do you
find so shameful even in cesspools?"
"I should be the first to be ready
to clean out any cesspool you like."
"And it’s not a question of
self-sacrifice, it’s simply work, honourable, useful work which is
as good as any other and much better than the work of a Raphael and a
Pushkin, because it is more useful.”

“And more honourable, more honourable, he-he-he!”

“What do you mean by ‘more honourable’?"
"I don’t understand such
expressions to describe human activity."
"‘More honourable,’ ‘nobler’--all
those are old-fashioned prejudices which I reject."
"Everything which is
_of use_ to mankind is honourable."
I only understand one word: _useful_!
"You can snigger as much as you like, but that’s so!”

Pyotr Petrovitch laughed heartily."
"He had finished counting the money
and was putting it away."
But some of the notes he left on the table.
"The
“cesspool question” had already been a subject of dispute between them."
"What was absurd was that it made Lebeziatnikov really angry, while it
amused Luzhin and at that moment he particularly wanted to anger his
young friend."
"“It’s your ill-luck yesterday that makes you so ill-humoured and
annoying,” blurted out Lebeziatnikov, who in spite of his “independence”
 and his “protests” did not venture to oppose Pyotr Petrovitch and still
behaved to him with some of the respect habitual in earlier years."
"“You’d better tell me this,” Pyotr Petrovitch interrupted with haughty
displeasure, “can you... or rather are you really friendly enough with
that young person to ask her to step in here for a minute?"
"I think
they’ve all come back from the cemetery..."
"I heard the sound of
steps..."
"I want to see her, that young person.”

“What for?” Lebeziatnikov asked with surprise."
"“Oh, I want to."
"I am leaving here to-day or to-morrow and therefore I
wanted to speak to her about..."
"However, you may be present during the
interview."
"It’s better you should be, indeed."
"For there’s no knowing
what you might imagine.”

“I shan’t imagine anything."
"I only asked and, if you’ve anything to say
to her, nothing is easier than to call her in."
"I’ll go directly and you
may be sure I won’t be in your way.”

Five minutes later Lebeziatnikov came in with Sonia."
"She came in very
much surprised and overcome with shyness as usual."
"She was always shy in
such circumstances and was always afraid of new people, she had been as
a child and was even more so now.... Pyotr Petrovitch met her “politely
and affably,” but with a certain shade of bantering familiarity which in
his opinion was suitable for a man of his respectability and weight
in dealing with a creature so young and so _interesting_ as she."
"He
hastened to “reassure” her and made her sit down facing him at the
table."
"Sonia sat down, looked about her--at Lebeziatnikov, at the notes
lying on the table and then again at Pyotr Petrovitch and her eyes
remained riveted on him."
Lebeziatnikov was moving to the door.
"Pyotr
Petrovitch signed to Sonia to remain seated and stopped Lebeziatnikov."
“Is Raskolnikov in there?
Has he come?” he asked him in a whisper.
“Raskolnikov?
Yes.
Why?
"Yes, he is there."
"I saw him just come in....
Why?”

“Well, I particularly beg you to remain here with us and not to leave
me alone with this... young woman."
"I only want a few words with her,
but God knows what they may make of it."
"I shouldn’t like Raskolnikov to
repeat anything.... You understand what I mean?”

“I understand!” Lebeziatnikov saw the point."
"“Yes, you are right.... Of
course, I am convinced personally that you have no reason to be uneasy,
but... still, you are right."
Certainly I’ll stay.
"I’ll stand here at the
window and not be in your way..."
"I think you are right...”

Pyotr Petrovitch returned to the sofa, sat down opposite Sonia, looked
attentively at her and assumed an extremely dignified, even severe
expression, as much as to say, “don’t you make any mistake, madam.”
 Sonia was overwhelmed with embarrassment."
"“In the first place, Sofya Semyonovna, will you make my excuses to your
respected mamma.... That’s right, isn’t it?"
"Katerina Ivanovna stands
in the place of a mother to you?” Pyotr Petrovitch began with great
dignity, though affably."
It was evident that his intentions were friendly.
"“Quite so, yes; the place of a mother,” Sonia answered, timidly and
hurriedly."
“Then will you make my apologies to her?
"Through inevitable
circumstances I am forced to be absent and shall not be at the dinner in
spite of your mamma’s kind invitation.”

“Yes... I’ll tell her... at once.”

And Sonia hastily jumped up from her seat."
"“Wait, that’s not all,” Pyotr Petrovitch detained her, smiling at her
simplicity and ignorance of good manners, “and you know me little, my
dear Sofya Semyonovna, if you suppose I would have ventured to trouble
a person like you for a matter of so little consequence affecting myself
only."
"I have another object.”

Sonia sat down hurriedly."
"Her eyes rested again for an instant on the
grey-and-rainbow-coloured notes that remained on the table, but she
quickly looked away and fixed her eyes on Pyotr Petrovitch."
"She felt it
horribly indecorous, especially for _her_, to look at another person’s
money."
"She stared at the gold eye-glass which Pyotr Petrovitch held
in his left hand and at the massive and extremely handsome ring with a
yellow stone on his middle finger."
"But suddenly she looked away and, not
knowing where to turn, ended by staring Pyotr Petrovitch again straight
in the face."
After a pause of still greater dignity he continued.
"“I chanced yesterday in passing to exchange a couple of words with
Katerina Ivanovna, poor woman."
"That was sufficient to enable me to
ascertain that she is in a position--preternatural, if one may so
express it.”

“Yes... preternatural...” Sonia hurriedly assented."
"“Or it would be simpler and more comprehensible to say, ill.”

“Yes, simpler and more comprehen... yes, ill.”

“Quite so."
"So then from a feeling of humanity and so to speak
compassion, I should be glad to be of service to her in any way,
foreseeing her unfortunate position."
"I believe the whole of this
poverty-stricken family depends now entirely on you?”

“Allow me to ask,” Sonia rose to her feet, “did you say something to her
yesterday of the possibility of a pension?"
"Because she told me you had
undertaken to get her one."
"Was that true?”

“Not in the slightest, and indeed it’s an absurdity!"
"I merely hinted at
her obtaining temporary assistance as the widow of an official who had
died in the service--if only she has patronage... but apparently your
late parent had not served his full term and had not indeed been in the
service at all of late."
"In fact, if there could be any hope, it would be
very ephemeral, because there would be no claim for assistance in
that case, far from it.... And she is dreaming of a pension already,
he-he-he!..."
"A go-ahead lady!”

“Yes, she is."
"For she is credulous and good-hearted, and she believes
everything from the goodness of her heart and... and... and she is like
that... yes... You must excuse her,” said Sonia, and again she got up to
go."
"“But you haven’t heard what I have to say.”

“No, I haven’t heard,” muttered Sonia."
"“Then sit down.” She was terribly confused; she sat down again a third
time."
"“Seeing her position with her unfortunate little ones, I should be glad,
as I have said before, so far as lies in my power, to be of service,
that is, so far as is in my power, not more."
"One might for instance get
up a subscription for her, or a lottery, something of the sort, such as
is always arranged in such cases by friends or even outsiders desirous
of assisting people."
"It was of that I intended to speak to you; it might
be done.”

“Yes, yes... God will repay you for it,” faltered Sonia, gazing intently
at Pyotr Petrovitch."
"“It might be, but we will talk of it later."
"We might begin it to-day, we
will talk it over this evening and lay the foundation so to speak."
"Come
to me at seven o’clock."
"Mr. Lebeziatnikov, I hope, will assist us."
"But
there is one circumstance of which I ought to warn you beforehand and
for which I venture to trouble you, Sofya Semyonovna, to come here."
"In
my opinion money cannot be, indeed it’s unsafe to put it into Katerina
Ivanovna’s own hands."
The dinner to-day is a proof of that.
"Though she
has not, so to speak, a crust of bread for to-morrow and... well, boots
or shoes, or anything; she has bought to-day Jamaica rum, and even,
I believe, Madeira and... and coffee."
I saw it as I passed through.
"To-morrow it will all fall upon you again, they won’t have a crust of
bread."
"It’s absurd, really, and so, to my thinking, a subscription ought
to be raised so that the unhappy widow should not know of the money, but
only you, for instance."
"Am I right?”

“I don’t know... this is only to-day, once in her life.... She was
so anxious to do honour, to celebrate the memory.... And she is very
sensible... but just as you think and I shall be very, very... they will
all be... and God will reward... and the orphans...”

Sonia burst into tears."
"“Very well, then, keep it in mind; and now will you accept for the
benefit of your relation the small sum that I am able to spare, from me
personally."
"I am very anxious that my name should not be mentioned in
connection with it."
"Here... having so to speak anxieties of my own, I
cannot do more...”

And Pyotr Petrovitch held out to Sonia a ten-rouble note carefully
unfolded."
"Sonia took it, flushed crimson, jumped up, muttered something
and began taking leave."
"Pyotr Petrovitch accompanied her ceremoniously
to the door."
"She got out of the room at last, agitated and distressed,
and returned to Katerina Ivanovna, overwhelmed with confusion."
"All this time Lebeziatnikov had stood at the window or walked about the
room, anxious not to interrupt the conversation; when Sonia had gone he
walked up to Pyotr Petrovitch and solemnly held out his hand."
"“I heard and _saw_ everything,” he said, laying stress on the last verb."
"“That is honourable, I mean to say, it’s humane!"
"You wanted to avoid
gratitude, I saw!"
"And although I cannot, I confess, in principle
sympathise with private charity, for it not only fails to eradicate the
evil but even promotes it, yet I must admit that I saw your action with
pleasure--yes, yes, I like it.”

“That’s all nonsense,” muttered Pyotr Petrovitch, somewhat disconcerted,
looking carefully at Lebeziatnikov."
"“No, it’s not nonsense!"
"A man who has suffered distress and annoyance as
you did yesterday and who yet can sympathise with the misery of others,
such a man... even though he is making a social mistake--is still
deserving of respect!"
"I did not expect it indeed of you, Pyotr
Petrovitch, especially as according to your ideas... oh, what a drawback
your ideas are to you!"
"How distressed you are for instance by your
ill-luck yesterday,” cried the simple-hearted Lebeziatnikov, who felt
a return of affection for Pyotr Petrovitch."
"“And, what do you want with
marriage, with _legal_ marriage, my dear, noble Pyotr Petrovitch?"
"Why do
you cling to this _legality_ of marriage?"
"Well, you may beat me if you
like, but I am glad, positively glad it hasn’t come off, that you are
free, that you are not quite lost for humanity.... you see, I’ve spoken
my mind!”

“Because I don’t want in your free marriage to be made a fool of and
to bring up another man’s children, that’s why I want legal marriage,”
 Luzhin replied in order to make some answer."
He seemed preoccupied by something.
“Children?
"You referred to children,” Lebeziatnikov started off like
a warhorse at the trumpet call."
"“Children are a social question and a
question of first importance, I agree; but the question of children has
another solution."
"Some refuse to have children altogether, because they
suggest the institution of the family."
"We’ll speak of children later,
but now as to the question of honour, I confess that’s my weak point."
"That horrid, military, Pushkin expression is unthinkable in the
dictionary of the future."
What does it mean indeed?
"It’s nonsense,
there will be no deception in a free marriage!"
"That is only the natural
consequence of a legal marriage, so to say, its corrective, a protest."
"So that indeed it’s not humiliating... and if I ever, to suppose an
absurdity, were to be legally married, I should be positively glad of
it."
"I should say to my wife: ‘My dear, hitherto I have loved you, now
I respect you, for you’ve shown you can protest!’ You laugh!"
"That’s
because you are incapable of getting away from prejudices."
"Confound
it all!"
"I understand now where the unpleasantness is of being deceived
in a legal marriage, but it’s simply a despicable consequence of a
despicable position in which both are humiliated."
"When the deception is
open, as in a free marriage, then it does not exist, it’s unthinkable."
"Your wife will only prove how she respects you by considering you
incapable of opposing her happiness and avenging yourself on her for
her new husband."
Damn it all!
"I sometimes dream if I were to be married,
pfoo!"
"I mean if I were to marry, legally or not, it’s just the same,
I should present my wife with a lover if she had not found one for
herself."
"‘My dear,’ I should say, ‘I love you, but even more than that I
desire you to respect me."
"See!’ Am I not right?”

Pyotr Petrovitch sniggered as he listened, but without much merriment."
He hardly heard it indeed.
"He was preoccupied with something else and
even Lebeziatnikov at last noticed it."
"Pyotr Petrovitch seemed excited
and rubbed his hands."
"Lebeziatnikov remembered all this and reflected
upon it afterwards."
"CHAPTER II

It would be difficult to explain exactly what could have originated the
idea of that senseless dinner in Katerina Ivanovna’s disordered brain."
"Nearly ten of the twenty roubles, given by Raskolnikov for Marmeladov’s
funeral, were wasted upon it."
"Possibly Katerina Ivanovna felt obliged to
honour the memory of the deceased “suitably,” that all the lodgers,
and still more Amalia Ivanovna, might know “that he was in no way their
inferior, and perhaps very much their superior,” and that no one had the
right “to turn up his nose at him.” Perhaps the chief element was that
peculiar “poor man’s pride,” which compels many poor people to spend
their last savings on some traditional social ceremony, simply in order
to do “like other people,” and not to “be looked down upon.” It is very
probable, too, that Katerina Ivanovna longed on this occasion, at
the moment when she seemed to be abandoned by everyone, to show those
“wretched contemptible lodgers” that she knew “how to do things, how
to entertain” and that she had been brought up “in a genteel, she might
almost say aristocratic colonel’s family” and had not been meant for
sweeping floors and washing the children’s rags at night."
"Even the
poorest and most broken-spirited people are sometimes liable to these
paroxysms of pride and vanity which take the form of an irresistible
nervous craving."
"And Katerina Ivanovna was not broken-spirited; she
might have been killed by circumstance, but her spirit could not have
been broken, that is, she could not have been intimidated, her will
could not be crushed."
"Moreover Sonia had said with good reason that her
mind was unhinged."
"She could not be said to be insane, but for a year
past she had been so harassed that her mind might well be overstrained."
"The later stages of consumption are apt, doctors tell us, to affect the
intellect."
"There was no great variety of wines, nor was there Madeira; but wine
there was."
"There was vodka, rum and Lisbon wine, all of the poorest
quality but in sufficient quantity."
"Besides the traditional rice and
honey, there were three or four dishes, one of which consisted of
pancakes, all prepared in Amalia Ivanovna’s kitchen."
"Two samovars were
boiling, that tea and punch might be offered after dinner."
"Katerina
Ivanovna had herself seen to purchasing the provisions, with the help
of one of the lodgers, an unfortunate little Pole who had somehow been
stranded at Madame Lippevechsel’s."
"He promptly put himself at Katerina
Ivanovna’s disposal and had been all that morning and all the day before
running about as fast as his legs could carry him, and very anxious
that everyone should be aware of it."
"For every trifle he ran to Katerina
Ivanovna, even hunting her out at the bazaar, at every instant called
her “_Pani_.” She was heartily sick of him before the end, though
she had declared at first that she could not have got on without this
“serviceable and magnanimous man.” It was one of Katerina Ivanovna’s
characteristics to paint everyone she met in the most glowing colours."
"Her praises were so exaggerated as sometimes to be embarrassing; she
would invent various circumstances to the credit of her new acquaintance
and quite genuinely believe in their reality."
"Then all of a sudden she
would be disillusioned and would rudely and contemptuously repulse the
person she had only a few hours before been literally adoring."
"She
was naturally of a gay, lively and peace-loving disposition, but from
continual failures and misfortunes she had come to desire so _keenly_
that all should live in peace and joy and should not _dare_ to break the
peace, that the slightest jar, the smallest disaster reduced her almost
to frenzy, and she would pass in an instant from the brightest hopes and
fancies to cursing her fate and raving, and knocking her head against
the wall."
"Amalia Ivanovna, too, suddenly acquired extraordinary importance in
Katerina Ivanovna’s eyes and was treated by her with extraordinary
respect, probably only because Amalia Ivanovna had thrown herself heart
and soul into the preparations."
"She had undertaken to lay the table,
to provide the linen, crockery, etc., and to cook the dishes in her
kitchen, and Katerina Ivanovna had left it all in her hands and gone
herself to the cemetery."
Everything had been well done.
"Even the
table-cloth was nearly clean; the crockery, knives, forks and glasses
were, of course, of all shapes and patterns, lent by different lodgers,
but the table was properly laid at the time fixed, and Amalia Ivanovna,
feeling she had done her work well, had put on a black silk dress and
a cap with new mourning ribbons and met the returning party with some
pride."
"This pride, though justifiable, displeased Katerina Ivanovna for
some reason: “as though the table could not have been laid except by
Amalia Ivanovna!” She disliked the cap with new ribbons, too."
"“Could she
be stuck up, the stupid German, because she was mistress of the house,
and had consented as a favour to help her poor lodgers!"
As a favour!
Fancy that!
"Katerina Ivanovna’s father who had been a colonel and almost
a governor had sometimes had the table set for forty persons, and then
anyone like Amalia Ivanovna, or rather Ludwigovna, would not have been
allowed into the kitchen.”

Katerina Ivanovna, however, put off expressing her feelings for the
time and contented herself with treating her coldly, though she decided
inwardly that she would certainly have to put Amalia Ivanovna down
and set her in her proper place, for goodness only knew what she was
fancying herself."
"Katerina Ivanovna was irritated too by the fact that
hardly any of the lodgers invited had come to the funeral, except
the Pole who had just managed to run into the cemetery, while to the
memorial dinner the poorest and most insignificant of them had turned
up, the wretched creatures, many of them not quite sober."
"The older
and more respectable of them all, as if by common consent, stayed away."
"Pyotr Petrovitch Luzhin, for instance, who might be said to be the most
respectable of all the lodgers, did not appear, though Katerina Ivanovna
had the evening before told all the world, that is Amalia Ivanovna,
Polenka, Sonia and the Pole, that he was the most generous,
noble-hearted man with a large property and vast connections, who had
been a friend of her first husband’s, and a guest in her father’s
house, and that he had promised to use all his influence to secure her
a considerable pension."
"It must be noted that when Katerina Ivanovna
exalted anyone’s connections and fortune, it was without any ulterior
motive, quite disinterestedly, for the mere pleasure of adding to
the consequence of the person praised."
"Probably “taking his cue” from
Luzhin, “that contemptible wretch Lebeziatnikov had not turned up
either."
What did he fancy himself?
"He was only asked out of kindness
and because he was sharing the same room with Pyotr Petrovitch and was a
friend of his, so that it would have been awkward not to invite him.”

Among those who failed to appear were “the genteel lady and her
old-maidish daughter,” who had only been lodgers in the house for the
last fortnight, but had several times complained of the noise and uproar
in Katerina Ivanovna’s room, especially when Marmeladov had come
back drunk."
"Katerina Ivanovna heard this from Amalia Ivanovna who,
quarrelling with Katerina Ivanovna, and threatening to turn the whole
family out of doors, had shouted at her that they “were not worth the
foot” of the honourable lodgers whom they were disturbing."
"Katerina
Ivanovna determined now to invite this lady and her daughter, “whose
foot she was not worth,” and who had turned away haughtily when she
casually met them, so that they might know that “she was more noble in
her thoughts and feelings and did not harbour malice,” and might see
that she was not accustomed to her way of living."
"She had proposed to
make this clear to them at dinner with allusions to her late father’s
governorship, and also at the same time to hint that it was exceedingly
stupid of them to turn away on meeting her."
"The fat colonel-major (he
was really a discharged officer of low rank) was also absent, but it
appeared that he had been “not himself” for the last two days."
"The party
consisted of the Pole, a wretched looking clerk with a spotty face and
a greasy coat, who had not a word to say for himself, and smelt
abominably, a deaf and almost blind old man who had once been in the
post office and who had been from immemorial ages maintained by someone
at Amalia Ivanovna’s."
"A retired clerk of the commissariat department came, too; he was
drunk, had a loud and most unseemly laugh and only fancy--was without
a waistcoat!"
"One of the visitors sat straight down to the table without
even greeting Katerina Ivanovna."
"Finally one person having no suit
appeared in his dressing-gown, but this was too much, and the efforts of
Amalia Ivanovna and the Pole succeeded in removing him."
"The Pole brought
with him, however, two other Poles who did not live at Amalia Ivanovna’s
and whom no one had seen here before."
"All this irritated Katerina
Ivanovna intensely."
"“For whom had they made all these preparations
then?” To make room for the visitors the children had not even been laid
for at the table; but the two little ones were sitting on a bench in the
furthest corner with their dinner laid on a box, while Polenka as a big
girl had to look after them, feed them, and keep their noses wiped like
well-bred children’s."
"Katerina Ivanovna, in fact, could hardly help meeting her guests with
increased dignity, and even haughtiness."
"She stared at some of them with
special severity, and loftily invited them to take their seats."
"Rushing
to the conclusion that Amalia Ivanovna must be responsible for those who
were absent, she began treating her with extreme nonchalance, which the
latter promptly observed and resented."
"Such a beginning was no good omen
for the end."
All were seated at last.
"Raskolnikov came in almost at the moment of their return from the
cemetery."
"Katerina Ivanovna was greatly delighted to see him, in the
first place, because he was the one “educated visitor, and, as everyone
knew, was in two years to take a professorship in the university,” and
secondly because he immediately and respectfully apologised for having
been unable to be at the funeral."
"She positively pounced upon him, and
made him sit on her left hand (Amalia Ivanovna was on her right)."
"In
spite of her continual anxiety that the dishes should be passed round
correctly and that everyone should taste them, in spite of the agonising
cough which interrupted her every minute and seemed to have grown worse
during the last few days, she hastened to pour out in a half whisper to
Raskolnikov all her suppressed feelings and her just indignation at
the failure of the dinner, interspersing her remarks with lively and
uncontrollable laughter at the expense of her visitors and especially of
her landlady."
“It’s all that cuckoo’s fault!
You know whom I mean?
"Her, her!” Katerina
Ivanovna nodded towards the landlady."
"“Look at her, she’s making round
eyes, she feels that we are talking about her and can’t understand."
"Pfoo, the owl!"
Ha-ha!
(Cough-cough-cough.)
"And what does she put on that
cap for?"
(Cough-cough-cough.)
"Have you noticed that she wants everyone
to consider that she is patronising me and doing me an honour by being
here?"
"I asked her like a sensible woman to invite people, especially
those who knew my late husband, and look at the set of fools she has
brought!"
The sweeps!
Look at that one with the spotty face.
"And those
wretched Poles, ha-ha-ha!"
(Cough-cough-cough.)
"Not one of them has ever
poked his nose in here, I’ve never set eyes on them."
"What have they come
here for, I ask you?"
There they sit in a row.
"Hey, _pan_!” she cried
suddenly to one of them, “have you tasted the pancakes?"
Take some more!
Have some beer!
Won’t you have some vodka?
"Look, he’s jumped up and is
making his bows, they must be quite starved, poor things."
"Never mind,
let them eat!"
"They don’t make a noise, anyway, though I’m really afraid
for our landlady’s silver spoons... Amalia Ivanovna!” she addressed her
suddenly, almost aloud, “if your spoons should happen to be stolen,
I won’t be responsible, I warn you!"
"Ha-ha-ha!” She laughed turning to
Raskolnikov, and again nodding towards the landlady, in high glee at her
sally."
"“She didn’t understand, she didn’t understand again!"
"Look how
she sits with her mouth open!"
"An owl, a real owl!"
"An owl in new ribbons,
ha-ha-ha!”

Here her laugh turned again to an insufferable fit of coughing that
lasted five minutes."
"Drops of perspiration stood out on her forehead
and her handkerchief was stained with blood."
"She showed Raskolnikov
the blood in silence, and as soon as she could get her breath began
whispering to him again with extreme animation and a hectic flush on her
cheeks."
"“Do you know, I gave her the most delicate instructions, so to speak,
for inviting that lady and her daughter, you understand of whom I am
speaking?"
"It needed the utmost delicacy, the greatest nicety, but she
has managed things so that that fool, that conceited baggage, that
provincial nonentity, simply because she is the widow of a major, and
has come to try and get a pension and to fray out her skirts in the
government offices, because at fifty she paints her face (everybody
knows it)... a creature like that did not think fit to come, and has
not even answered the invitation, which the most ordinary good manners
required!"
I can’t understand why Pyotr Petrovitch has not come?
"But
where’s Sonia?"
Where has she gone?
"Ah, there she is at last!"
"what is it,
Sonia, where have you been?"
"It’s odd that even at your father’s funeral
you should be so unpunctual."
"Rodion Romanovitch, make room for her
beside you."
"That’s your place, Sonia... take what you like."
"Have some of
the cold entrée with jelly, that’s the best."
"They’ll bring the pancakes
directly."
Have they given the children some?
"Polenka, have you got
everything?"
(Cough-cough-cough.)
That’s all right.
"Be a good girl, Lida,
and, Kolya, don’t fidget with your feet; sit like a little gentleman."
"What are you saying, Sonia?”

Sonia hastened to give her Pyotr Petrovitch’s apologies, trying to
speak loud enough for everyone to hear and carefully choosing the most
respectful phrases which she attributed to Pyotr Petrovitch."
"She added
that Pyotr Petrovitch had particularly told her to say that, as soon as
he possibly could, he would come immediately to discuss _business_ alone
with her and to consider what could be done for her, etc., etc."
"Sonia knew that this would comfort Katerina Ivanovna, would flatter her
and gratify her pride."
"She sat down beside Raskolnikov; she made him a
hurried bow, glancing curiously at him."
"But for the rest of the time
she seemed to avoid looking at him or speaking to him."
"She seemed
absent-minded, though she kept looking at Katerina Ivanovna, trying
to please her."
"Neither she nor Katerina Ivanovna had been able to get
mourning; Sonia was wearing dark brown, and Katerina Ivanovna had on her
only dress, a dark striped cotton one."
The message from Pyotr Petrovitch was very successful.
"Listening to
Sonia with dignity, Katerina Ivanovna inquired with equal dignity how
Pyotr Petrovitch was, then at once whispered almost aloud to
Raskolnikov that it certainly would have been strange for a man of
Pyotr Petrovitch’s position and standing to find himself in such
“extraordinary company,” in spite of his devotion to her family and his
old friendship with her father."
"“That’s why I am so grateful to you, Rodion Romanovitch, that you have
not disdained my hospitality, even in such surroundings,” she added
almost aloud."
"“But I am sure that it was only your special affection for
my poor husband that has made you keep your promise.”

Then once more with pride and dignity she scanned her visitors, and
suddenly inquired aloud across the table of the deaf man: “Wouldn’t he
have some more meat, and had he been given some wine?” The old man made
no answer and for a long while could not understand what he was asked,
though his neighbours amused themselves by poking and shaking him."
"He
simply gazed about him with his mouth open, which only increased the
general mirth."
“What an imbecile!
"Look, look!"
Why was he brought?
"But as to Pyotr
Petrovitch, I always had confidence in him,” Katerina Ivanovna
continued, “and, of course, he is not like...” with an extremely stern
face she addressed Amalia Ivanovna so sharply and loudly that the latter
was quite disconcerted, “not like your dressed up draggletails whom
my father would not have taken as cooks into his kitchen, and my late
husband would have done them honour if he had invited them in the
goodness of his heart.”

“Yes, he was fond of drink, he was fond of it, he did drink!” cried the
commissariat clerk, gulping down his twelfth glass of vodka."
"“My late husband certainly had that weakness, and everyone knows
it,” Katerina Ivanovna attacked him at once, “but he was a kind and
honourable man, who loved and respected his family."
"The worst of it was
his good nature made him trust all sorts of disreputable people, and he
drank with fellows who were not worth the sole of his shoe."
"Would you
believe it, Rodion Romanovitch, they found a gingerbread cock in his
pocket; he was dead drunk, but he did not forget the children!”

“A cock?"
Did you say a cock?” shouted the commissariat clerk.
Katerina Ivanovna did not vouchsafe a reply.
"She sighed, lost in
thought."
"“No doubt you think, like everyone, that I was too severe with him,” she
went on, addressing Raskolnikov."
“But that’s not so!
"He respected me, he
respected me very much!"
He was a kind-hearted man!
"And how sorry I was
for him sometimes!"
"He would sit in a corner and look at me, I used to
feel so sorry for him, I used to want to be kind to him and then would
think to myself: ‘Be kind to him and he will drink again,’ it was only
by severity that you could keep him within bounds.”

“Yes, he used to get his hair pulled pretty often,” roared the
commissariat clerk again, swallowing another glass of vodka."
"“Some fools would be the better for a good drubbing, as well as having
their hair pulled."
"I am not talking of my late husband now!” Katerina
Ivanovna snapped at him."
"The flush on her cheeks grew more and more marked, her chest heaved."
"In
another minute she would have been ready to make a scene."
"Many of the
visitors were sniggering, evidently delighted."
"They began poking the
commissariat clerk and whispering something to him."
"They were evidently
trying to egg him on."
"“Allow me to ask what are you alluding to,” began the clerk, “that is
to say, whose... about whom... did you say just now..."
But I don’t care!
That’s nonsense!
Widow!
I forgive you....
"Pass!”

And he took another drink of vodka."
"Raskolnikov sat in silence, listening with disgust."
"He only ate from
politeness, just tasting the food that Katerina Ivanovna was continually
putting on his plate, to avoid hurting her feelings."
"He watched Sonia
intently."
"But Sonia became more and more anxious and distressed; she,
too, foresaw that the dinner would not end peaceably, and saw with
terror Katerina Ivanovna’s growing irritation."
"She knew that she, Sonia,
was the chief reason for the ‘genteel’ ladies’ contemptuous treatment of
Katerina Ivanovna’s invitation."
"She had heard from Amalia Ivanovna that
the mother was positively offended at the invitation and had asked the
question: “How could she let her daughter sit down beside _that young
person_?” Sonia had a feeling that Katerina Ivanovna had already heard
this and an insult to Sonia meant more to Katerina Ivanovna than an
insult to herself, her children, or her father, Sonia knew that
Katerina Ivanovna would not be satisfied now, “till she had shown those
draggletails that they were both...” To make matters worse someone
passed Sonia, from the other end of the table, a plate with two hearts
pierced with an arrow, cut out of black bread."
"Katerina Ivanovna flushed
crimson and at once said aloud across the table that the man who sent it
was “a drunken ass!”

Amalia Ivanovna was foreseeing something amiss, and at the same time
deeply wounded by Katerina Ivanovna’s haughtiness, and to restore the
good-humour of the company and raise herself in their esteem she began,
apropos of nothing, telling a story about an acquaintance of hers “Karl
from the chemist’s,” who was driving one night in a cab, and that “the
cabman wanted him to kill, and Karl very much begged him not to kill,
and wept and clasped hands, and frightened and from fear pierced his
heart.” Though Katerina Ivanovna smiled, she observed at once that
Amalia Ivanovna ought not to tell anecdotes in Russian; the latter was
still more offended, and she retorted that her “_Vater aus Berlin_ was a
very important man, and always went with his hands in pockets.” Katerina
Ivanovna could not restrain herself and laughed so much that Amalia
Ivanovna lost patience and could scarcely control herself."
"“Listen to the owl!” Katerina Ivanovna whispered at once, her
good-humour almost restored, “she meant to say he kept his hands in
his pockets, but she said he put his hands in people’s pockets."
(Cough-cough.)
"And have you noticed, Rodion Romanovitch, that all these
Petersburg foreigners, the Germans especially, are all stupider than
we!"
"Can you fancy anyone of us telling how ‘Karl from the chemist’s’
‘pierced his heart from fear’ and that the idiot, instead of punishing
the cabman, ‘clasped his hands and wept, and much begged.’ Ah, the fool!"
"And you know she fancies it’s very touching and does not suspect how
stupid she is!"
"To my thinking that drunken commissariat clerk is a great
deal cleverer, anyway one can see that he has addled his brains with
drink, but you know, these foreigners are always so well behaved
and serious.... Look how she sits glaring!"
"She is angry, ha-ha!"
(Cough-cough-cough.
")”

Regaining her good-humour, Katerina Ivanovna began at once telling
Raskolnikov that when she had obtained her pension, she intended to open
a school for the daughters of gentlemen in her native town T----."
"This was the first time she had spoken to him of the project, and she
launched out into the most alluring details."
"It suddenly appeared that
Katerina Ivanovna had in her hands the very certificate of honour of
which Marmeladov had spoken to Raskolnikov in the tavern, when he told
him that Katerina Ivanovna, his wife, had danced the shawl dance
before the governor and other great personages on leaving school."
"This
certificate of honour was obviously intended now to prove Katerina
Ivanovna’s right to open a boarding-school; but she had armed herself
with it chiefly with the object of overwhelming “those two stuck-up
draggletails” if they came to the dinner, and proving incontestably
that Katerina Ivanovna was of the most noble, “she might even say
aristocratic family, a colonel’s daughter and was far superior to
certain adventuresses who have been so much to the fore of late.” The
certificate of honour immediately passed into the hands of the drunken
guests, and Katerina Ivanovna did not try to retain it, for it actually
contained the statement _en toutes lettres_, that her father was of the
rank of a major, and also a companion of an order, so that she really
was almost the daughter of a colonel."
"Warming up, Katerina Ivanovna proceeded to enlarge on the peaceful and
happy life they would lead in T----, on the gymnasium teachers whom
she would engage to give lessons in her boarding-school, one a most
respectable old Frenchman, one Mangot, who had taught Katerina Ivanovna
herself in old days and was still living in T----, and would no doubt
teach in her school on moderate terms."
"Next she spoke of Sonia who would
go with her to T---- and help her in all her plans."
"At this someone at
the further end of the table gave a sudden guffaw."
"Though Katerina Ivanovna tried to appear to be disdainfully unaware of
it, she raised her voice and began at once speaking with conviction of
Sonia’s undoubted ability to assist her, of “her gentleness, patience,
devotion, generosity and good education,” tapping Sonia on the cheek and
kissing her warmly twice."
"Sonia flushed crimson, and Katerina Ivanovna
suddenly burst into tears, immediately observing that she was “nervous
and silly, that she was too much upset, that it was time to finish, and
as the dinner was over, it was time to hand round the tea.”

At that moment, Amalia Ivanovna, deeply aggrieved at taking no part in
the conversation, and not being listened to, made one last effort,
and with secret misgivings ventured on an exceedingly deep and weighty
observation, that “in the future boarding-school she would have to pay
particular attention to _die Wäsche_, and that there certainly must be a
good _dame_ to look after the linen, and secondly that the young ladies
must not novels at night read.”

Katerina Ivanovna, who certainly was upset and very tired, as well as
heartily sick of the dinner, at once cut short Amalia Ivanovna, saying
“she knew nothing about it and was talking nonsense, that it was the
business of the laundry maid, and not of the directress of a high-class
boarding-school to look after _die Wäsche_, and as for novel-reading,
that was simply rudeness, and she begged her to be silent.” Amalia
Ivanovna fired up and getting angry observed that she only “meant her
good,” and that “she had meant her very good,” and that “it was long
since she had paid her _gold_ for the lodgings.”

Katerina Ivanovna at once “set her down,” saying that it was a lie to
say she wished her good, because only yesterday when her dead husband
was lying on the table, she had worried her about the lodgings."
"To this
Amalia Ivanovna very appropriately observed that she had invited those
ladies, but “those ladies had not come, because those ladies _are_
ladies and cannot come to a lady who is not a lady.” Katerina Ivanovna
at once pointed out to her, that as she was a slut she could not judge
what made one really a lady."
"Amalia Ivanovna at once declared that her
“_Vater aus Berlin_ was a very, very important man, and both hands in
pockets went, and always used to say: ‘Poof!"
"poof!’” and she leapt
up from the table to represent her father, sticking her hands in her
pockets, puffing her cheeks, and uttering vague sounds resembling “poof!"
"poof!” amid loud laughter from all the lodgers, who purposely encouraged
Amalia Ivanovna, hoping for a fight."
"But this was too much for Katerina Ivanovna, and she at once declared,
so that all could hear, that Amalia Ivanovna probably never had a
father, but was simply a drunken Petersburg Finn, and had certainly once
been a cook and probably something worse."
"Amalia Ivanovna turned as red
as a lobster and squealed that perhaps Katerina Ivanovna never had a
father, “but she had a _Vater aus Berlin_ and that he wore a long coat
and always said poof-poof-poof!”

Katerina Ivanovna observed contemptuously that all knew what her family
was and that on that very certificate of honour it was stated in print
that her father was a colonel, while Amalia Ivanovna’s father--if she
really had one--was probably some Finnish milkman, but that probably she
never had a father at all, since it was still uncertain whether her name
was Amalia Ivanovna or Amalia Ludwigovna."
"At this Amalia Ivanovna, lashed to fury, struck the table with her fist,
and shrieked that she was Amalia Ivanovna, and not Ludwigovna, “that
her _Vater_ was named Johann and that he was a burgomeister, and that
Katerina Ivanovna’s _Vater_ was quite never a burgomeister.” Katerina
Ivanovna rose from her chair, and with a stern and apparently calm voice
(though she was pale and her chest was heaving) observed that “if she
dared for one moment to set her contemptible wretch of a father on a
level with her papa, she, Katerina Ivanovna, would tear her cap off her
head and trample it under foot.” Amalia Ivanovna ran about the room,
shouting at the top of her voice, that she was mistress of the house and
that Katerina Ivanovna should leave the lodgings that minute; then she
rushed for some reason to collect the silver spoons from the table."
"There was a great outcry and uproar, the children began crying."
"Sonia
ran to restrain Katerina Ivanovna, but when Amalia Ivanovna shouted
something about “the yellow ticket,” Katerina Ivanovna pushed Sonia
away, and rushed at the landlady to carry out her threat."
"At that minute the door opened, and Pyotr Petrovitch Luzhin appeared
on the threshold."
"He stood scanning the party with severe and vigilant
eyes."
Katerina Ivanovna rushed to him.
"CHAPTER III

“Pyotr Petrovitch,” she cried, “protect me... you at least!"
"Make this
foolish woman understand that she can’t behave like this to a lady in
misfortune... that there is a law for such things.... I’ll go to the
governor-general himself.... She shall answer for it.... Remembering my
father’s hospitality protect these orphans.”

“Allow me, madam...."
Allow me.” Pyotr Petrovitch waved her off.
"“Your
papa as you are well aware I had not the honour of knowing” (someone
laughed aloud) “and I do not intend to take part in your everlasting
squabbles with Amalia Ivanovna...."
"I have come here to speak of my own
affairs... and I want to have a word with your stepdaughter, Sofya...
Ivanovna, I think it is?"
"Allow me to pass.”

Pyotr Petrovitch, edging by her, went to the opposite corner where Sonia
was."
"Katerina Ivanovna remained standing where she was, as though
thunderstruck."
"She could not understand how Pyotr Petrovitch could deny
having enjoyed her father’s hospitality."
"Though she had invented it
herself, she believed in it firmly by this time."
"She was struck too
by the businesslike, dry and even contemptuous menacing tone of Pyotr
Petrovitch."
All the clamour gradually died away at his entrance.
"Not
only was this “serious business man” strikingly incongruous with the
rest of the party, but it was evident, too, that he had come upon some
matter of consequence, that some exceptional cause must have brought him
and that therefore something was going to happen."
"Raskolnikov, standing
beside Sonia, moved aside to let him pass; Pyotr Petrovitch did not
seem to notice him."
"A minute later Lebeziatnikov, too, appeared in the
doorway; he did not come in, but stood still, listening with marked
interest, almost wonder, and seemed for a time perplexed."
"“Excuse me for possibly interrupting you, but it’s a matter of
some importance,” Pyotr Petrovitch observed, addressing the company
generally."
“I am glad indeed to find other persons present.
"Amalia
Ivanovna, I humbly beg you as mistress of the house to pay careful
attention to what I have to say to Sofya Ivanovna."
"Sofya Ivanovna,”
 he went on, addressing Sonia, who was very much surprised and already
alarmed, “immediately after your visit I found that a hundred-rouble
note was missing from my table, in the room of my friend Mr.
Lebeziatnikov."
"If in any way whatever you know and will tell us where
it is now, I assure you on my word of honour and call all present to
witness that the matter shall end there."
"In the opposite case I shall be
compelled to have recourse to very serious measures and then... you must
blame yourself.”

Complete silence reigned in the room."
"Even the crying children were
still."
"Sonia stood deadly pale, staring at Luzhin and unable to say a
word."
She seemed not to understand.
Some seconds passed.
"“Well, how is it to be then?” asked Luzhin, looking intently at her."
“I don’t know....
"I know nothing about it,” Sonia articulated faintly at
last."
"“No, you know nothing?” Luzhin repeated and again he paused for some
seconds."
"“Think a moment, mademoiselle,” he began severely, but still,
as it were, admonishing her."
"“Reflect, I am prepared to give you time
for consideration."
"Kindly observe this: if I were not so entirely
convinced I should not, you may be sure, with my experience venture to
accuse you so directly."
"Seeing that for such direct accusation before
witnesses, if false or even mistaken, I should myself in a certain sense
be made responsible, I am aware of that."
"This morning I changed for
my own purposes several five-per-cent securities for the sum of
approximately three thousand roubles."
"The account is noted down in my
pocket-book."
"On my return home I proceeded to count the money--as Mr.
Lebeziatnikov will bear witness--and after counting two thousand three
hundred roubles I put the rest in my pocket-book in my coat pocket."
"About five hundred roubles remained on the table and among them three
notes of a hundred roubles each."
"At that moment you entered (at my
invitation)--and all the time you were present you were exceedingly
embarrassed; so that three times you jumped up in the middle of the
conversation and tried to make off."
"Mr. Lebeziatnikov can bear witness
to this."
"You yourself, mademoiselle, probably will not refuse to confirm
my statement that I invited you through Mr. Lebeziatnikov, solely in
order to discuss with you the hopeless and destitute position of your
relative, Katerina Ivanovna (whose dinner I was unable to attend),
and the advisability of getting up something of the nature of a
subscription, lottery or the like, for her benefit."
"You thanked me and
even shed tears."
"I describe all this as it took place, primarily to
recall it to your mind and secondly to show you that not the slightest
detail has escaped my recollection."
"Then I took a ten-rouble note from
the table and handed it to you by way of first instalment on my part
for the benefit of your relative."
Mr. Lebeziatnikov saw all this.
"Then
I accompanied you to the door--you being still in the same state of
embarrassment--after which, being left alone with Mr. Lebeziatnikov I
talked to him for ten minutes--then Mr. Lebeziatnikov went out and I
returned to the table with the money lying on it, intending to count
it and to put it aside, as I proposed doing before."
"To my surprise one
hundred-rouble note had disappeared."
Kindly consider the position.
Mr. Lebeziatnikov I cannot suspect.
"I am ashamed to allude to such
a supposition."
"I cannot have made a mistake in my reckoning, for the
minute before your entrance I had finished my accounts and found the
total correct."
"You will admit that recollecting your embarrassment, your
eagerness to get away and the fact that you kept your hands for some
time on the table, and taking into consideration your social position
and the habits associated with it, I was, so to say, with horror and
positively against my will, _compelled_ to entertain a suspicion--a
cruel, but justifiable suspicion!"
"I will add further and repeat that in
spite of my positive conviction, I realise that I run a certain risk in
making this accusation, but as you see, I could not let it pass."
"I have
taken action and I will tell you why: solely, madam, solely, owing
to your black ingratitude!"
Why!
"I invite you for the benefit of your
destitute relative, I present you with my donation of ten roubles and
you, on the spot, repay me for all that with such an action."
"It is too
bad!"
You need a lesson.
Reflect!
"Moreover, like a true friend I beg
you--and you could have no better friend at this moment--think what you
are doing, otherwise I shall be immovable!"
"Well, what do you say?”

“I have taken nothing,” Sonia whispered in terror, “you gave me ten
roubles, here it is, take it.”

Sonia pulled her handkerchief out of her pocket, untied a corner of it,
took out the ten-rouble note and gave it to Luzhin."
"“And the hundred roubles you do not confess to taking?” he insisted
reproachfully, not taking the note."
Sonia looked about her.
"All were looking at her with such awful, stern,
ironical, hostile eyes."
"She looked at Raskolnikov... he stood against
the wall, with his arms crossed, looking at her with glowing eyes."
“Good God!” broke from Sonia.
"“Amalia Ivanovna, we shall have to send word to the police and therefore
I humbly beg you meanwhile to send for the house porter,” Luzhin said
softly and even kindly."
“_Gott der Barmherzige_!
"I knew she was the thief,” cried Amalia
Ivanovna, throwing up her hands."
"“You knew it?” Luzhin caught her up, “then I suppose you had some reason
before this for thinking so."
"I beg you, worthy Amalia Ivanovna, to
remember your words which have been uttered before witnesses.”

There was a buzz of loud conversation on all sides."
"All were in
movement."
"“What!” cried Katerina Ivanovna, suddenly realising the position, and
she rushed at Luzhin."
“What!
You accuse her of stealing?
Sonia?
"Ah, the
wretches, the wretches!”

And running to Sonia she flung her wasted arms round her and held her as
in a vise."
“Sonia!
how dared you take ten roubles from him?
Foolish girl!
"Give it
to me!"
"Give me the ten roubles at once--here!”

And snatching the note from Sonia, Katerina Ivanovna crumpled it up and
flung it straight into Luzhin’s face."
"It hit him in the eye and fell
on the ground."
Amalia Ivanovna hastened to pick it up.
"Pyotr Petrovitch
lost his temper."
“Hold that mad woman!” he shouted.
"At that moment several other persons, besides Lebeziatnikov, appeared in
the doorway, among them the two ladies."
“What!
Mad?
Am I mad?
Idiot!” shrieked Katerina Ivanovna.
"“You are an
idiot yourself, pettifogging lawyer, base man!"
"Sonia, Sonia take his
money!"
Sonia a thief!
"Why, she’d give away her last penny!” and Katerina
Ivanovna broke into hysterical laughter."
"“Did you ever see such an
idiot?” she turned from side to side."
"“And you too?” she suddenly saw
the landlady, “and you too, sausage eater, you declare that she is a
thief, you trashy Prussian hen’s leg in a crinoline!"
"She hasn’t been
out of this room: she came straight from you, you wretch, and sat down
beside me, everyone saw her."
"She sat here, by Rodion Romanovitch."
"Search
her!"
"Since she’s not left the room, the money would have to be on her!"
"Search her, search her!"
"But if you don’t find it, then excuse me, my
dear fellow, you’ll answer for it!"
"I’ll go to our Sovereign, to our
Sovereign, to our gracious Tsar himself, and throw myself at his feet,
to-day, this minute!"
I am alone in the world!
They would let me in!
"Do
you think they wouldn’t?"
"You’re wrong, I will get in!"
I will get in!
You reckoned on her meekness!
You relied upon that!
"But I am not so
submissive, let me tell you!"
You’ve gone too far yourself.
"Search her,
search her!”

And Katerina Ivanovna in a frenzy shook Luzhin and dragged him towards
Sonia."
"“I am ready, I’ll be responsible... but calm yourself, madam, calm
yourself."
I see that you are not so submissive!...
"Well, well, but as to
that...” Luzhin muttered, “that ought to be before the police... though
indeed there are witnesses enough as it is...."
I am ready....
"But in
any case it’s difficult for a man... on account of her sex...."
"But with
the help of Amalia Ivanovna... though, of course, it’s not the way to do
things.... How is it to be done?”

“As you will!"
Let anyone who likes search her!” cried Katerina Ivanovna.
"“Sonia, turn out your pockets!"
See!
"Look, monster, the pocket is empty,
here was her handkerchief!"
"Here is the other pocket, look!"
"D’you see,
d’you see?”

And Katerina Ivanovna turned--or rather snatched--both pockets inside
out."
"But from the right pocket a piece of paper flew out and describing
a parabola in the air fell at Luzhin’s feet."
"Everyone saw it, several
cried out."
"Pyotr Petrovitch stooped down, picked up the paper in two
fingers, lifted it where all could see it and opened it."
"It was a
hundred-rouble note folded in eight."
"Pyotr Petrovitch held up the note
showing it to everyone."
“Thief!
Out of my lodging.
"Police, police!” yelled Amalia Ivanovna."
“They must to Siberia be sent!
"Away!”

Exclamations arose on all sides."
"Raskolnikov was silent, keeping his
eyes fixed on Sonia, except for an occasional rapid glance at Luzhin."
"Sonia stood still, as though unconscious."
"She was hardly able to feel
surprise."
"Suddenly the colour rushed to her cheeks; she uttered a cry
and hid her face in her hands."
"“No, it wasn’t I!"
I didn’t take it!
"I know nothing about it,” she cried
with a heartrending wail, and she ran to Katerina Ivanovna, who clasped
her tightly in her arms, as though she would shelter her from all the
world."
“Sonia!
Sonia!
I don’t believe it!
"You see, I don’t believe it!” she
cried in the face of the obvious fact, swaying her to and fro in her
arms like a baby, kissing her face continually, then snatching at her
hands and kissing them, too, “you took it!"
How stupid these people are!
Oh dear!
"You are fools, fools,” she cried, addressing the whole room,
“you don’t know, you don’t know what a heart she has, what a girl she
is!"
"She take it, she?"
"She’d sell her last rag, she’d go barefoot to help
you if you needed it, that’s what she is!"
"She has the yellow passport
because my children were starving, she sold herself for us!"
"Ah, husband,
husband!"
Do you see?
Do you see?
What a memorial dinner for you!
Merciful heavens!
"Defend her, why are you all standing still?"
"Rodion
Romanovitch, why don’t you stand up for her?"
"Do you believe it, too?"
"You
are not worth her little finger, all of you together!"
Good God!
"Defend
her now, at least!”

The wail of the poor, consumptive, helpless woman seemed to produce a
great effect on her audience."
"The agonised, wasted, consumptive face,
the parched blood-stained lips, the hoarse voice, the tears unrestrained
as a child’s, the trustful, childish and yet despairing prayer for help
were so piteous that everyone seemed to feel for her."
"Pyotr Petrovitch
at any rate was at once moved to _compassion_."
"“Madam, madam, this incident does not reflect upon you!” he cried
impressively, “no one would take upon himself to accuse you of being an
instigator or even an accomplice in it, especially as you have proved
her guilt by turning out her pockets, showing that you had no previous
idea of it."
"I am most ready, most ready to show compassion, if poverty,
so to speak, drove Sofya Semyonovna to it, but why did you refuse to
confess, mademoiselle?"
Were you afraid of the disgrace?
The first step?
"You lost your head, perhaps?"
One can quite understand it....
"But how
could you have lowered yourself to such an action?"
"Gentlemen,” he
addressed the whole company, “gentlemen!"
"Compassionate and, so to say,
commiserating these people, I am ready to overlook it even now in spite
of the personal insult lavished upon me!"
"And may this disgrace be a
lesson to you for the future,” he said, addressing Sonia, “and I will
carry the matter no further."
"Enough!”

Pyotr Petrovitch stole a glance at Raskolnikov."
"Their eyes met, and the
fire in Raskolnikov’s seemed ready to reduce him to ashes."
"Meanwhile
Katerina Ivanovna apparently heard nothing."
"She was kissing and hugging
Sonia like a madwoman."
"The children, too, were embracing Sonia on
all sides, and Polenka--though she did not fully understand what was
wrong--was drowned in tears and shaking with sobs, as she hid her pretty
little face, swollen with weeping, on Sonia’s shoulder."
“How vile!” a loud voice cried suddenly in the doorway.
Pyotr Petrovitch looked round quickly.
"“What vileness!” Lebeziatnikov repeated, staring him straight in the
face."
"Pyotr Petrovitch gave a positive start--all noticed it and recalled it
afterwards."
Lebeziatnikov strode into the room.
"“And you dared to call me as witness?” he said, going up to Pyotr
Petrovitch."
“What do you mean?
What are you talking about?” muttered Luzhin.
"“I mean that you... are a slanderer, that’s what my words mean!”
 Lebeziatnikov said hotly, looking sternly at him with his short-sighted
eyes."
He was extremely angry.
"Raskolnikov gazed intently at him, as though
seizing and weighing each word."
Again there was a silence.
"Pyotr
Petrovitch indeed seemed almost dumbfounded for the first moment."
"“If you mean that for me,...” he began, stammering."
"“But what’s the
matter with you?"
"Are you out of your mind?”

“I’m in my mind, but you are a scoundrel!"
"Ah, how vile!"
"I have heard
everything."
"I kept waiting on purpose to understand it, for I must own
even now it is not quite logical.... What you have done it all for I
can’t understand.”

“Why, what have I done then?"
"Give over talking in your nonsensical
riddles!"
"Or maybe you are drunk!”

“You may be a drunkard, perhaps, vile man, but I am not!"
"I never touch
vodka, for it’s against my convictions."
"Would you believe it, he, he
himself, with his own hands gave Sofya Semyonovna that hundred-rouble
note--I saw it, I was a witness, I’ll take my oath!"
"He did it, he!”
 repeated Lebeziatnikov, addressing all."
"“Are you crazy, milksop?” squealed Luzhin."
"“She is herself before
you--she herself here declared just now before everyone that I gave her
only ten roubles."
"How could I have given it to her?”

“I saw it, I saw it,” Lebeziatnikov repeated, “and though it is against
my principles, I am ready this very minute to take any oath you like
before the court, for I saw how you slipped it in her pocket."
"Only
like a fool I thought you did it out of kindness!"
"When you were saying
good-bye to her at the door, while you held her hand in one hand, with
the other, the left, you slipped the note into her pocket."
"I saw it, I
saw it!”

Luzhin turned pale."
"“What lies!” he cried impudently, “why, how could you, standing by the
window, see the note?"
You fancied it with your short-sighted eyes.
"You
are raving!”

“No, I didn’t fancy it."
"And though I was standing some way off, I saw
it all."
"And though it certainly would be hard to distinguish a note from
the window--that’s true--I knew for certain that it was a hundred-rouble
note, because, when you were going to give Sofya Semyonovna ten roubles,
you took up from the table a hundred-rouble note (I saw it because I
was standing near then, and an idea struck me at once, so that I did not
forget you had it in your hand)."
"You folded it and kept it in your hand
all the time."
"I didn’t think of it again until, when you were getting
up, you changed it from your right hand to your left and nearly dropped
it!"
"I noticed it because the same idea struck me again, that you meant
to do her a kindness without my seeing."
"You can fancy how I watched you
and I saw how you succeeded in slipping it into her pocket."
"I saw it, I
saw it, I’ll take my oath.”

Lebeziatnikov was almost breathless."
"Exclamations arose on all hands
chiefly expressive of wonder, but some were menacing in tone."
"They all
crowded round Pyotr Petrovitch."
Katerina Ivanovna flew to Lebeziatnikov.
“I was mistaken in you!
Protect her!
"You are the only one to take her
part!"
She is an orphan.
"God has sent you!”

Katerina Ivanovna, hardly knowing what she was doing, sank on her knees
before him."
"“A pack of nonsense!” yelled Luzhin, roused to fury, “it’s all nonsense
you’ve been talking!"
"‘An idea struck you, you didn’t think, you
noticed’--what does it amount to?"
"So I gave it to her on the sly on
purpose?"
What for?
With what object?
"What have I to do with this...?”

“What for?"
"That’s what I can’t understand, but that what I am telling
you is the fact, that’s certain!"
"So far from my being mistaken, you
infamous criminal man, I remember how, on account of it, a question
occurred to me at once, just when I was thanking you and pressing
your hand."
What made you put it secretly in her pocket?
"Why you did it
secretly, I mean?"
"Could it be simply to conceal it from me, knowing that
my convictions are opposed to yours and that I do not approve of private
benevolence, which effects no radical cure?"
"Well, I decided that you
really were ashamed of giving such a large sum before me."
"Perhaps,
too, I thought, he wants to give her a surprise, when she finds a whole
hundred-rouble note in her pocket."
"(For I know, some benevolent people
are very fond of decking out their charitable actions in that way.)"
"Then
the idea struck me, too, that you wanted to test her, to see whether,
when she found it, she would come to thank you."
"Then, too, that you
wanted to avoid thanks and that, as the saying is, your right hand
should not know... something of that sort, in fact."
"I thought of so
many possibilities that I put off considering it, but still thought it
indelicate to show you that I knew your secret."
"But another idea struck
me again that Sofya Semyonovna might easily lose the money before she
noticed it, that was why I decided to come in here to call her out of
the room and to tell her that you put a hundred roubles in her pocket."
"But on my way I went first to Madame Kobilatnikov’s to take them the
‘General Treatise on the Positive Method’ and especially to recommend
Piderit’s article (and also Wagner’s); then I come on here and what a
state of things I find!"
"Now could I, could I, have all these ideas and
reflections if I had not seen you put the hundred-rouble note in her
pocket?”

When Lebeziatnikov finished his long-winded harangue with the logical
deduction at the end, he was quite tired, and the perspiration streamed
from his face."
"He could not, alas, even express himself correctly
in Russian, though he knew no other language, so that he was quite
exhausted, almost emaciated after this heroic exploit."
"But his speech
produced a powerful effect."
"He had spoken with such vehemence, with such
conviction that everyone obviously believed him."
"Pyotr Petrovitch felt
that things were going badly with him."
"“What is it to do with me if silly ideas did occur to you?” he shouted,
“that’s no evidence."
"You may have dreamt it, that’s all!"
"And I tell you,
you are lying, sir."
"You are lying and slandering from some spite against
me, simply from pique, because I did not agree with your free-thinking,
godless, social propositions!”

But this retort did not benefit Pyotr Petrovitch."
"Murmurs of disapproval
were heard on all sides."
"“Ah, that’s your line now, is it!” cried Lebeziatnikov, “that’s
nonsense!"
Call the police and I’ll take my oath!
"There’s only one thing
I can’t understand: what made him risk such a contemptible action."
"Oh,
pitiful, despicable man!”

“I can explain why he risked such an action, and if necessary, I, too,
will swear to it,” Raskolnikov said at last in a firm voice, and he
stepped forward."
He appeared to be firm and composed.
"Everyone felt clearly, from the
very look of him that he really knew about it and that the mystery would
be solved."
"“Now I can explain it all to myself,” said Raskolnikov, addressing
Lebeziatnikov."
"“From the very beginning of the business, I suspected
that there was some scoundrelly intrigue at the bottom of it."
"I began
to suspect it from some special circumstances known to me only, which
I will explain at once to everyone: they account for everything."
"Your
valuable evidence has finally made everything clear to me."
"I beg all,
all to listen."
"This gentleman (he pointed to Luzhin) was recently
engaged to be married to a young lady--my sister, Avdotya Romanovna
Raskolnikov."
"But coming to Petersburg he quarrelled with me, the day
before yesterday, at our first meeting and I drove him out of my room--I
have two witnesses to prove it."
He is a very spiteful man....
"The day
before yesterday I did not know that he was staying here, in your room,
and that consequently on the very day we quarrelled--the day before
yesterday--he saw me give Katerina Ivanovna some money for the funeral,
as a friend of the late Mr. Marmeladov."
"He at once wrote a note to
my mother and informed her that I had given away all my money, not
to Katerina Ivanovna but to Sofya Semyonovna, and referred in a most
contemptible way to the... character of Sofya Semyonovna, that is,
hinted at the character of my attitude to Sofya Semyonovna."
"All this you
understand was with the object of dividing me from my mother and sister,
by insinuating that I was squandering on unworthy objects the money
which they had sent me and which was all they had."
"Yesterday evening,
before my mother and sister and in his presence, I declared that I had
given the money to Katerina Ivanovna for the funeral and not to Sofya
Semyonovna and that I had no acquaintance with Sofya Semyonovna and had
never seen her before, indeed."
"At the same time I added that he,
Pyotr Petrovitch Luzhin, with all his virtues, was not worth Sofya
Semyonovna’s little finger, though he spoke so ill of her."
"To his
question--would I let Sofya Semyonovna sit down beside my sister, I
answered that I had already done so that day."
"Irritated that my mother
and sister were unwilling to quarrel with me at his insinuations, he
gradually began being unpardonably rude to them."
"A final rupture took
place and he was turned out of the house."
"All this happened yesterday
evening."
"Now I beg your special attention: consider: if he had now
succeeded in proving that Sofya Semyonovna was a thief, he would
have shown to my mother and sister that he was almost right in his
suspicions, that he had reason to be angry at my putting my sister on
a level with Sofya Semyonovna, that, in attacking me, he was protecting
and preserving the honour of my sister, his betrothed."
"In fact he might
even, through all this, have been able to estrange me from my family,
and no doubt he hoped to be restored to favour with them; to say nothing
of revenging himself on me personally, for he has grounds for supposing
that the honour and happiness of Sofya Semyonovna are very precious to
me."
That was what he was working for!
That’s how I understand it.
"That’s
the whole reason for it and there can be no other!”

It was like this, or somewhat like this, that Raskolnikov wound up his
speech which was followed very attentively, though often interrupted by
exclamations from his audience."
"But in spite of interruptions he spoke
clearly, calmly, exactly, firmly."
"His decisive voice, his tone of
conviction and his stern face made a great impression on everyone."
"“Yes, yes, that’s it,” Lebeziatnikov assented gleefully, “that must be
it, for he asked me, as soon as Sofya Semyonovna came into our room,
whether you were here, whether I had seen you among Katerina Ivanovna’s
guests."
He called me aside to the window and asked me in secret.
"It was
essential for him that you should be here!"
"That’s it, that’s it!”

Luzhin smiled contemptuously and did not speak."
But he was very pale.
"He
seemed to be deliberating on some means of escape."
"Perhaps he would have
been glad to give up everything and get away, but at the moment this
was scarcely possible."
"It would have implied admitting the truth of
the accusations brought against him."
"Moreover, the company, which had
already been excited by drink, was now too much stirred to allow it."
"The
commissariat clerk, though indeed he had not grasped the whole position,
was shouting louder than anyone and was making some suggestions very
unpleasant to Luzhin."
"But not all those present were drunk; lodgers came
in from all the rooms."
"The three Poles were tremendously excited
and were continually shouting at him: “The _pan_ is a _lajdak_!” and
muttering threats in Polish."
"Sonia had been listening with strained
attention, though she too seemed unable to grasp it all; she seemed as
though she had just returned to consciousness."
"She did not take her
eyes off Raskolnikov, feeling that all her safety lay in him."
"Katerina
Ivanovna breathed hard and painfully and seemed fearfully exhausted."
"Amalia Ivanovna stood looking more stupid than anyone, with her mouth
wide open, unable to make out what had happened."
"She only saw that Pyotr
Petrovitch had somehow come to grief."
"Raskolnikov was attempting to speak again, but they did not let him."
Everyone was crowding round Luzhin with threats and shouts of abuse.
But Pyotr Petrovitch was not intimidated.
"Seeing that his accusation of
Sonia had completely failed, he had recourse to insolence:

“Allow me, gentlemen, allow me!"
"Don’t squeeze, let me pass!” he said,
making his way through the crowd."
"“And no threats, if you please!"
"I
assure you it will be useless, you will gain nothing by it."
"On the
contrary, you’ll have to answer, gentlemen, for violently obstructing
the course of justice."
"The thief has been more than unmasked, and I
shall prosecute."
"Our judges are not so blind and... not so drunk, and
will not believe the testimony of two notorious infidels, agitators, and
atheists, who accuse me from motives of personal revenge which they are
foolish enough to admit...."
"Yes, allow me to pass!”

“Don’t let me find a trace of you in my room!"
"Kindly leave at once, and
everything is at an end between us!"
"When I think of the trouble I’ve
been taking, the way I’ve been expounding... all this fortnight!”

“I told you myself to-day that I was going, when you tried to keep me;
now I will simply add that you are a fool."
"I advise you to see a doctor
for your brains and your short sight."
"Let me pass, gentlemen!”

He forced his way through."
"But the commissariat clerk was unwilling to
let him off so easily: he picked up a glass from the table, brandished
it in the air and flung it at Pyotr Petrovitch; but the glass flew
straight at Amalia Ivanovna."
"She screamed, and the clerk, overbalancing,
fell heavily under the table."
"Pyotr Petrovitch made his way to his room
and half an hour later had left the house."
"Sonia, timid by nature, had
felt before that day that she could be ill-treated more easily than
anyone, and that she could be wronged with impunity."
"Yet till that
moment she had fancied that she might escape misfortune by care,
gentleness and submissiveness before everyone."
"Her disappointment was
too great."
"She could, of course, bear with patience and almost without
murmur anything, even this."
"But for the first minute she felt it too
bitter."
"In spite of her triumph and her justification--when her first
terror and stupefaction had passed and she could understand it all
clearly--the feeling of her helplessness and of the wrong done to her
made her heart throb with anguish and she was overcome with hysterical
weeping."
"At last, unable to bear any more, she rushed out of the room
and ran home, almost immediately after Luzhin’s departure."
"When amidst
loud laughter the glass flew at Amalia Ivanovna, it was more than the
landlady could endure."
"With a shriek she rushed like a fury at Katerina
Ivanovna, considering her to blame for everything."
“Out of my lodgings!
At once!
"Quick march!”

And with these words she began snatching up everything she could lay
her hands on that belonged to Katerina Ivanovna, and throwing it on the
floor."
"Katerina Ivanovna, pale, almost fainting, and gasping for breath,
jumped up from the bed where she had sunk in exhaustion and darted at
Amalia Ivanovna."
"But the battle was too unequal: the landlady waved her
away like a feather."
“What!
"As though that godless calumny was not enough--this vile creature
attacks me!"
What!
"On the day of my husband’s funeral I am turned out of
my lodging!"
"After eating my bread and salt she turns me into the street,
with my orphans!"
"Where am I to go?” wailed the poor woman, sobbing and
gasping."
"“Good God!” she cried with flashing eyes, “is there no justice
upon earth?"
Whom should you protect if not us orphans?
We shall see!
"There is law and justice on earth, there is, I will find it!"
"Wait a bit,
godless creature!"
"Polenka, stay with the children, I’ll come back."
"Wait
for me, if you have to wait in the street."
"We will see whether there is
justice on earth!”

And throwing over her head that green shawl which Marmeladov had
mentioned to Raskolnikov, Katerina Ivanovna squeezed her way through the
disorderly and drunken crowd of lodgers who still filled the room, and,
wailing and tearful, she ran into the street--with a vague intention
of going at once somewhere to find justice."
"Polenka with the two little
ones in her arms crouched, terrified, on the trunk in the corner of the
room, where she waited trembling for her mother to come back."
"Amalia
Ivanovna raged about the room, shrieking, lamenting and throwing
everything she came across on the floor."
"The lodgers talked
incoherently, some commented to the best of their ability on what had
happened, others quarrelled and swore at one another, while others
struck up a song....

“Now it’s time for me to go,” thought Raskolnikov."
"“Well, Sofya
Semyonovna, we shall see what you’ll say now!”

And he set off in the direction of Sonia’s lodgings."
"CHAPTER IV

Raskolnikov had been a vigorous and active champion of Sonia against
Luzhin, although he had such a load of horror and anguish in his own
heart."
"But having gone through so much in the morning, he found a sort
of relief in a change of sensations, apart from the strong personal
feeling which impelled him to defend Sonia."
"He was agitated too,
especially at some moments, by the thought of his approaching interview
with Sonia: he _had_ to tell her who had killed Lizaveta."
"He knew the
terrible suffering it would be to him and, as it were, brushed away the
thought of it."
"So when he cried as he left Katerina Ivanovna’s, “Well,
Sofya Semyonovna, we shall see what you’ll say now!” he was still
superficially excited, still vigorous and defiant from his triumph over
Luzhin."
"But, strange to say, by the time he reached Sonia’s lodging, he
felt a sudden impotence and fear."
"He stood still in hesitation at the
door, asking himself the strange question: “Must he tell her who killed
Lizaveta?” It was a strange question because he felt at the very time
not only that he could not help telling her, but also that he could
not put off the telling."
"He did not yet know why it must be so, he
only _felt_ it, and the agonising sense of his impotence before
the inevitable almost crushed him."
"To cut short his hesitation and
suffering, he quickly opened the door and looked at Sonia from the
doorway."
"She was sitting with her elbows on the table and her face in
her hands, but seeing Raskolnikov she got up at once and came to meet
him as though she were expecting him."
"“What would have become of me but for you?” she said quickly, meeting
him in the middle of the room."
Evidently she was in haste to say this to him.
"It was what she had been
waiting for."
"Raskolnikov went to the table and sat down on the chair from which she
had only just risen."
"She stood facing him, two steps away, just as she
had done the day before."
"“Well, Sonia?” he said, and felt that his voice was trembling, “it was
all due to ‘your social position and the habits associated with it.’ Did
you understand that just now?”

Her face showed her distress."
"“Only don’t talk to me as you did yesterday,” she interrupted him."
“Please don’t begin it.
"There is misery enough without that.”

She made haste to smile, afraid that he might not like the reproach."
“I was silly to come away from there.
What is happening there now?
"I
wanted to go back directly, but I kept thinking that... you would come.”

He told her that Amalia Ivanovna was turning them out of their lodging
and that Katerina Ivanovna had run off somewhere “to seek justice.”

“My God!” cried Sonia, “let’s go at once....”

And she snatched up her cape."
"“It’s everlastingly the same thing!” said Raskolnikov, irritably."
“You’ve no thought except for them!
"Stay a little with me.”

“But... Katerina Ivanovna?”

“You won’t lose Katerina Ivanovna, you may be sure, she’ll come to you
herself since she has run out,” he added peevishly."
"“If she doesn’t find
you here, you’ll be blamed for it....”

Sonia sat down in painful suspense."
"Raskolnikov was silent, gazing at
the floor and deliberating."
"“This time Luzhin did not want to prosecute you,” he began, not looking
at Sonia, “but if he had wanted to, if it had suited his plans, he would
have sent you to prison if it had not been for Lebeziatnikov and me."
"Ah?”

“Yes,” she assented in a faint voice."
"“Yes,” she repeated, preoccupied
and distressed."
“But I might easily not have been there.
"And it was quite an accident
Lebeziatnikov’s turning up.”

Sonia was silent."
"“And if you’d gone to prison, what then?"
"Do you remember what I said
yesterday?”

Again she did not answer."
He waited.
"“I thought you would cry out again ‘don’t speak of it, leave off.’”
 Raskolnikov gave a laugh, but rather a forced one."
"“What, silence
again?” he asked a minute later."
"“We must talk about something, you
know."
"It would be interesting for me to know how you would decide a
certain ‘problem’ as Lebeziatnikov would say.” (He was beginning to lose
the thread.)"
"“No, really, I am serious."
"Imagine, Sonia, that you had
known all Luzhin’s intentions beforehand."
"Known, that is, for a fact,
that they would be the ruin of Katerina Ivanovna and the children and
yourself thrown in--since you don’t count yourself for anything--Polenka
too... for she’ll go the same way."
"Well, if suddenly it all depended on
your decision whether he or they should go on living, that is whether
Luzhin should go on living and doing wicked things, or Katerina Ivanovna
should die?"
How would you decide which of them was to die?
"I ask you?”

Sonia looked uneasily at him."
"There was something peculiar in this
hesitating question, which seemed approaching something in a roundabout
way."
"“I felt that you were going to ask some question like that,” she said,
looking inquisitively at him."
“I dare say you did.
"But how is it to be answered?”

“Why do you ask about what could not happen?” said Sonia reluctantly."
"“Then it would be better for Luzhin to go on living and doing wicked
things?"
"You haven’t dared to decide even that!”

“But I can’t know the Divine Providence.... And why do you ask what
can’t be answered?"
What’s the use of such foolish questions?
"How could
it happen that it should depend on my decision--who has made me a judge
to decide who is to live and who is not to live?”

“Oh, if the Divine Providence is to be mixed up in it, there is no doing
anything,” Raskolnikov grumbled morosely."
“You’d better say straight out what you want!” Sonia cried in distress.
"“You are leading up to something again.... Can you have come simply to
torture me?”

She could not control herself and began crying bitterly."
"He looked at
her in gloomy misery."
Five minutes passed.
"“Of course you’re right, Sonia,” he said softly at last."
"He was suddenly
changed."
His tone of assumed arrogance and helpless defiance was gone.
Even his voice was suddenly weak.
"“I told you yesterday that I was not
coming to ask forgiveness and almost the first thing I’ve said is to ask
forgiveness...."
I said that about Luzhin and Providence for my own sake.
"I was asking forgiveness, Sonia....”

He tried to smile, but there was something helpless and incomplete in
his pale smile."
He bowed his head and hid his face in his hands.
"And suddenly a strange, surprising sensation of a sort of bitter hatred
for Sonia passed through his heart."
"As it were wondering and frightened
of this sensation, he raised his head and looked intently at her; but he
met her uneasy and painfully anxious eyes fixed on him; there was
love in them; his hatred vanished like a phantom."
"It was not the real
feeling; he had taken the one feeling for the other."
"It only meant that
_that_ minute had come."
He hid his face in his hands again and bowed his head.
"Suddenly he
turned pale, got up from his chair, looked at Sonia, and without
uttering a word sat down mechanically on her bed."
"His sensations that moment were terribly like the moment when he had
stood over the old woman with the axe in his hand and felt that “he must
not lose another minute.”

“What’s the matter?” asked Sonia, dreadfully frightened."
He could not utter a word.
"This was not at all, not at all the way he
had intended to “tell” and he did not understand what was happening to
him now."
"She went up to him, softly, sat down on the bed beside him and
waited, not taking her eyes off him."
Her heart throbbed and sank.
"It
was unendurable; he turned his deadly pale face to her."
"His lips worked,
helplessly struggling to utter something."
"A pang of terror passed
through Sonia’s heart."
"“What’s the matter?” she repeated, drawing a little away from him."
"“Nothing, Sonia, don’t be frightened.... It’s nonsense."
"It really is
nonsense, if you think of it,” he muttered, like a man in delirium."
"“Why
have I come to torture you?” he added suddenly, looking at her."
"“Why,
really?"
"I keep asking myself that question, Sonia....”

He had perhaps been asking himself that question a quarter of an hour
before, but now he spoke helplessly, hardly knowing what he said and
feeling a continual tremor all over."
"“Oh, how you are suffering!” she muttered in distress, looking intently
at him."
“It’s all nonsense....
"Listen, Sonia.” He suddenly smiled, a pale
helpless smile for two seconds."
"“You remember what I meant to tell you
yesterday?”

Sonia waited uneasily."
"“I said as I went away that perhaps I was saying good-bye for ever, but
that if I came to-day I would tell you who... who killed Lizaveta.”

She began trembling all over."
"“Well, here I’ve come to tell you.”

“Then you really meant it yesterday?” she whispered with difficulty."
"“How do you know?” she asked quickly, as though suddenly regaining her
reason."
"Sonia’s face grew paler and paler, and she breathed painfully."
"“I know.”

She paused a minute."
“Have they found him?” she asked timidly.
"“No.”

“Then how do you know about _it_?” she asked again, hardly audibly and
again after a minute’s pause."
He turned to her and looked very intently at her.
"“Guess,” he said, with the same distorted helpless smile."
A shudder passed over her.
"“But you... why do you frighten me like this?” she said, smiling like a
child."
"“I must be a great friend of _his_... since I know,” Raskolnikov went
on, still gazing into her face, as though he could not turn his eyes
away."
"“He... did not mean to kill that Lizaveta... he... killed her
accidentally...."
"He meant to kill the old woman when she was alone and
he went there... and then Lizaveta came in... he killed her too.”

Another awful moment passed."
Both still gazed at one another.
"“You can’t guess, then?” he asked suddenly, feeling as though he were
flinging himself down from a steeple."
“N-no...” whispered Sonia.
"“Take a good look.”

As soon as he had said this again, the same familiar sensation froze his
heart."
"He looked at her and all at once seemed to see in her face the
face of Lizaveta."
"He remembered clearly the expression in Lizaveta’s
face, when he approached her with the axe and she stepped back to the
wall, putting out her hand, with childish terror in her face, looking
as little children do when they begin to be frightened of something,
looking intently and uneasily at what frightens them, shrinking back and
holding out their little hands on the point of crying."
"Almost the same
thing happened now to Sonia."
"With the same helplessness and the same
terror, she looked at him for a while and, suddenly putting out her left
hand, pressed her fingers faintly against his breast and slowly began to
get up from the bed, moving further from him and keeping her eyes fixed
even more immovably on him."
Her terror infected him.
"The same fear
showed itself on his face."
"In the same way he stared at her and almost
with the same _childish_ smile."
“Have you guessed?” he whispered at last.
“Good God!” broke in an awful wail from her bosom.
"She sank helplessly on the bed with her face in the pillows, but a
moment later she got up, moved quickly to him, seized both his hands
and, gripping them tight in her thin fingers, began looking into his
face again with the same intent stare."
"In this last desperate look she
tried to look into him and catch some last hope."
"But there was no hope;
there was no doubt remaining; it was all true!"
"Later on, indeed, when
she recalled that moment, she thought it strange and wondered why she
had seen at once that there was no doubt."
"She could not have said, for
instance, that she had foreseen something of the sort--and yet now, as
soon as he told her, she suddenly fancied that she had really foreseen
this very thing."
"“Stop, Sonia, enough!"
"don’t torture me,” he begged her miserably."
"It was not at all, not at all like this he had thought of telling her,
but this is how it happened."
"She jumped up, seeming not to know what she was doing, and, wringing her
hands, walked into the middle of the room; but quickly went back and sat
down again beside him, her shoulder almost touching his."
"All of a sudden
she started as though she had been stabbed, uttered a cry and fell on
her knees before him, she did not know why."
"“What have you done--what have you done to yourself?” she said in
despair, and, jumping up, she flung herself on his neck, threw her arms
round him, and held him tightly."
Raskolnikov drew back and looked at her with a mournful smile.
"“You are a strange girl, Sonia--you kiss me and hug me when I tell you
about that.... You don’t think what you are doing.”

“There is no one--no one in the whole world now so unhappy as you!” she
cried in a frenzy, not hearing what he said, and she suddenly broke into
violent hysterical weeping."
"A feeling long unfamiliar to him flooded his heart and softened it at
once."
He did not struggle against it.
"Two tears started into his eyes
and hung on his eyelashes."
"“Then you won’t leave me, Sonia?” he said, looking at her almost with
hope."
"“No, no, never, nowhere!” cried Sonia."
"“I will follow you, I will follow
you everywhere."
"Oh, my God!"
"Oh, how miserable I am!..."
"Why, why didn’t I
know you before!"
Why didn’t you come before?
"Oh, dear!”

“Here I have come.”

“Yes, now!"
What’s to be done now?...
"Together, together!” she repeated
as it were unconsciously, and she hugged him again."
"“I’ll follow you to
Siberia!”

He recoiled at this, and the same hostile, almost haughty smile came to
his lips."
"“Perhaps I don’t want to go to Siberia yet, Sonia,” he said."
Sonia looked at him quickly.
"Again after her first passionate, agonising sympathy for the unhappy man
the terrible idea of the murder overwhelmed her."
"In his changed tone she
seemed to hear the murderer speaking."
She looked at him bewildered.
"She
knew nothing as yet, why, how, with what object it had been."
"Now all
these questions rushed at once into her mind."
"And again she could not
believe it: “He, he is a murderer!"
"Could it be true?”

“What’s the meaning of it?"
"Where am I?” she said in complete
bewilderment, as though still unable to recover herself."
"“How could you,
you, a man like you.... How could you bring yourself to it?..."
"What does
it mean?”

“Oh, well--to plunder."
"Leave off, Sonia,” he answered wearily, almost
with vexation."
"Sonia stood as though struck dumb, but suddenly she cried:

“You were hungry!"
It was... to help your mother?
"Yes?”

“No, Sonia, no,” he muttered, turning away and hanging his head."
"“I was
not so hungry...."
"I certainly did want to help my mother, but... that’s
not the real thing either.... Don’t torture me, Sonia.”

Sonia clasped her hands."
"“Could it, could it all be true?"
"Good God, what a truth!"
"Who could
believe it?"
"And how could you give away your last farthing and yet
rob and murder!"
"Ah,” she cried suddenly, “that money you gave Katerina
Ivanovna... that money.... Can that money...”

“No, Sonia,” he broke in hurriedly, “that money was not it."
"Don’t worry
yourself!"
"That money my mother sent me and it came when I was ill, the
day I gave it to you.... Razumihin saw it... he received it for me....
That money was mine--my own.”

Sonia listened to him in bewilderment and did her utmost to comprehend."
“And _that_ money....
"I don’t even know really whether there was any
money,” he added softly, as though reflecting."
"“I took a purse off her
neck, made of chamois leather... a purse stuffed full of something...
but I didn’t look in it; I suppose I hadn’t time.... And the
things--chains and trinkets--I buried under a stone with the purse next
morning in a yard off the V---- Prospect."
"They are all there now....”

Sonia strained every nerve to listen."
"“Then why... why, you said you did it to rob, but you took nothing?” she
asked quickly, catching at a straw."
“I don’t know....
"I haven’t yet decided whether to take that money or
not,” he said, musing again; and, seeming to wake up with a start, he
gave a brief ironical smile."
"“Ach, what silly stuff I am talking, eh?”

The thought flashed through Sonia’s mind, wasn’t he mad?"
"But she
dismissed it at once."
"“No, it was something else.” She could make
nothing of it, nothing."
"“Do you know, Sonia,” he said suddenly with conviction, “let me tell
you: if I’d simply killed because I was hungry,” laying stress on
every word and looking enigmatically but sincerely at her, “I should
be _happy_ now."
You must believe that!
"What would it matter to you,” he
cried a moment later with a sort of despair, “what would it matter to
you if I were to confess that I did wrong?"
"What do you gain by such
a stupid triumph over me?"
"Ah, Sonia, was it for that I’ve come to you
to-day?”

Again Sonia tried to say something, but did not speak."
"“I asked you to go with me yesterday because you are all I have left.”

“Go where?” asked Sonia timidly."
"“Not to steal and not to murder, don’t be anxious,” he smiled bitterly."
"“We are so different.... And you know, Sonia, it’s only now, only this
moment that I understand _where_ I asked you to go with me yesterday!"
Yesterday when I said it I did not know where.
"I asked you for one
thing, I came to you for one thing--not to leave me."
"You won’t leave me,
Sonia?”

She squeezed his hand."
"“And why, why did I tell her?"
"Why did I let her know?” he cried a minute
later in despair, looking with infinite anguish at her."
"“Here you expect
an explanation from me, Sonia; you are sitting and waiting for it, I see
that."
But what can I tell you?
"You won’t understand and will only suffer
misery... on my account!"
"Well, you are crying and embracing me again."
Why do you do it?
"Because I couldn’t bear my burden and have come to
throw it on another: you suffer too, and I shall feel better!"
"And can
you love such a mean wretch?”

“But aren’t you suffering, too?” cried Sonia."
"Again a wave of the same feeling surged into his heart, and again for an
instant softened it."
"“Sonia, I have a bad heart, take note of that."
"It may explain a great
deal."
I have come because I am bad.
"There are men who wouldn’t have
come."
But I am a coward and... a mean wretch.
But... never mind!
"That’s
not the point."
"I must speak now, but I don’t know how to begin.”

He paused and sank into thought."
"“Ach, we are so different,” he cried again, “we are not alike."
"And why,
why did I come?"
"I shall never forgive myself that.”

“No, no, it was a good thing you came,” cried Sonia."
"“It’s better I
should know, far better!”

He looked at her with anguish."
"“What if it were really that?” he said, as though reaching a conclusion."
"“Yes, that’s what it was!"
"I wanted to become a Napoleon, that is why I
killed her.... Do you understand now?”

“N-no,” Sonia whispered naïvely and timidly."
"“Only speak, speak, I shall
understand, I shall understand _in myself_!” she kept begging him."
“You’ll understand?
"Very well, we shall see!” He paused and was for some
time lost in meditation."
"“It was like this: I asked myself one day this question--what if
Napoleon, for instance, had happened to be in my place, and if he had
not had Toulon nor Egypt nor the passage of Mont Blanc to begin his
career with, but instead of all those picturesque and monumental things,
there had simply been some ridiculous old hag, a pawnbroker, who had
to be murdered too to get money from her trunk (for his career, you
understand)."
"Well, would he have brought himself to that if there had
been no other means?"
"Wouldn’t he have felt a pang at its being so far
from monumental and... and sinful, too?"
"Well, I must tell you that I
worried myself fearfully over that ‘question’ so that I was awfully
ashamed when I guessed at last (all of a sudden, somehow) that it would
not have given him the least pang, that it would not even have struck
him that it was not monumental... that he would not have seen that there
was anything in it to pause over, and that, if he had had no other way,
he would have strangled her in a minute without thinking about it!"
"Well, I too... left off thinking about it... murdered her, following
his example."
And that’s exactly how it was!
Do you think it funny?
"Yes,
Sonia, the funniest thing of all is that perhaps that’s just how it
was.”

Sonia did not think it at all funny."
"“You had better tell me straight out... without examples,” she begged,
still more timidly and scarcely audibly."
"He turned to her, looked sadly at her and took her hands."
"“You are right again, Sonia."
"Of course that’s all nonsense, it’s almost
all talk!"
"You see, you know of course that my mother has scarcely
anything, my sister happened to have a good education and was condemned
to drudge as a governess."
All their hopes were centered on me.
"I was a
student, but I couldn’t keep myself at the university and was forced
for a time to leave it."
"Even if I had lingered on like that, in ten
or twelve years I might (with luck) hope to be some sort of teacher or
clerk with a salary of a thousand roubles” (he repeated it as though it
were a lesson) “and by that time my mother would be worn out with grief
and anxiety and I could not succeed in keeping her in comfort while my
sister... well, my sister might well have fared worse!"
"And it’s a hard
thing to pass everything by all one’s life, to turn one’s back upon
everything, to forget one’s mother and decorously accept the insults
inflicted on one’s sister."
Why should one?
"When one has buried them to
burden oneself with others--wife and children--and to leave them again
without a farthing?"
"So I resolved to gain possession of the old woman’s
money and to use it for my first years without worrying my mother,
to keep myself at the university and for a little while after leaving
it--and to do this all on a broad, thorough scale, so as to build up
a completely new career and enter upon a new life of independence....
Well... that’s all.... Well, of course in killing the old woman I did
wrong.... Well, that’s enough.”

He struggled to the end of his speech in exhaustion and let his head
sink."
"“Oh, that’s not it, that’s not it,” Sonia cried in distress."
"“How could
one... no, that’s not right, not right.”

“You see yourself that it’s not right."
"But I’ve spoken truly, it’s the
truth.”

“As though that could be the truth!"
"Good God!”

“I’ve only killed a louse, Sonia, a useless, loathsome, harmful
creature.”

“A human being--a louse!”

“I too know it wasn’t a louse,” he answered, looking strangely at
her."
"“But I am talking nonsense, Sonia,” he added."
"“I’ve been talking
nonsense a long time.... That’s not it, you are right there."
"There were
quite, quite other causes for it!"
"I haven’t talked to anyone for so
long, Sonia.... My head aches dreadfully now.”

His eyes shone with feverish brilliance."
"He was almost delirious; an
uneasy smile strayed on his lips."
"His terrible exhaustion could be seen
through his excitement."
Sonia saw how he was suffering.
"She too
was growing dizzy."
"And he talked so strangely; it seemed somehow
comprehensible, but yet... “But how, how!"
"Good God!” And she wrung her
hands in despair."
"“No, Sonia, that’s not it,” he began again suddenly, raising his head,
as though a new and sudden train of thought had struck and as it were
roused him--“that’s not it!"
"Better... imagine--yes, it’s certainly
better--imagine that I am vain, envious, malicious, base, vindictive
and... well, perhaps with a tendency to insanity."
"(Let’s have it all out
at once!"
"They’ve talked of madness already, I noticed.)"
"I told you just
now I could not keep myself at the university."
"But do you know that
perhaps I might have done?"
"My mother would have sent me what I needed
for the fees and I could have earned enough for clothes, boots and food,
no doubt."
Lessons had turned up at half a rouble.
Razumihin works!
"But I
turned sulky and wouldn’t."
"(Yes, sulkiness, that’s the right word for
it!)"
I sat in my room like a spider.
"You’ve been in my den, you’ve seen
it.... And do you know, Sonia, that low ceilings and tiny rooms cramp
the soul and the mind?"
"Ah, how I hated that garret!"
"And yet I wouldn’t
go out of it!"
I wouldn’t on purpose!
"I didn’t go out for days together,
and I wouldn’t work, I wouldn’t even eat, I just lay there doing
nothing."
"If Nastasya brought me anything, I ate it, if she didn’t, I
went all day without; I wouldn’t ask, on purpose, from sulkiness!"
"At
night I had no light, I lay in the dark and I wouldn’t earn money for
candles."
"I ought to have studied, but I sold my books; and the dust lies
an inch thick on the notebooks on my table."
"I preferred lying still and
thinking."
"And I kept thinking.... And I had dreams all the time, strange
dreams of all sorts, no need to describe!"
"Only then I began to fancy
that... No, that’s not it!"
Again I am telling you wrong!
"You see I kept
asking myself then: why am I so stupid that if others are stupid--and I
know they are--yet I won’t be wiser?"
"Then I saw, Sonia, that if one
waits for everyone to get wiser it will take too long...."
"Afterwards I
understood that that would never come to pass, that men won’t change and
that nobody can alter it and that it’s not worth wasting effort over it."
"Yes, that’s so."
"That’s the law of their nature, Sonia,... that’s so!..."
"And I know now, Sonia, that whoever is strong in mind and spirit will
have power over them."
"Anyone who is greatly daring is right in their
eyes."
"He who despises most things will be a lawgiver among them and he
who dares most of all will be most in the right!"
"So it has been till now
and so it will always be."
"A man must be blind not to see it!”

Though Raskolnikov looked at Sonia as he said this, he no longer cared
whether she understood or not."
"The fever had complete hold of him; he
was in a sort of gloomy ecstasy (he certainly had been too long without
talking to anyone)."
"Sonia felt that his gloomy creed had become his
faith and code."
"“I divined then, Sonia,” he went on eagerly, “that power is only
vouchsafed to the man who dares to stoop and pick it up."
"There is only
one thing, one thing needful: one has only to dare!"
"Then for the first
time in my life an idea took shape in my mind which no one had ever
thought of before me, no one!"
"I saw clear as daylight how strange it is
that not a single person living in this mad world has had the daring to
go straight for it all and send it flying to the devil!"
I...
"I wanted
_to have the daring_... and I killed her."
"I only wanted to have the
daring, Sonia!"
"That was the whole cause of it!”

“Oh hush, hush,” cried Sonia, clasping her hands."
"“You turned away from
God and God has smitten you, has given you over to the devil!”

“Then Sonia, when I used to lie there in the dark and all this became
clear to me, was it a temptation of the devil, eh?”

“Hush, don’t laugh, blasphemer!"
"You don’t understand, you don’t
understand!"
Oh God!
"He won’t understand!”

“Hush, Sonia!"
I am not laughing.
"I know myself that it was the devil
leading me."
"Hush, Sonia, hush!” he repeated with gloomy insistence."
"“I
know it all, I have thought it all over and over and whispered it all
over to myself, lying there in the dark.... I’ve argued it all over with
myself, every point of it, and I know it all, all!"
"And how sick, how
sick I was then of going over it all!"
"I have kept wanting to forget it
and make a new beginning, Sonia, and leave off thinking."
"And you don’t
suppose that I went into it headlong like a fool?"
"I went into it like a
wise man, and that was just my destruction."
"And you mustn’t suppose that
I didn’t know, for instance, that if I began to question myself whether
I had the right to gain power--I certainly hadn’t the right--or that if
I asked myself whether a human being is a louse it proved that it wasn’t
so for me, though it might be for a man who would go straight to his
goal without asking questions...."
"If I worried myself all those days,
wondering whether Napoleon would have done it or not, I felt clearly
of course that I wasn’t Napoleon."
"I had to endure all the agony of that
battle of ideas, Sonia, and I longed to throw it off: I wanted to murder
without casuistry, to murder for my own sake, for myself alone!"
"I didn’t
want to lie about it even to myself."
"It wasn’t to help my mother I did
the murder--that’s nonsense--I didn’t do the murder to gain wealth and
power and to become a benefactor of mankind."
Nonsense!
"I simply did it;
I did the murder for myself, for myself alone, and whether I became a
benefactor to others, or spent my life like a spider catching men in
my web and sucking the life out of men, I couldn’t have cared at that
moment.... And it was not the money I wanted, Sonia, when I did it."
"It
was not so much the money I wanted, but something else...."
"I know it all
now...."
Understand me!
"Perhaps I should never have committed a murder
again."
"I wanted to find out something else; it was something else led
me on."
"I wanted to find out then and quickly whether I was a louse
like everybody else or a man."
"Whether I can step over barriers or
not, whether I dare stoop to pick up or not, whether I am a trembling
creature or whether I have the _right_...”

“To kill?"
Have the right to kill?” Sonia clasped her hands.
"“Ach, Sonia!” he cried irritably and seemed about to make some retort,
but was contemptuously silent."
"“Don’t interrupt me, Sonia."
"I want to
prove one thing only, that the devil led me on then and he has shown me
since that I had not the right to take that path, because I am just such
a louse as all the rest."
"He was mocking me and here I’ve come to you
now!"
Welcome your guest!
"If I were not a louse, should I have come to
you?"
"Listen: when I went then to the old woman’s I only went to
_try_.... You may be sure of that!”

“And you murdered her!”

“But how did I murder her?"
Is that how men do murders?
"Do men go to
commit a murder as I went then?"
I will tell you some day how I went!
Did I murder the old woman?
"I murdered myself, not her!"
"I crushed myself
once for all, for ever...."
"But it was the devil that killed that old
woman, not I."
"Enough, enough, Sonia, enough!"
"Let me be!” he cried in a
sudden spasm of agony, “let me be!”

He leaned his elbows on his knees and squeezed his head in his hands as
in a vise."
“What suffering!” A wail of anguish broke from Sonia.
"“Well, what am I to do now?” he asked, suddenly raising his head and
looking at her with a face hideously distorted by despair."
"“What are you to do?” she cried, jumping up, and her eyes that had been
full of tears suddenly began to shine."
"“Stand up!” (She seized him by
the shoulder, he got up, looking at her almost bewildered.)"
"“Go at once,
this very minute, stand at the cross-roads, bow down, first kiss the
earth which you have defiled and then bow down to all the world and say
to all men aloud, ‘I am a murderer!’ Then God will send you life again."
"Will you go, will you go?” she asked him, trembling all over, snatching
his two hands, squeezing them tight in hers and gazing at him with eyes
full of fire."
He was amazed at her sudden ecstasy.
"“You mean Siberia, Sonia?"
I must give myself up?” he asked gloomily.
"“Suffer and expiate your sin by it, that’s what you must do.”

“No!"
"I am not going to them, Sonia!”

“But how will you go on living?"
"What will you live for?” cried Sonia,
“how is it possible now?"
"Why, how can you talk to your mother?"
"(Oh, what
will become of them now?)"
But what am I saying?
"You have abandoned your
mother and your sister already."
He has abandoned them already!
"Oh,
God!” she cried, “why, he knows it all himself."
"How, how can he live by
himself!"
"What will become of you now?”

“Don’t be a child, Sonia,” he said softly."
"“What wrong have I done
them?"
Why should I go to them?
What should I say to them?
"That’s only a
phantom...."
"They destroy men by millions themselves and look on it as a
virtue."
"They are knaves and scoundrels, Sonia!"
I am not going to them.
"And what should I say to them--that I murdered her, but did not dare to
take the money and hid it under a stone?” he added with a bitter smile."
"“Why, they would laugh at me, and would call me a fool for not getting
it."
A coward and a fool!
"They wouldn’t understand and they don’t deserve
to understand."
Why should I go to them?
I won’t.
"Don’t be a child,
Sonia....”

“It will be too much for you to bear, too much!” she repeated, holding
out her hands in despairing supplication."
"“Perhaps I’ve been unfair to myself,” he observed gloomily, pondering,
“perhaps after all I am a man and not a louse and I’ve been in too great
a hurry to condemn myself."
"I’ll make another fight for it.”

A haughty smile appeared on his lips."
“What a burden to bear!
"And your whole life, your whole life!”

“I shall get used to it,” he said grimly and thoughtfully."
"“Listen,” he
began a minute later, “stop crying, it’s time to talk of the facts: I’ve
come to tell you that the police are after me, on my track....”

“Ach!” Sonia cried in terror."
"“Well, why do you cry out?"
"You want me to go to Siberia and now you are
frightened?"
But let me tell you: I shall not give myself up.
"I shall
make a struggle for it and they won’t do anything to me."
"They’ve no real
evidence."
"Yesterday I was in great danger and believed I was lost; but
to-day things are going better."
"All the facts they know can be explained
two ways, that’s to say I can turn their accusations to my credit, do
you understand?"
"And I shall, for I’ve learnt my lesson."
"But they will
certainly arrest me."
"If it had not been for something that happened,
they would have done so to-day for certain; perhaps even now they will
arrest me to-day...."
"But that’s no matter, Sonia; they’ll let me out
again... for there isn’t any real proof against me, and there won’t be,
I give you my word for it."
"And they can’t convict a man on what they
have against me."
Enough....
I only tell you that you may know....
"I will
try to manage somehow to put it to my mother and sister so that they
won’t be frightened.... My sister’s future is secure, however, now, I
believe... and my mother’s must be too.... Well, that’s all."
"Be careful,
though."
"Will you come and see me in prison when I am there?”

“Oh, I will, I will.”

They sat side by side, both mournful and dejected, as though they had
been cast up by the tempest alone on some deserted shore."
"He looked at
Sonia and felt how great was her love for him, and strange to say he
felt it suddenly burdensome and painful to be so loved."
"Yes, it was a
strange and awful sensation!"
"On his way to see Sonia he had felt that
all his hopes rested on her; he expected to be rid of at least part
of his suffering, and now, when all her heart turned towards him, he
suddenly felt that he was immeasurably unhappier than before."
"“Sonia,” he said, “you’d better not come and see me when I am in
prison.”

Sonia did not answer, she was crying."
Several minutes passed.
"“Have you a cross on you?” she asked, as though suddenly thinking of it."
He did not at first understand the question.
"“No, of course not."
"Here, take this one, of cypress wood."
"I have
another, a copper one that belonged to Lizaveta."
"I changed with
Lizaveta: she gave me her cross and I gave her my little ikon."
"I will
wear Lizaveta’s now and give you this."
Take it... it’s mine!
"It’s mine,
you know,” she begged him."
"“We will go to suffer together, and together
we will bear our cross!”

“Give it me,” said Raskolnikov."
He did not want to hurt her feelings.
"But immediately he drew back the
hand he held out for the cross."
"“Not now, Sonia."
"Better later,” he added to comfort her."
"“Yes, yes, better,” she repeated with conviction, “when you go to meet
your suffering, then put it on."
"You will come to me, I’ll put it on you,
we will pray and go together.”

At that moment someone knocked three times at the door."
"“Sofya Semyonovna, may I come in?” they heard in a very familiar and
polite voice."
Sonia rushed to the door in a fright.
"The flaxen head of Mr.
Lebeziatnikov appeared at the door."
"CHAPTER V

Lebeziatnikov looked perturbed."
"“I’ve come to you, Sofya Semyonovna,” he began."
“Excuse me...
"I thought
I should find you,” he said, addressing Raskolnikov suddenly, “that is,
I didn’t mean anything... of that sort..."
"But I just thought... Katerina
Ivanovna has gone out of her mind,” he blurted out suddenly, turning
from Raskolnikov to Sonia."
Sonia screamed.
“At least it seems so.
"But... we don’t know what to do, you see!"
"She
came back--she seems to have been turned out somewhere, perhaps
beaten...."
"So it seems at least,... She had run to your father’s former
chief, she didn’t find him at home: he was dining at some other
general’s.... Only fancy, she rushed off there, to the other general’s,
and, imagine, she was so persistent that she managed to get the chief to
see her, had him fetched out from dinner, it seems."
"You can imagine what
happened."
"She was turned out, of course; but, according to her own
story, she abused him and threw something at him."
"One may well believe
it.... How it is she wasn’t taken up, I can’t understand!"
"Now she is
telling everyone, including Amalia Ivanovna; but it’s difficult to
understand her, she is screaming and flinging herself about.... Oh yes,
she shouts that since everyone has abandoned her, she will take the
children and go into the street with a barrel-organ, and the children
will sing and dance, and she too, and collect money, and will go every
day under the general’s window... ‘to let everyone see well-born
children, whose father was an official, begging in the street.’ She
keeps beating the children and they are all crying."
"She is teaching Lida
to sing ‘My Village,’ the boy to dance, Polenka the same."
"She is tearing
up all the clothes, and making them little caps like actors; she means
to carry a tin basin and make it tinkle, instead of music.... She won’t
listen to anything...."
Imagine the state of things!
"It’s beyond
anything!”

Lebeziatnikov would have gone on, but Sonia, who had heard him almost
breathless, snatched up her cloak and hat, and ran out of the room,
putting on her things as she went."
"Raskolnikov followed her and
Lebeziatnikov came after him."
"“She has certainly gone mad!” he said to Raskolnikov, as they went out
into the street."
"“I didn’t want to frighten Sofya Semyonovna, so I said
‘it seemed like it,’ but there isn’t a doubt of it."
"They say that in
consumption the tubercles sometimes occur in the brain; it’s a pity I
know nothing of medicine."
"I did try to persuade her, but she wouldn’t
listen.”

“Did you talk to her about the tubercles?”

“Not precisely of the tubercles."
"Besides, she wouldn’t have understood!"
"But what I say is, that if you convince a person logically that he
has nothing to cry about, he’ll stop crying."
That’s clear.
"Is it your
conviction that he won’t?”

“Life would be too easy if it were so,” answered Raskolnikov."
"“Excuse me, excuse me; of course it would be rather difficult for
Katerina Ivanovna to understand, but do you know that in Paris they have
been conducting serious experiments as to the possibility of curing the
insane, simply by logical argument?"
"One professor there, a scientific
man of standing, lately dead, believed in the possibility of such
treatment."
"His idea was that there’s nothing really wrong with the
physical organism of the insane, and that insanity is, so to say, a
logical mistake, an error of judgment, an incorrect view of things."
"He
gradually showed the madman his error and, would you believe it, they
say he was successful?"
"But as he made use of douches too, how far
success was due to that treatment remains uncertain...."
"So it seems at
least.”

Raskolnikov had long ceased to listen."
"Reaching the house where he
lived, he nodded to Lebeziatnikov and went in at the gate."
"Lebeziatnikov
woke up with a start, looked about him and hurried on."
"Raskolnikov went into his little room and stood still in the middle
of it."
Why had he come back here?
"He looked at the yellow and tattered
paper, at the dust, at his sofa.... From the yard came a loud continuous
knocking; someone seemed to be hammering..."
"He went to the window, rose
on tiptoe and looked out into the yard for a long time with an air of
absorbed attention."
"But the yard was empty and he could not see who was
hammering."
"In the house on the left he saw some open windows; on the
window-sills were pots of sickly-looking geraniums."
"Linen was hung out
of the windows..."
He knew it all by heart.
"He turned away and sat down
on the sofa."
"Never, never had he felt himself so fearfully alone!"
"Yes, he felt once more that he would perhaps come to hate Sonia, now
that he had made her more miserable."
“Why had he gone to her to beg for her tears?
"What need had he to poison
her life?"
"Oh, the meanness of it!”

“I will remain alone,” he said resolutely, “and she shall not come to
the prison!”

Five minutes later he raised his head with a strange smile."
"That was a
strange thought."
"“Perhaps it really would be better in Siberia,” he thought suddenly."
"He could not have said how long he sat there with vague thoughts surging
through his mind."
All at once the door opened and Dounia came in.
"At
first she stood still and looked at him from the doorway, just as he
had done at Sonia; then she came in and sat down in the same place
as yesterday, on the chair facing him."
"He looked silently and almost
vacantly at her."
"“Don’t be angry, brother; I’ve only come for one minute,” said Dounia."
Her face looked thoughtful but not stern.
Her eyes were bright and soft.
He saw that she too had come to him with love.
"“Brother, now I know all, _all_."
"Dmitri Prokofitch has explained and
told me everything."
"They are worrying and persecuting you through a
stupid and contemptible suspicion.... Dmitri Prokofitch told me that
there is no danger, and that you are wrong in looking upon it with such
horror."
"I don’t think so, and I fully understand how indignant you must
be, and that that indignation may have a permanent effect on you."
"That’s
what I am afraid of."
"As for your cutting yourself off from us, I don’t
judge you, I don’t venture to judge you, and forgive me for having
blamed you for it."
"I feel that I too, if I had so great a trouble,
should keep away from everyone."
"I shall tell mother nothing _of this_,
but I shall talk about you continually and shall tell her from you that
you will come very soon."
"Don’t worry about her; _I_ will set her mind at
rest; but don’t you try her too much--come once at least; remember that
she is your mother."
"And now I have come simply to say” (Dounia began
to get up) “that if you should need me or should need... all my life or
anything... call me, and I’ll come."
"Good-bye!”

She turned abruptly and went towards the door."
“Dounia!” Raskolnikov stopped her and went towards her.
"“That Razumihin,
Dmitri Prokofitch, is a very good fellow.”

Dounia flushed slightly."
"“Well?” she asked, waiting a moment."
"“He is competent, hardworking, honest and capable of real love....
Good-bye, Dounia.”

Dounia flushed crimson, then suddenly she took alarm."
"“But what does it mean, brother?"
"Are we really parting for ever that
you... give me such a parting message?”

“Never mind.... Good-bye.”

He turned away, and walked to the window."
"She stood a moment, looked at
him uneasily, and went out troubled."
"No, he was not cold to her."
"There was an instant (the very last one)
when he had longed to take her in his arms and _say good-bye_ to her,
and even _to tell_ her, but he had not dared even to touch her hand."
"“Afterwards she may shudder when she remembers that I embraced her, and
will feel that I stole her kiss.”

“And would _she_ stand that test?” he went on a few minutes later to
himself."
"“No, she wouldn’t; girls like that can’t stand things!"
"They
never do.”

And he thought of Sonia."
There was a breath of fresh air from the window.
"The daylight was
fading."
He took up his cap and went out.
"He could not, of course, and would not consider how ill he was."
"But all
this continual anxiety and agony of mind could not but affect him."
"And
if he were not lying in high fever it was perhaps just because this
continual inner strain helped to keep him on his legs and in possession
of his faculties."
But this artificial excitement could not last long.
He wandered aimlessly.
The sun was setting.
"A special form of misery had
begun to oppress him of late."
"There was nothing poignant, nothing acute
about it; but there was a feeling of permanence, of eternity about it;
it brought a foretaste of hopeless years of this cold leaden misery, a
foretaste of an eternity “on a square yard of space.” Towards evening
this sensation usually began to weigh on him more heavily."
"“With this idiotic, purely physical weakness, depending on the sunset or
something, one can’t help doing something stupid!"
"You’ll go to Dounia,
as well as to Sonia,” he muttered bitterly."
He heard his name called.
He looked round.
"Lebeziatnikov rushed up to
him."
"“Only fancy, I’ve been to your room looking for you."
"Only fancy, she’s
carried out her plan, and taken away the children."
"Sofya Semyonovna and
I have had a job to find them."
"She is rapping on a frying-pan and making
the children dance."
The children are crying.
"They keep stopping at the
cross-roads and in front of shops; there’s a crowd of fools running
after them."
"Come along!”

“And Sonia?” Raskolnikov asked anxiously, hurrying after Lebeziatnikov."
“Simply frantic.
"That is, it’s not Sofya Semyonovna’s frantic, but
Katerina Ivanovna, though Sofya Semyonova’s frantic too."
"But Katerina
Ivanovna is absolutely frantic."
I tell you she is quite mad.
"They’ll be
taken to the police."
You can fancy what an effect that will have....
"They are on the canal bank, near the bridge now, not far from Sofya
Semyonovna’s, quite close.”

On the canal bank near the bridge and not two houses away from the one
where Sonia lodged, there was a crowd of people, consisting principally
of gutter children."
"The hoarse broken voice of Katerina Ivanovna could
be heard from the bridge, and it certainly was a strange spectacle
likely to attract a street crowd."
"Katerina Ivanovna in her old dress
with the green shawl, wearing a torn straw hat, crushed in a hideous way
on one side, was really frantic."
She was exhausted and breathless.
"Her
wasted consumptive face looked more suffering than ever, and indeed out
of doors in the sunshine a consumptive always looks worse than at home."
"But her excitement did not flag, and every moment her irritation grew
more intense."
"She rushed at the children, shouted at them, coaxed
them, told them before the crowd how to dance and what to sing, began
explaining to them why it was necessary, and driven to desperation by
their not understanding, beat them.... Then she would make a rush at the
crowd; if she noticed any decently dressed person stopping to look, she
immediately appealed to him to see what these children “from a genteel,
one may say aristocratic, house” had been brought to."
"If she heard
laughter or jeering in the crowd, she would rush at once at the scoffers
and begin squabbling with them."
"Some people laughed, others shook their
heads, but everyone felt curious at the sight of the madwoman with the
frightened children."
"The frying-pan of which Lebeziatnikov had spoken
was not there, at least Raskolnikov did not see it."
"But instead of
rapping on the pan, Katerina Ivanovna began clapping her wasted hands,
when she made Lida and Kolya dance and Polenka sing."
"She too joined in
the singing, but broke down at the second note with a fearful cough,
which made her curse in despair and even shed tears."
"What made her most
furious was the weeping and terror of Kolya and Lida."
"Some effort had
been made to dress the children up as street singers are dressed."
"The
boy had on a turban made of something red and white to look like a Turk."
"There had been no costume for Lida; she simply had a red knitted cap,
or rather a night cap that had belonged to Marmeladov, decorated with
a broken piece of white ostrich feather, which had been Katerina
Ivanovna’s grandmother’s and had been preserved as a family possession."
"Polenka was in her everyday dress; she looked in timid perplexity at her
mother, and kept at her side, hiding her tears."
"She dimly realised her
mother’s condition, and looked uneasily about her."
"She was terribly
frightened of the street and the crowd."
"Sonia followed Katerina
Ivanovna, weeping and beseeching her to return home, but Katerina
Ivanovna was not to be persuaded."
"“Leave off, Sonia, leave off,” she shouted, speaking fast, panting and
coughing."
“You don’t know what you ask; you are like a child!
"I’ve
told you before that I am not coming back to that drunken German."
"Let
everyone, let all Petersburg see the children begging in the streets,
though their father was an honourable man who served all his life in
truth and fidelity, and one may say died in the service.” (Katerina
Ivanovna had by now invented this fantastic story and thoroughly
believed it.)"
“Let that wretch of a general see it!
"And you are silly,
Sonia: what have we to eat?"
Tell me that.
"We have worried you enough, I
won’t go on so!"
"Ah, Rodion Romanovitch, is that you?” she cried, seeing
Raskolnikov and rushing up to him."
"“Explain to this silly girl, please,
that nothing better could be done!"
"Even organ-grinders earn their
living, and everyone will see at once that we are different, that we are
an honourable and bereaved family reduced to beggary."
"And that general
will lose his post, you’ll see!"
"We shall perform under his windows every
day, and if the Tsar drives by, I’ll fall on my knees, put the children
before me, show them to him, and say ‘Defend us father.’ He is the
father of the fatherless, he is merciful, he’ll protect us, you’ll
see, and that wretch of a general.... Lida, _tenez vous droite_!"
"Kolya,
you’ll dance again."
Why are you whimpering?
Whimpering again!
"What
are you afraid of, stupid?"
"Goodness, what am I to do with them, Rodion
Romanovitch?"
If you only knew how stupid they are!
"What’s one to do with
such children?”

And she, almost crying herself--which did not stop her uninterrupted,
rapid flow of talk--pointed to the crying children."
"Raskolnikov tried
to persuade her to go home, and even said, hoping to work on her vanity,
that it was unseemly for her to be wandering about the streets like
an organ-grinder, as she was intending to become the principal of a
boarding-school."
"“A boarding-school, ha-ha-ha!"
"A castle in the air,” cried Katerina
Ivanovna, her laugh ending in a cough."
"“No, Rodion Romanovitch, that
dream is over!"
All have forsaken us!...
"And that general.... You know,
Rodion Romanovitch, I threw an inkpot at him--it happened to be standing
in the waiting-room by the paper where you sign your name."
"I wrote my
name, threw it at him and ran away."
"Oh, the scoundrels, the scoundrels!"
"But enough of them, now I’ll provide for the children myself, I won’t
bow down to anybody!"
"She has had to bear enough for us!” she pointed
to Sonia."
"“Polenka, how much have you got?"
Show me!
"What, only two
farthings!"
"Oh, the mean wretches!"
"They give us nothing, only run after
us, putting their tongues out."
"There, what is that blockhead laughing
at?” (She pointed to a man in the crowd.)"
"“It’s all because Kolya here
is so stupid; I have such a bother with him."
"What do you want, Polenka?"
"Tell me in French, _parlez-moi français_."
"Why, I’ve taught you, you know
some phrases."
"Else how are you to show that you are of good family, well
brought-up children, and not at all like other organ-grinders?"
"We aren’t
going to have a Punch and Judy show in the street, but to sing a genteel
song.... Ah, yes,... What are we to sing?"
"You keep putting me out,
but we... you see, we are standing here, Rodion Romanovitch, to find
something to sing and get money, something Kolya can dance to.... For,
as you can fancy, our performance is all impromptu.... We must talk it
over and rehearse it all thoroughly, and then we shall go to Nevsky,
where there are far more people of good society, and we shall be noticed
at once."
"Lida knows ‘My Village’ only, nothing but ‘My Village,’ and
everyone sings that."
"We must sing something far more genteel.... Well,
have you thought of anything, Polenka?"
If only you’d help your mother!
"My memory’s quite gone, or I should have thought of something."
"We really
can’t sing ‘An Hussar.’ Ah, let us sing in French, ‘Cinq sous,’ I have
taught it you, I have taught it you."
"And as it is in French, people will
see at once that you are children of good family, and that will be much
more touching.... You might sing ‘Marlborough s’en va-t-en guerre,’
for that’s quite a child’s song and is sung as a lullaby in all the
aristocratic houses."
"“_Marlborough s’en va-t-en guerre Ne sait quand reviendra_...”
 she began singing."
"“But no, better sing ‘Cinq sous.’ Now, Kolya, your
hands on your hips, make haste, and you, Lida, keep turning the other
way, and Polenka and I will sing and clap our hands!"
"“_Cinq sous, cinq sous Pour monter notre menage_.”

(Cough-cough-cough!)"
"“Set your dress straight, Polenka, it’s slipped
down on your shoulders,” she observed, panting from coughing."
"“Now it’s
particularly necessary to behave nicely and genteelly, that all may
see that you are well-born children."
"I said at the time that the bodice
should be cut longer, and made of two widths."
"It was your fault, Sonia,
with your advice to make it shorter, and now you see the child is quite
deformed by it.... Why, you’re all crying again!"
"What’s the matter,
stupids?"
"Come, Kolya, begin."
"Make haste, make haste!"
"Oh, what an
unbearable child!"
"“Cinq sous, cinq sous."
“A policeman again!
"What do you want?”

A policeman was indeed forcing his way through the crowd."
"But at that
moment a gentleman in civilian uniform and an overcoat--a solid-looking
official of about fifty with a decoration on his neck (which delighted
Katerina Ivanovna and had its effect on the policeman)--approached and
without a word handed her a green three-rouble note."
"His face wore
a look of genuine sympathy."
"Katerina Ivanovna took it and gave him a
polite, even ceremonious, bow."
"“I thank you, honoured sir,” she began loftily."
"“The causes that have
induced us (take the money, Polenka: you see there are generous and
honourable people who are ready to help a poor gentlewoman in distress)."
"You see, honoured sir, these orphans of good family--I might even say of
aristocratic connections--and that wretch of a general sat eating
grouse... and stamped at my disturbing him."
"‘Your excellency,’ I said,
‘protect the orphans, for you knew my late husband, Semyon Zaharovitch,
and on the very day of his death the basest of scoundrels slandered his
only daughter.’... That policeman again!"
"Protect me,” she cried to the
official."
“Why is that policeman edging up to me?
"We have only just run
away from one of them."
"What do you want, fool?”

“It’s forbidden in the streets."
"You mustn’t make a disturbance.”

“It’s you’re making a disturbance."
"It’s just the same as if I were
grinding an organ."
"What business is it of yours?”

“You have to get a licence for an organ, and you haven’t got one, and in
that way you collect a crowd."
"Where do you lodge?”

“What, a license?” wailed Katerina Ivanovna."
"“I buried my husband
to-day."
"What need of a license?”

“Calm yourself, madam, calm yourself,” began the official."
"“Come along;
I will escort you...."
This is no place for you in the crowd.
"You are
ill.”

“Honoured sir, honoured sir, you don’t know,” screamed Katerina
Ivanovna."
"“We are going to the Nevsky.... Sonia, Sonia!"
Where is she?
She is crying too!
What’s the matter with you all?
"Kolya, Lida, where
are you going?” she cried suddenly in alarm."
"“Oh, silly children!"
"Kolya,
Lida, where are they off to?...”

Kolya and Lida, scared out of their wits by the crowd, and their
mother’s mad pranks, suddenly seized each other by the hand, and ran off
at the sight of the policeman who wanted to take them away somewhere."
"Weeping and wailing, poor Katerina Ivanovna ran after them."
"She was
a piteous and unseemly spectacle, as she ran, weeping and panting for
breath."
Sonia and Polenka rushed after them.
"“Bring them back, bring them back, Sonia!"
"Oh stupid, ungrateful
children!..."
Polenka!
"catch them.... It’s for your sakes I...”

She stumbled as she ran and fell down."
"“She’s cut herself, she’s bleeding!"
"Oh, dear!” cried Sonia, bending over
her."
All ran up and crowded around.
"Raskolnikov and Lebeziatnikov were the
first at her side, the official too hastened up, and behind him the
policeman who muttered, “Bother!” with a gesture of impatience, feeling
that the job was going to be a troublesome one."
“Pass on!
Pass on!” he said to the crowd that pressed forward.
"“She’s dying,” someone shouted."
"“She’s gone out of her mind,” said another."
"“Lord have mercy upon us,” said a woman, crossing herself."
"“Have they
caught the little girl and the boy?"
"They’re being brought back, the
elder one’s got them.... Ah, the naughty imps!”

When they examined Katerina Ivanovna carefully, they saw that she had
not cut herself against a stone, as Sonia thought, but that the blood
that stained the pavement red was from her chest."
"“I’ve seen that before,” muttered the official to Raskolnikov and
Lebeziatnikov; “that’s consumption; the blood flows and chokes the
patient."
"I saw the same thing with a relative of my own not long ago...
nearly a pint of blood, all in a minute.... What’s to be done though?"
"She is dying.”

“This way, this way, to my room!” Sonia implored."
“I live here!...
"See,
that house, the second from here.... Come to me, make haste,” she turned
from one to the other."
“Send for the doctor!
"Oh, dear!”

Thanks to the official’s efforts, this plan was adopted, the policeman
even helping to carry Katerina Ivanovna."
"She was carried to Sonia’s
room, almost unconscious, and laid on the bed."
"The blood was still
flowing, but she seemed to be coming to herself."
"Raskolnikov,
Lebeziatnikov, and the official accompanied Sonia into the room and were
followed by the policeman, who first drove back the crowd which followed
to the very door."
"Polenka came in holding Kolya and Lida, who
were trembling and weeping."
"Several persons came in too from the
Kapernaumovs’ room; the landlord, a lame one-eyed man of strange
appearance with whiskers and hair that stood up like a brush, his
wife, a woman with an everlastingly scared expression, and several
open-mouthed children with wonder-struck faces."
"Among these,
Svidrigaïlov suddenly made his appearance."
"Raskolnikov looked at him
with surprise, not understanding where he had come from and not having
noticed him in the crowd."
A doctor and priest wore spoken of.
"The
official whispered to Raskolnikov that he thought it was too late now
for the doctor, but he ordered him to be sent for."
"Kapernaumov ran
himself."
Meanwhile Katerina Ivanovna had regained her breath.
"The bleeding ceased
for a time."
"She looked with sick but intent and penetrating eyes at
Sonia, who stood pale and trembling, wiping the sweat from her brow with
a handkerchief."
At last she asked to be raised.
"They sat her up on the
bed, supporting her on both sides."
“Where are the children?” she said in a faint voice.
"“You’ve brought
them, Polenka?"
Oh the sillies!
"Why did you run away.... Och!”

Once more her parched lips were covered with blood."
"She moved her eyes,
looking about her."
"“So that’s how you live, Sonia!"
"Never once have I been in your room.”

She looked at her with a face of suffering."
"“We have been your ruin, Sonia."
"Polenka, Lida, Kolya, come here!"
"Well,
here they are, Sonia, take them all!"
"I hand them over to you, I’ve had
enough!"
The ball is over.” (Cough!)
"“Lay me down, let me die in peace.”

They laid her back on the pillow."
"“What, the priest?"
I don’t want him.
You haven’t got a rouble to spare.
I have no sins.
God must forgive me without that.
"He knows how I have
suffered.... And if He won’t forgive me, I don’t care!”

She sank more and more into uneasy delirium."
"At times she shuddered,
turned her eyes from side to side, recognised everyone for a minute,
but at once sank into delirium again."
"Her breathing was hoarse and
difficult, there was a sort of rattle in her throat."
"“I said to him, your excellency,” she ejaculated, gasping after each
word."
"“That Amalia Ludwigovna, ah!"
"Lida, Kolya, hands on your hips,
make haste!"
"_Glissez, glissez!"
"pas de basque!_ Tap with your heels, be a
graceful child!"
"“_Du hast Diamanten und Perlen_

“What next?"
That’s the thing to sing.
"“_Du hast die schönsten Augen Mädchen, was willst du mehr?_

“What an idea!"
_Was willst du mehr?_ What things the fool invents!
"Ah,
yes!"
“In the heat of midday in the vale of Dagestan.
"“Ah, how I loved it!"
"I loved that song to distraction, Polenka!"
"Your
father, you know, used to sing it when we were engaged.... Oh those
days!"
Oh that’s the thing for us to sing!
How does it go?
"I’ve
forgotten."
Remind me!
"How was it?”

She was violently excited and tried to sit up."
"At last, in a horribly
hoarse, broken voice, she began, shrieking and gasping at every word,
with a look of growing terror."
“In the heat of midday!...
in the vale!...
of Dagestan!...
"With lead in
my breast!...”

“Your excellency!” she wailed suddenly with a heart-rending scream and
a flood of tears, “protect the orphans!"
"You have been their father’s
guest... one may say aristocratic....” She started, regaining
consciousness, and gazed at all with a sort of terror, but at once
recognised Sonia."
"“Sonia, Sonia!” she articulated softly and caressingly, as though
surprised to find her there."
"“Sonia darling, are you here, too?”

They lifted her up again."
“Enough!
It’s over!
"Farewell, poor thing!"
I am done for!
"I am broken!”
 she cried with vindictive despair, and her head fell heavily back on the
pillow."
"She sank into unconsciousness again, but this time it did not last long."
"Her pale, yellow, wasted face dropped back, her mouth fell open, her leg
moved convulsively, she gave a deep, deep sigh and died."
"Sonia fell upon her, flung her arms about her, and remained motionless
with her head pressed to the dead woman’s wasted bosom."
"Polenka threw
herself at her mother’s feet, kissing them and weeping violently."
"Though
Kolya and Lida did not understand what had happened, they had a feeling
that it was something terrible; they put their hands on each other’s
little shoulders, stared straight at one another and both at once opened
their mouths and began screaming."
"They were both still in their fancy
dress; one in a turban, the other in the cap with the ostrich feather."
"And how did “the certificate of merit” come to be on the bed beside
Katerina Ivanovna?"
It lay there by the pillow; Raskolnikov saw it.
He walked away to the window.
Lebeziatnikov skipped up to him.
"“She is dead,” he said."
"“Rodion Romanovitch, I must have two words with you,” said Svidrigaïlov,
coming up to them."
Lebeziatnikov at once made room for him and delicately withdrew.
Svidrigaïlov drew Raskolnikov further away.
"“I will undertake all the arrangements, the funeral and that."
"You know
it’s a question of money and, as I told you, I have plenty to spare."
"I
will put those two little ones and Polenka into some good orphan asylum,
and I will settle fifteen hundred roubles to be paid to each on coming
of age, so that Sofya Semyonovna need have no anxiety about them."
"And I
will pull her out of the mud too, for she is a good girl, isn’t she?"
"So
tell Avdotya Romanovna that that is how I am spending her ten thousand.”

“What is your motive for such benevolence?” asked Raskolnikov."
“Ah!
you sceptical person!” laughed Svidrigaïlov.
"“I told you I had no
need of that money."
Won’t you admit that it’s simply done from humanity?
"She wasn’t ‘a louse,’ you know” (he pointed to the corner where the
dead woman lay), “was she, like some old pawnbroker woman?"
"Come, you’ll
agree, is Luzhin to go on living, and doing wicked things or is she to
die?"
"And if I didn’t help them, Polenka would go the same way.”

He said this with an air of a sort of gay winking slyness, keeping his
eyes fixed on Raskolnikov, who turned white and cold, hearing his own
phrases, spoken to Sonia."
"He quickly stepped back and looked wildly at
Svidrigaïlov."
"“How do you know?” he whispered, hardly able to breathe."
"“Why, I lodge here at Madame Resslich’s, the other side of the wall."
"Here is Kapernaumov, and there lives Madame Resslich, an old and devoted
friend of mine."
"I am a neighbour.”

“You?”

“Yes,” continued Svidrigaïlov, shaking with laughter."
"“I assure you
on my honour, dear Rodion Romanovitch, that you have interested me
enormously."
"I told you we should become friends, I foretold it."
"Well,
here we have."
And you will see what an accommodating person I am.
"You’ll
see that you can get on with me!”




PART VI



CHAPTER I

A strange period began for Raskolnikov: it was as though a fog had
fallen upon him and wrapped him in a dreary solitude from which there
was no escape."
"Recalling that period long after, he believed that his
mind had been clouded at times, and that it had continued so, with
intervals, till the final catastrophe."
"He was convinced that he had been
mistaken about many things at that time, for instance as to the date
of certain events."
"Anyway, when he tried later on to piece his
recollections together, he learnt a great deal about himself from what
other people told him."
"He had mixed up incidents and had explained
events as due to circumstances which existed only in his imagination."
"At
times he was a prey to agonies of morbid uneasiness, amounting sometimes
to panic."
"But he remembered, too, moments, hours, perhaps whole days,
of complete apathy, which came upon him as a reaction from his previous
terror and might be compared with the abnormal insensibility, sometimes
seen in the dying."
"He seemed to be trying in that latter stage to escape
from a full and clear understanding of his position."
"Certain essential
facts which required immediate consideration were particularly irksome
to him."
"How glad he would have been to be free from some cares, the
neglect of which would have threatened him with complete, inevitable
ruin."
"He was particularly worried about Svidrigaïlov, he might be said to be
permanently thinking of Svidrigaïlov."
"From the time of Svidrigaïlov’s
too menacing and unmistakable words in Sonia’s room at the moment of
Katerina Ivanovna’s death, the normal working of his mind seemed to
break down."
"But although this new fact caused him extreme uneasiness,
Raskolnikov was in no hurry for an explanation of it."
"At times, finding
himself in a solitary and remote part of the town, in some wretched
eating-house, sitting alone lost in thought, hardly knowing how he had
come there, he suddenly thought of Svidrigaïlov."
"He recognised
suddenly, clearly, and with dismay that he ought at once to come to an
understanding with that man and to make what terms he could."
"Walking
outside the city gates one day, he positively fancied that they had
fixed a meeting there, that he was waiting for Svidrigaïlov."
"Another
time he woke up before daybreak lying on the ground under some bushes
and could not at first understand how he had come there."
"But during the two or three days after Katerina Ivanovna’s death, he
had two or three times met Svidrigaïlov at Sonia’s lodging, where he
had gone aimlessly for a moment."
"They exchanged a few words and made no
reference to the vital subject, as though they were tacitly agreed not
to speak of it for a time."
"Katerina Ivanovna’s body was still lying in the coffin, Svidrigaïlov was
busy making arrangements for the funeral."
Sonia too was very busy.
"At
their last meeting Svidrigaïlov informed Raskolnikov that he had made
an arrangement, and a very satisfactory one, for Katerina Ivanovna’s
children; that he had, through certain connections, succeeded in getting
hold of certain personages by whose help the three orphans could be at
once placed in very suitable institutions; that the money he had settled
on them had been of great assistance, as it is much easier to place
orphans with some property than destitute ones."
"He said something
too about Sonia and promised to come himself in a day or two to see
Raskolnikov, mentioning that “he would like to consult with him, that
there were things they must talk over....”

This conversation took place in the passage on the stairs."
"Svidrigaïlov
looked intently at Raskolnikov and suddenly, after a brief pause,
dropping his voice, asked: “But how is it, Rodion Romanovitch; you
don’t seem yourself?"
"You look and you listen, but you don’t seem to
understand."
Cheer up!
"We’ll talk things over; I am only sorry, I’ve
so much to do of my own business and other people’s."
"Ah, Rodion
Romanovitch,” he added suddenly, “what all men need is fresh air, fresh
air... more than anything!”

He moved to one side to make way for the priest and server, who
were coming up the stairs."
They had come for the requiem service.
"By
Svidrigaïlov’s orders it was sung twice a day punctually."
"Svidrigaïlov
went his way."
"Raskolnikov stood still a moment, thought, and followed
the priest into Sonia’s room."
He stood at the door.
"They began quietly,
slowly and mournfully singing the service."
"From his childhood the
thought of death and the presence of death had something oppressive
and mysteriously awful; and it was long since he had heard the requiem
service."
"And there was something else here as well, too awful and
disturbing."
"He looked at the children: they were all kneeling by the
coffin; Polenka was weeping."
"Behind them Sonia prayed, softly and, as it
were, timidly weeping."
"“These last two days she hasn’t said a word to me, she hasn’t glanced at
me,” Raskolnikov thought suddenly."
"The sunlight was bright in the room;
the incense rose in clouds; the priest read, “Give rest, oh Lord....”
 Raskolnikov stayed all through the service."
"As he blessed them and
took his leave, the priest looked round strangely."
"After the service,
Raskolnikov went up to Sonia."
"She took both his hands and let her
head sink on his shoulder."
"This slight friendly gesture bewildered
Raskolnikov."
"It seemed strange to him that there was no trace of
repugnance, no trace of disgust, no tremor in her hand."
"It was the
furthest limit of self-abnegation, at least so he interpreted it."
Sonia said nothing.
Raskolnikov pressed her hand and went out.
"He felt
very miserable."
"If it had been possible to escape to some solitude, he
would have thought himself lucky, even if he had to spend his whole life
there."
"But although he had almost always been by himself of late, he had
never been able to feel alone."
"Sometimes he walked out of the town on to
the high road, once he had even reached a little wood, but the lonelier
the place was, the more he seemed to be aware of an uneasy presence near
him."
"It did not frighten him, but greatly annoyed him, so that he
made haste to return to the town, to mingle with the crowd, to enter
restaurants and taverns, to walk in busy thoroughfares."
"There he felt
easier and even more solitary."
"One day at dusk he sat for an hour
listening to songs in a tavern and he remembered that he positively
enjoyed it."
"But at last he had suddenly felt the same uneasiness again,
as though his conscience smote him."
"“Here I sit listening to singing,
is that what I ought to be doing?” he thought."
"Yet he felt at once
that that was not the only cause of his uneasiness; there was something
requiring immediate decision, but it was something he could not clearly
understand or put into words."
It was a hopeless tangle.
"“No, better the
struggle again!"
Better Porfiry again... or Svidrigaïlov....
"Better some
challenge again... some attack."
"Yes, yes!” he thought."
"He went out of
the tavern and rushed away almost at a run."
"The thought of Dounia and
his mother suddenly reduced him almost to a panic."
"That night he woke
up before morning among some bushes in Krestovsky Island, trembling
all over with fever; he walked home, and it was early morning when he
arrived."
"After some hours’ sleep the fever left him, but he woke up
late, two o’clock in the afternoon."
"He remembered that Katerina Ivanovna’s funeral had been fixed for that
day, and was glad that he was not present at it."
"Nastasya brought him
some food; he ate and drank with appetite, almost with greediness."
"His
head was fresher and he was calmer than he had been for the last three
days."
He even felt a passing wonder at his previous attacks of panic.
The door opened and Razumihin came in.
"“Ah, he’s eating, then he’s not ill,” said Razumihin."
"He took a chair
and sat down at the table opposite Raskolnikov."
He was troubled and did not attempt to conceal it.
"He spoke with evident
annoyance, but without hurry or raising his voice."
"He looked as though
he had some special fixed determination."
"“Listen,” he began resolutely."
"“As far as I am concerned, you may all go
to hell, but from what I see, it’s clear to me that I can’t make head or
tail of it; please don’t think I’ve come to ask you questions."
"I don’t
want to know, hang it!"
"If you begin telling me your secrets, I dare say
I shouldn’t stay to listen, I should go away cursing."
"I have only come
to find out once for all whether it’s a fact that you are mad?"
"There is
a conviction in the air that you are mad or very nearly so."
"I admit
I’ve been disposed to that opinion myself, judging from your stupid,
repulsive and quite inexplicable actions, and from your recent behavior
to your mother and sister."
"Only a monster or a madman could treat them
as you have; so you must be mad.”

“When did you see them last?”

“Just now."
Haven’t you seen them since then?
"What have you been doing
with yourself?"
"Tell me, please."
I’ve been to you three times already.
Your mother has been seriously ill since yesterday.
"She had made up
her mind to come to you; Avdotya Romanovna tried to prevent her; she
wouldn’t hear a word."
"‘If he is ill, if his mind is giving way, who can
look after him like his mother?’ she said."
"We all came here together, we
couldn’t let her come alone all the way."
We kept begging her to be calm.
"We came in, you weren’t here; she sat down, and stayed ten minutes,
while we stood waiting in silence."
"She got up and said: ‘If he’s
gone out, that is, if he is well, and has forgotten his mother, it’s
humiliating and unseemly for his mother to stand at his door begging for
kindness.’ She returned home and took to her bed; now she is in a fever."
"‘I see,’ she said, ‘that he has time for _his girl_.’ She means by _your
girl_ Sofya Semyonovna, your betrothed or your mistress, I don’t know."
"I
went at once to Sofya Semyonovna’s, for I wanted to know what was going
on."
"I looked round, I saw the coffin, the children crying, and
Sofya Semyonovna trying them on mourning dresses."
No sign of you.
"I
apologised, came away, and reported to Avdotya Romanovna."
"So that’s all
nonsense and you haven’t got a girl; the most likely thing is that you
are mad."
"But here you sit, guzzling boiled beef as though you’d not had
a bite for three days."
"Though as far as that goes, madmen eat too, but
though you have not said a word to me yet... you are not mad!"
"That I’d
swear!"
"Above all, you are not mad!"
"So you may go to hell, all of you,
for there’s some mystery, some secret about it, and I don’t intend to
worry my brains over your secrets."
"So I’ve simply come to swear at you,”
 he finished, getting up, “to relieve my mind."
"And I know what to do
now.”

“What do you mean to do now?”

“What business is it of yours what I mean to do?”

“You are going in for a drinking bout.”

“How... how did you know?”

“Why, it’s pretty plain.”

Razumihin paused for a minute."
"“You always have been a very rational person and you’ve never been mad,
never,” he observed suddenly with warmth."
“You’re right: I shall drink.
"Good-bye!”

And he moved to go out."
"“I was talking with my sister--the day before yesterday, I think it
was--about you, Razumihin.”

“About me!"
"But... where can you have seen her the day before yesterday?”
 Razumihin stopped short and even turned a little pale."
One could see that his heart was throbbing slowly and violently.
"“She came here by herself, sat there and talked to me.”

“She did!”

“Yes.”

“What did you say to her..."
"I mean, about me?”

“I told her you were a very good, honest, and industrious man."
"I didn’t
tell her you love her, because she knows that herself.”

“She knows that herself?”

“Well, it’s pretty plain."
"Wherever I might go, whatever happened to me,
you would remain to look after them."
"I, so to speak, give them into your
keeping, Razumihin."
"I say this because I know quite well how you love
her, and am convinced of the purity of your heart."
"I know that she too
may love you and perhaps does love you already."
"Now decide for yourself,
as you know best, whether you need go in for a drinking bout or not.”

“Rodya!"
"You see... well.... Ach, damn it!"
But where do you mean to go?
"Of course, if it’s all a secret, never mind...."
But I...
"I shall find
out the secret... and I am sure that it must be some ridiculous nonsense
and that you’ve made it all up."
"Anyway you are a capital fellow, a
capital fellow!...”

“That was just what I wanted to add, only you interrupted, that that was
a very good decision of yours not to find out these secrets."
"Leave it to
time, don’t worry about it."
You’ll know it all in time when it must be.
"Yesterday a man said to me that what a man needs is fresh air, fresh
air, fresh air."
"I mean to go to him directly to find out what he meant
by that.”

Razumihin stood lost in thought and excitement, making a silent
conclusion."
“He’s a political conspirator!
He must be.
"And he’s on the eve of some
desperate step, that’s certain."
It can only be that!
"And... and Dounia
knows,” he thought suddenly."
"“So Avdotya Romanovna comes to see you,” he said, weighing each
syllable, “and you’re going to see a man who says we need more air, and
so of course that letter... that too must have something to do with it,”
 he concluded to himself."
"“What letter?”

“She got a letter to-day."
It upset her very much--very much indeed.
"Too
much so."
"I began speaking of you, she begged me not to."
"Then... then
she said that perhaps we should very soon have to part... then she began
warmly thanking me for something; then she went to her room and locked
herself in.”

“She got a letter?” Raskolnikov asked thoughtfully."
"“Yes, and you didn’t know?"
"hm...”

They were both silent."
"“Good-bye, Rodion."
"There was a time, brother, when I.... Never mind,
good-bye."
"You see, there was a time.... Well, good-bye!"
"I must be off
too."
I am not going to drink.
"There’s no need now.... That’s all stuff!”

He hurried out; but when he had almost closed the door behind him, he
suddenly opened it again, and said, looking away:

“Oh, by the way, do you remember that murder, you know Porfiry’s, that
old woman?"
"Do you know the murderer has been found, he has confessed
and given the proofs."
"It’s one of those very workmen, the painter, only
fancy!"
Do you remember I defended them here?
"Would you believe it, all
that scene of fighting and laughing with his companions on the stairs
while the porter and the two witnesses were going up, he got up on
purpose to disarm suspicion."
"The cunning, the presence of mind of the
young dog!"
"One can hardly credit it; but it’s his own explanation, he
has confessed it all."
And what a fool I was about it!
"Well, he’s simply
a genius of hypocrisy and resourcefulness in disarming the suspicions of
the lawyers--so there’s nothing much to wonder at, I suppose!"
"Of course
people like that are always possible."
"And the fact that he couldn’t keep
up the character, but confessed, makes him easier to believe in."
"But
what a fool I was!"
"I was frantic on their side!”

“Tell me, please, from whom did you hear that, and why does it interest
you so?” Raskolnikov asked with unmistakable agitation."
“What next?
You ask me why it interests me!...
"Well, I heard it from
Porfiry, among others..."
"It was from him I heard almost all about it.”

“From Porfiry?”

“From Porfiry.”

“What... what did he say?” Raskolnikov asked in dismay."
“He gave me a capital explanation of it.
"Psychologically, after his
fashion.”

“He explained it?"
"Explained it himself?”

“Yes, yes; good-bye."
"I’ll tell you all about it another time, but now
I’m busy."
There was a time when I fancied...
"But no matter, another
time!..."
What need is there for me to drink now?
"You have made me drunk
without wine."
"I am drunk, Rodya!"
"Good-bye, I’m going."
"I’ll come again
very soon.”

He went out."
"“He’s a political conspirator, there’s not a doubt about it,” Razumihin
decided, as he slowly descended the stairs."
"“And he’s drawn his sister
in; that’s quite, quite in keeping with Avdotya Romanovna’s character."
There are interviews between them!...
She hinted at it too...
"So many of
her words.... and hints... bear that meaning!"
"And how else can all this
tangle be explained?"
Hm!
"And I was almost thinking... Good heavens,
what I thought!"
"Yes, I took leave of my senses and I wronged him!"
"It was
his doing, under the lamp in the corridor that day."
Pfoo!
"What a crude,
nasty, vile idea on my part!"
"Nikolay is a brick, for confessing.... And
how clear it all is now!"
"His illness then, all his strange actions...
before this, in the university, how morose he used to be, how gloomy...."
But what’s the meaning now of that letter?
"There’s something in that,
too, perhaps."
Whom was it from?
I suspect...!
"No, I must find out!”

He thought of Dounia, realising all he had heard and his heart throbbed,
and he suddenly broke into a run."
"As soon as Razumihin went out, Raskolnikov got up, turned to the window,
walked into one corner and then into another, as though forgetting the
smallness of his room, and sat down again on the sofa."
"He felt, so to
speak, renewed; again the struggle, so a means of escape had come."
"“Yes, a means of escape had come!"
"It had been too stifling, too
cramping, the burden had been too agonising."
"A lethargy had come upon
him at times."
"From the moment of the scene with Nikolay at Porfiry’s he
had been suffocating, penned in without hope of escape."
"After Nikolay’s
confession, on that very day had come the scene with Sonia; his
behaviour and his last words had been utterly unlike anything he
could have imagined beforehand; he had grown feebler, instantly and
fundamentally!"
"And he had agreed at the time with Sonia, he had agreed
in his heart he could not go on living alone with such a thing on his
mind!"
“And Svidrigaïlov was a riddle...
"He worried him, that was true, but
somehow not on the same point."
"He might still have a struggle to come
with Svidrigaïlov."
"Svidrigaïlov, too, might be a means of escape; but
Porfiry was a different matter."
"“And so Porfiry himself had explained it to Razumihin, had explained it
_psychologically_."
He had begun bringing in his damned psychology again!
Porfiry?
"But to think that Porfiry should for one moment believe that
Nikolay was guilty, after what had passed between them before Nikolay’s
appearance, after that tête-à-tête interview, which could have only
_one_ explanation?"
"(During those days Raskolnikov had often recalled
passages in that scene with Porfiry; he could not bear to let his mind
rest on it.)"
"Such words, such gestures had passed between them, they
had exchanged such glances, things had been said in such a tone and had
reached such a pass, that Nikolay, whom Porfiry had seen through at the
first word, at the first gesture, could not have shaken his conviction."
“And to think that even Razumihin had begun to suspect!
"The scene in the
corridor under the lamp had produced its effect then."
"He had rushed to
Porfiry...."
But what had induced the latter to receive him like that?
What had been his object in putting Razumihin off with Nikolay?
"He must
have some plan; there was some design, but what was it?"
"It was true that
a long time had passed since that morning--too long a time--and no sight
nor sound of Porfiry."
"Well, that was a bad sign....”

Raskolnikov took his cap and went out of the room, still pondering."
"It
was the first time for a long while that he had felt clear in his mind,
at least."
"“I must settle Svidrigaïlov,” he thought, “and as soon as
possible; he, too, seems to be waiting for me to come to him of my own
accord.” And at that moment there was such a rush of hate in his
weary heart that he might have killed either of those two--Porfiry or
Svidrigaïlov."
"At least he felt that he would be capable of doing it
later, if not now."
"“We shall see, we shall see,” he repeated to himself."
"But no sooner had he opened the door than he stumbled upon Porfiry
himself in the passage."
He was coming in to see him.
"Raskolnikov was
dumbfounded for a minute, but only for one minute."
"Strange to say, he
was not very much astonished at seeing Porfiry and scarcely afraid of
him."
"He was simply startled, but was quickly, instantly, on his guard."
“Perhaps this will mean the end?
"But how could Porfiry have approached
so quietly, like a cat, so that he had heard nothing?"
"Could he have been
listening at the door?”

“You didn’t expect a visitor, Rodion Romanovitch,” Porfiry explained,
laughing."
"“I’ve been meaning to look in a long time; I was passing by
and thought why not go in for five minutes."
Are you going out?
"I won’t
keep you long."
"Just let me have one cigarette.”

“Sit down, Porfiry Petrovitch, sit down.” Raskolnikov gave his visitor
a seat with so pleased and friendly an expression that he would have
marvelled at himself, if he could have seen it."
"The last moment had come, the last drops had to be drained!"
"So a man
will sometimes go through half an hour of mortal terror with a brigand,
yet when the knife is at his throat at last, he feels no fear."
"Raskolnikov seated himself directly facing Porfiry, and looked at him
without flinching."
"Porfiry screwed up his eyes and began lighting a
cigarette."
"“Speak, speak,” seemed as though it would burst from Raskolnikov’s
heart."
"“Come, why don’t you speak?”



CHAPTER II

“Ah these cigarettes!” Porfiry Petrovitch ejaculated at last, having
lighted one."
"“They are pernicious, positively pernicious, and yet I
can’t give them up!"
"I cough, I begin to have tickling in my throat and
a difficulty in breathing."
"You know I am a coward, I went lately to
Dr. B----n; he always gives at least half an hour to each patient."
"He
positively laughed looking at me; he sounded me: ‘Tobacco’s bad for
you,’ he said, ‘your lungs are affected.’ But how am I to give it up?"
What is there to take its place?
"I don’t drink, that’s the mischief,
he-he-he, that I don’t."
"Everything is relative, Rodion Romanovitch,
everything is relative!”

“Why, he’s playing his professional tricks again,” Raskolnikov thought
with disgust."
"All the circumstances of their last interview suddenly
came back to him, and he felt a rush of the feeling that had come upon
him then."
"“I came to see you the day before yesterday, in the evening; you didn’t
know?” Porfiry Petrovitch went on, looking round the room."
"“I came into
this very room."
"I was passing by, just as I did to-day, and I thought
I’d return your call."
"I walked in as your door was wide open, I looked
round, waited and went out without leaving my name with your servant."
"Don’t you lock your door?”

Raskolnikov’s face grew more and more gloomy."
"Porfiry seemed to guess
his state of mind."
"“I’ve come to have it out with you, Rodion Romanovitch, my dear fellow!"
"I owe you an explanation and must give it to you,” he continued with a
slight smile, just patting Raskolnikov’s knee."
"But almost at the same instant a serious and careworn look came into his
face; to his surprise Raskolnikov saw a touch of sadness in it."
"He had
never seen and never suspected such an expression in his face."
"“A strange scene passed between us last time we met, Rodion Romanovitch."
"Our first interview, too, was a strange one; but then... and one thing
after another!"
"This is the point: I have perhaps acted unfairly to you;
I feel it."
Do you remember how we parted?
"Your nerves were unhinged and
your knees were shaking and so were mine."
"And, you know, our behaviour
was unseemly, even ungentlemanly."
"And yet we are gentlemen, above all,
in any case, gentlemen; that must be understood."
"Do you remember what we
came to?..."
"and it was quite indecorous.”

“What is he up to, what does he take me for?” Raskolnikov asked himself
in amazement, raising his head and looking with open eyes on Porfiry."
"“I’ve decided openness is better between us,” Porfiry Petrovitch went
on, turning his head away and dropping his eyes, as though unwilling to
disconcert his former victim and as though disdaining his former wiles."
"“Yes, such suspicions and such scenes cannot continue for long."
"Nikolay
put a stop to it, or I don’t know what we might not have come to."
"That
damned workman was sitting at the time in the next room--can you realise
that?"
"You know that, of course; and I am aware that he came to you
afterwards."
"But what you supposed then was not true: I had not sent for
anyone, I had made no kind of arrangements."
You ask why I hadn’t?
"What
shall I say to you?"
it had all come upon me so suddenly.
"I had scarcely
sent for the porters (you noticed them as you went out, I dare say)."
"An idea flashed upon me; I was firmly convinced at the time, you see,
Rodion Romanovitch."
"Come, I thought--even if I let one thing slip for
a time, I shall get hold of something else--I shan’t lose what I want,
anyway."
"You are nervously irritable, Rodion Romanovitch, by temperament;
it’s out of proportion with other qualities of your heart and character,
which I flatter myself I have to some extent divined."
"Of course I did
reflect even then that it does not always happen that a man gets up and
blurts out his whole story."
"It does happen sometimes, if you make a
man lose all patience, though even then it’s rare."
"I was capable of
realising that."
"If I only had a fact, I thought, the least little fact
to go upon, something I could lay hold of, something tangible, not
merely psychological."
"For if a man is guilty, you must be able to get
something substantial out of him; one may reckon upon most surprising
results indeed."
"I was reckoning on your temperament, Rodion Romanovitch,
on your temperament above all things!"
"I had great hopes of you at that
time.”

“But what are you driving at now?” Raskolnikov muttered at last, asking
the question without thinking."
"“What is he talking about?” he wondered distractedly, “does he really
take me to be innocent?”

“What am I driving at?"
"I’ve come to explain myself, I consider it my
duty, so to speak."
"I want to make clear to you how the whole business,
the whole misunderstanding arose."
"I’ve caused you a great deal of
suffering, Rodion Romanovitch."
I am not a monster.
"I understand what
it must mean for a man who has been unfortunate, but who is proud,
imperious and above all, impatient, to have to bear such treatment!"
"I regard you in any case as a man of noble character and not without
elements of magnanimity, though I don’t agree with all your convictions."
"I wanted to tell you this first, frankly and quite sincerely, for above
all I don’t want to deceive you."
"When I made your acquaintance, I felt
attracted by you."
Perhaps you will laugh at my saying so.
"You have a
right to."
"I know you disliked me from the first and indeed you’ve no
reason to like me."
"You may think what you like, but I desire now to do
all I can to efface that impression and to show that I am a man of heart
and conscience."
"I speak sincerely.”

Porfiry Petrovitch made a dignified pause."
"Raskolnikov felt a rush of
renewed alarm."
"The thought that Porfiry believed him to be innocent
began to make him uneasy."
"“It’s scarcely necessary to go over everything in detail,” Porfiry
Petrovitch went on."
"“Indeed, I could scarcely attempt it."
"To begin with
there were rumours."
"Through whom, how, and when those rumours came to
me... and how they affected you, I need not go into."
"My suspicions
were aroused by a complete accident, which might just as easily not have
happened."
What was it?
Hm!
"I believe there is no need to go into that
either."
Those rumours and that accident led to one idea in my mind.
"I
admit it openly--for one may as well make a clean breast of it--I was
the first to pitch on you."
"The old woman’s notes on the pledges and
the rest of it--that all came to nothing."
Yours was one of a hundred.
"I happened, too, to hear of the scene at the office, from a man who
described it capitally, unconsciously reproducing the scene with great
vividness."
"It was just one thing after another, Rodion Romanovitch, my
dear fellow!"
How could I avoid being brought to certain ideas?
"From a
hundred rabbits you can’t make a horse, a hundred suspicions don’t make
a proof, as the English proverb says, but that’s only from the rational
point of view--you can’t help being partial, for after all a lawyer
is only human."
"I thought, too, of your article in that journal, do you
remember, on your first visit we talked of it?"
"I jeered at you at the
time, but that was only to lead you on."
"I repeat, Rodion Romanovitch,
you are ill and impatient."
"That you were bold, headstrong, in earnest
and... had felt a great deal I recognised long before."
"I, too, have felt
the same, so that your article seemed familiar to me."
"It was conceived
on sleepless nights, with a throbbing heart, in ecstasy and suppressed
enthusiasm."
"And that proud suppressed enthusiasm in young people is
dangerous!"
"I jeered at you then, but let me tell you that, as a literary
amateur, I am awfully fond of such first essays, full of the heat of
youth."
There is a mistiness and a chord vibrating in the mist.
"Your
article is absurd and fantastic, but there’s a transparent sincerity,
a youthful incorruptible pride and the daring of despair in it."
"It’s a
gloomy article, but that’s what’s fine in it."
"I read your article and
put it aside, thinking as I did so ‘that man won’t go the common way.’
Well, I ask you, after that as a preliminary, how could I help being
carried away by what followed?"
"Oh, dear, I am not saying anything, I
am not making any statement now."
I simply noted it at the time.
"What is
there in it?"
I reflected.
"There’s nothing in it, that is really nothing
and perhaps absolutely nothing."
"And it’s not at all the thing for
the prosecutor to let himself be carried away by notions: here I have
Nikolay on my hands with actual evidence against him--you may think what
you like of it, but it’s evidence."
"He brings in his psychology, too; one
has to consider him, too, for it’s a matter of life and death."
"Why am
I explaining this to you?"
"That you may understand, and not blame my
malicious behaviour on that occasion."
"It was not malicious, I assure
you, he-he!"
"Do you suppose I didn’t come to search your room at the
time?"
"I did, I did, he-he!"
"I was here when you were lying ill in bed,
not officially, not in my own person, but I was here."
"Your room was
searched to the last thread at the first suspicion; but _umsonst_!"
"I
thought to myself, now that man will come, will come of himself and
quickly, too; if he’s guilty, he’s sure to come."
"Another man wouldn’t,
but he will."
"And you remember how Mr. Razumihin began discussing the
subject with you?"
"We arranged that to excite you, so we purposely spread
rumours, that he might discuss the case with you, and Razumihin is not a
man to restrain his indignation."
"Mr. Zametov was tremendously struck by
your anger and your open daring."
"Think of blurting out in a restaurant
‘I killed her.’ It was too daring, too reckless."
"I thought so myself, if
he is guilty he will be a formidable opponent."
"That was what I thought
at the time."
I was expecting you.
"But you simply bowled Zametov over
and... well, you see, it all lies in this--that this damnable psychology
can be taken two ways!"
"Well, I kept expecting you, and so it was, you
came!"
My heart was fairly throbbing.
Ach!
"“Now, why need you have come?"
"Your laughter, too, as you came in, do you
remember?"
"I saw it all plain as daylight, but if I hadn’t expected you
so specially, I should not have noticed anything in your laughter."
"You
see what influence a mood has!"
"Mr. Razumihin then--ah, that stone, that
stone under which the things were hidden!"
"I seem to see it somewhere
in a kitchen garden."
"It was in a kitchen garden, you told Zametov and
afterwards you repeated that in my office?"
"And when we began picking
your article to pieces, how you explained it!"
"One could take every word
of yours in two senses, as though there were another meaning hidden."
"“So in this way, Rodion Romanovitch, I reached the furthest limit, and
knocking my head against a post, I pulled myself up, asking myself what
I was about."
"After all, I said, you can take it all in another sense if
you like, and it’s more natural so, indeed."
"I couldn’t help admitting
it was more natural."
I was bothered!
"‘No, I’d better get hold of some
little fact’ I said."
"So when I heard of the bell-ringing, I held my
breath and was all in a tremor."
"‘Here is my little fact,’ thought I, and
I didn’t think it over, I simply wouldn’t."
"I would have given a thousand
roubles at that minute to have seen you with my own eyes, when you
walked a hundred paces beside that workman, after he had called you
murderer to your face, and you did not dare to ask him a question
all the way."
"And then what about your trembling, what about your
bell-ringing in your illness, in semi-delirium?"
"“And so, Rodion Romanovitch, can you wonder that I played such pranks on
you?"
And what made you come at that very minute?
"Someone seemed to
have sent you, by Jove!"
"And if Nikolay had not parted us... and do you
remember Nikolay at the time?"
Do you remember him clearly?
"It was a
thunderbolt, a regular thunderbolt!"
And how I met him!
"I didn’t believe
in the thunderbolt, not for a minute."
"You could see it for yourself;
and how could I?"
"Even afterwards, when you had gone and he began making
very, very plausible answers on certain points, so that I was surprised
at him myself, even then I didn’t believe his story!"
"You see what it is
to be as firm as a rock!"
"No, thought I, _Morgenfrüh_."
"What has Nikolay
got to do with it!”

“Razumihin told me just now that you think Nikolay guilty and had
yourself assured him of it....”

His voice failed him, and he broke off."
"He had been listening in
indescribable agitation, as this man who had seen through and through
him, went back upon himself."
"He was afraid of believing it and did not
believe it."
"In those still ambiguous words he kept eagerly looking for
something more definite and conclusive."
“Mr.
"Razumihin!” cried Porfiry Petrovitch, seeming glad of a question
from Raskolnikov, who had till then been silent."
“He-he-he!
"But I had to
put Mr. Razumihin off; two is company, three is none."
"Mr. Razumihin is
not the right man, besides he is an outsider."
"He came running to me
with a pale face...."
"But never mind him, why bring him in?"
"To return
to Nikolay, would you like to know what sort of a type he is, how I
understand him, that is?"
"To begin with, he is still a child and not
exactly a coward, but something by way of an artist."
"Really, don’t laugh
at my describing him so."
He is innocent and responsive to influence.
"He
has a heart, and is a fantastic fellow."
"He sings and dances, he tells
stories, they say, so that people come from other villages to hear him."
"He attends school too, and laughs till he cries if you hold up a finger
to him; he will drink himself senseless--not as a regular vice, but at
times, when people treat him, like a child."
"And he stole, too, then,
without knowing it himself, for ‘How can it be stealing, if one picks it
up?’ And do you know he is an Old Believer, or rather a dissenter?"
"There
have been Wanderers[*] in his family, and he was for two years in his
village under the spiritual guidance of a certain elder."
"I learnt all
this from Nikolay and from his fellow villagers."
"And what’s more, he
wanted to run into the wilderness!"
"He was full of fervour, prayed at
night, read the old books, ‘the true’ ones, and read himself crazy."
[*] A religious sect.--TRANSLATOR’S NOTE.
"“Petersburg had a great effect upon him, especially the women and the
wine."
He responds to everything and he forgot the elder and all that.
"I
learnt that an artist here took a fancy to him, and used to go and see
him, and now this business came upon him."
"“Well, he was frightened, he tried to hang himself!"
He ran away!
"How can
one get over the idea the people have of Russian legal proceedings?"
"The
very word ‘trial’ frightens some of them."
Whose fault is it?
"We shall
see what the new juries will do."
God grant they do good!
"Well, in
prison, it seems, he remembered the venerable elder; the Bible, too,
made its appearance again."
"Do you know, Rodion Romanovitch, the force of
the word ‘suffering’ among some of these people!"
"It’s not a question of
suffering for someone’s benefit, but simply, ‘one must suffer.’ If they
suffer at the hands of the authorities, so much the better."
"In my time
there was a very meek and mild prisoner who spent a whole year in prison
always reading his Bible on the stove at night and he read himself
crazy, and so crazy, do you know, that one day, apropos of nothing, he
seized a brick and flung it at the governor; though he had done him
no harm."
"And the way he threw it too: aimed it a yard on one side
on purpose, for fear of hurting him."
"Well, we know what happens to
a prisoner who assaults an officer with a weapon."
"So ‘he took his
suffering.’

“So I suspect now that Nikolay wants to take his suffering or something
of the sort."
"I know it for certain from facts, indeed."
"Only he doesn’t
know that I know."
"What, you don’t admit that there are such fantastic
people among the peasants?"
Lots of them.
"The elder now has begun
influencing him, especially since he tried to hang himself."
"But he’ll
come and tell me all himself."
You think he’ll hold out?
"Wait a bit,
he’ll take his words back."
"I am waiting from hour to hour for him to
come and abjure his evidence."
"I have come to like that Nikolay and am
studying him in detail."
And what do you think?
He-he!
"He answered me
very plausibly on some points, he obviously had collected some evidence
and prepared himself cleverly."
"But on other points he is simply at sea,
knows nothing and doesn’t even suspect that he doesn’t know!"
"“No, Rodion Romanovitch, Nikolay doesn’t come in!"
"This is a fantastic,
gloomy business, a modern case, an incident of to-day when the heart
of man is troubled, when the phrase is quoted that blood ‘renews,’ when
comfort is preached as the aim of life."
"Here we have bookish dreams, a
heart unhinged by theories."
"Here we see resolution in the first stage,
but resolution of a special kind: he resolved to do it like jumping over
a precipice or from a bell tower and his legs shook as he went to the
crime."
"He forgot to shut the door after him, and murdered two people for
a theory."
"He committed the murder and couldn’t take the money, and what
he did manage to snatch up he hid under a stone."
"It wasn’t enough for
him to suffer agony behind the door while they battered at the door and
rung the bell, no, he had to go to the empty lodging, half delirious, to
recall the bell-ringing, he wanted to feel the cold shiver over again....
Well, that we grant, was through illness, but consider this: he is
a murderer, but looks upon himself as an honest man, despises others,
poses as injured innocence."
"No, that’s not the work of a Nikolay, my
dear Rodion Romanovitch!”

All that had been said before had sounded so like a recantation that
these words were too great a shock."
"Raskolnikov shuddered as though he
had been stabbed."
"“Then... who then... is the murderer?” he asked in a breathless voice,
unable to restrain himself."
"Porfiry Petrovitch sank back in his chair, as though he were amazed at
the question."
"“Who is the murderer?” he repeated, as though unable to believe his
ears."
"“Why, _you_, Rodion Romanovitch!"
"You are the murderer,” he added,
almost in a whisper, in a voice of genuine conviction."
"Raskolnikov leapt from the sofa, stood up for a few seconds and sat down
again without uttering a word."
His face twitched convulsively.
"“Your lip is twitching just as it did before,” Porfiry Petrovitch
observed almost sympathetically."
"“You’ve been misunderstanding me, I
think, Rodion Romanovitch,” he added after a brief pause, “that’s why
you are so surprised."
"I came on purpose to tell you everything and deal
openly with you.”

“It was not I murdered her,” Raskolnikov whispered like a frightened
child caught in the act."
"“No, it was you, you Rodion Romanovitch, and no one else,” Porfiry
whispered sternly, with conviction."
"They were both silent and the silence lasted strangely long, about ten
minutes."
"Raskolnikov put his elbow on the table and passed his fingers
through his hair."
Porfiry Petrovitch sat quietly waiting.
"Suddenly
Raskolnikov looked scornfully at Porfiry."
"“You are at your old tricks again, Porfiry Petrovitch!"
"Your old method
again."
"I wonder you don’t get sick of it!”

“Oh, stop that, what does that matter now?"
"It would be a different
matter if there were witnesses present, but we are whispering alone."
"You
see yourself that I have not come to chase and capture you like a hare."
"Whether you confess it or not is nothing to me now; for myself, I am
convinced without it.”

“If so, what did you come for?” Raskolnikov asked irritably."
"“I ask you
the same question again: if you consider me guilty, why don’t you take
me to prison?”

“Oh, that’s your question!"
"I will answer you, point for point."
"In the
first place, to arrest you so directly is not to my interest.”

“How so?"
"If you are convinced you ought....”

“Ach, what if I am convinced?"
That’s only my dream for the time.
"Why
should I put you in safety?"
"You know that’s it, since you ask me to do
it."
"If I confront you with that workman for instance and you say to him
‘were you drunk or not?"
Who saw me with you?
"I simply took you to be
drunk, and you were drunk, too.’ Well, what could I answer, especially
as your story is a more likely one than his?"
"for there’s nothing but
psychology to support his evidence--that’s almost unseemly with his ugly
mug, while you hit the mark exactly, for the rascal is an inveterate
drunkard and notoriously so."
"And I have myself admitted candidly several
times already that that psychology can be taken in two ways and that the
second way is stronger and looks far more probable, and that apart from
that I have as yet nothing against you."
"And though I shall put you in
prison and indeed have come--quite contrary to etiquette--to inform you
of it beforehand, yet I tell you frankly, also contrary to etiquette,
that it won’t be to my advantage."
"Well, secondly, I’ve come to you
because...”

“Yes, yes, secondly?” Raskolnikov was listening breathless."
"“Because, as I told you just now, I consider I owe you an explanation."
"I
don’t want you to look upon me as a monster, as I have a genuine liking
for you, you may believe me or not."
"And in the third place I’ve come to
you with a direct and open proposition--that you should surrender
and confess."
"It will be infinitely more to your advantage and to my
advantage too, for my task will be done."
"Well, is this open on my part
or not?”

Raskolnikov thought a minute."
"“Listen, Porfiry Petrovitch."
"You said just now you have nothing but
psychology to go on, yet now you’ve gone on mathematics."
"Well, what if
you are mistaken yourself, now?”

“No, Rodion Romanovitch, I am not mistaken."
"I have a little fact even
then, Providence sent it me.”

“What little fact?”

“I won’t tell you what, Rodion Romanovitch."
"And in any case, I haven’t
the right to put it off any longer, I must arrest you."
"So think it over:
it makes no difference to me _now_ and so I speak only for your sake."
"Believe me, it will be better, Rodion Romanovitch.”

Raskolnikov smiled malignantly."
"“That’s not simply ridiculous, it’s positively shameless."
"Why, even if I
were guilty, which I don’t admit, what reason should I have to confess,
when you tell me yourself that I shall be in greater safety in prison?”

“Ah, Rodion Romanovitch, don’t put too much faith in words, perhaps
prison will not be altogether a restful place."
"That’s only theory and
my theory, and what authority am I for you?"
"Perhaps, too, even now I am
hiding something from you?"
"I can’t lay bare everything, he-he!"
"And how
can you ask what advantage?"
"Don’t you know how it would lessen your
sentence?"
"You would be confessing at a moment when another man has taken
the crime on himself and so has muddled the whole case."
Consider that!
"I
swear before God that I will so arrange that your confession shall
come as a complete surprise."
"We will make a clean sweep of all these
psychological points, of a suspicion against you, so that your crime
will appear to have been something like an aberration, for in truth it
was an aberration."
"I am an honest man, Rodion Romanovitch, and will keep
my word.”

Raskolnikov maintained a mournful silence and let his head sink
dejectedly."
"He pondered a long while and at last smiled again, but his
smile was sad and gentle."
"“No!” he said, apparently abandoning all attempt to keep up appearances
with Porfiry, “it’s not worth it, I don’t care about lessening the
sentence!”

“That’s just what I was afraid of!” Porfiry cried warmly and, as it
seemed, involuntarily."
"“That’s just what I feared, that you wouldn’t
care about the mitigation of sentence.”

Raskolnikov looked sadly and expressively at him."
"“Ah, don’t disdain life!” Porfiry went on."
"“You have a great deal of
it still before you."
"How can you say you don’t want a mitigation of
sentence?"
"You are an impatient fellow!”

“A great deal of what lies before me?”

“Of life."
"What sort of prophet are you, do you know much about it?"
"Seek
and ye shall find."
This may be God’s means for bringing you to Him.
"And
it’s not for ever, the bondage....”

“The time will be shortened,” laughed Raskolnikov."
"“Why, is it the bourgeois disgrace you are afraid of?"
"It may be that you
are afraid of it without knowing it, because you are young!"
"But anyway
_you_ shouldn’t be afraid of giving yourself up and confessing.”

“Ach, hang it!” Raskolnikov whispered with loathing and contempt, as
though he did not want to speak aloud."
"He got up again as though he meant to go away, but sat down again in
evident despair."
"“Hang it, if you like!"
"You’ve lost faith and you think that I am
grossly flattering you; but how long has your life been?"
"How much do
you understand?"
"You made up a theory and then were ashamed that it broke
down and turned out to be not at all original!"
"It turned out something
base, that’s true, but you are not hopelessly base."
By no means so base!
"At least you didn’t deceive yourself for long, you went straight to the
furthest point at one bound."
How do I regard you?
"I regard you as one
of those men who would stand and smile at their torturer while he cuts
their entrails out, if only they have found faith or God."
"Find it and
you will live."
You have long needed a change of air.
"Suffering, too,
is a good thing."
Suffer!
Maybe Nikolay is right in wanting to suffer.
"I know you don’t believe in it--but don’t be over-wise; fling yourself
straight into life, without deliberation; don’t be afraid--the flood
will bear you to the bank and set you safe on your feet again."
"What
bank?"
How can I tell?
"I only believe that you have long life before
you."
"I know that you take all my words now for a set speech prepared
beforehand, but maybe you will remember them after."
"They may be of use
some time."
That’s why I speak.
"It’s as well that you only killed the
old woman."
"If you’d invented another theory you might perhaps have
done something a thousand times more hideous."
"You ought to thank God,
perhaps."
How do you know?
Perhaps God is saving you for something.
But keep a good heart and have less fear!
"Are you afraid of the great
expiation before you?"
"No, it would be shameful to be afraid of it."
"Since
you have taken such a step, you must harden your heart."
"There is justice
in it."
You must fulfil the demands of justice.
"I know that you don’t
believe it, but indeed, life will bring you through."
"You will live it
down in time."
"What you need now is fresh air, fresh air, fresh air!”

Raskolnikov positively started."
“But who are you?
what prophet are you?
"From the height of what majestic
calm do you proclaim these words of wisdom?”

“Who am I?"
"I am a man with nothing to hope for, that’s all."
"A man
perhaps of feeling and sympathy, maybe of some knowledge too, but my day
is over."
"But you are a different matter, there is life waiting for you."
"Though, who knows?"
"maybe your life, too, will pass off in smoke and come
to nothing."
"Come, what does it matter, that you will pass into another
class of men?"
"It’s not comfort you regret, with your heart!"
"What of
it that perhaps no one will see you for so long?"
"It’s not time, but
yourself that will decide that."
Be the sun and all will see you.
"The
sun has before all to be the sun."
Why are you smiling again?
"At my being
such a Schiller?"
"I bet you’re imagining that I am trying to get round
you by flattery."
"Well, perhaps I am, he-he-he!"
"Perhaps you’d better not
believe my word, perhaps you’d better never believe it altogether--I’m
made that way, I confess it."
"But let me add, you can judge for yourself,
I think, how far I am a base sort of man and how far I am honest.”

“When do you mean to arrest me?”

“Well, I can let you walk about another day or two."
"Think it over, my
dear fellow, and pray to God."
"It’s more in your interest, believe me.”

“And what if I run away?” asked Raskolnikov with a strange smile."
"“No, you won’t run away."
"A peasant would run away, a fashionable
dissenter would run away, the flunkey of another man’s thought, for
you’ve only to show him the end of your little finger and he’ll be ready
to believe in anything for the rest of his life."
"But you’ve ceased to
believe in your theory already, what will you run away with?"
"And what
would you do in hiding?"
"It would be hateful and difficult for you, and
what you need more than anything in life is a definite position, an
atmosphere to suit you."
And what sort of atmosphere would you have?
"If
you ran away, you’d come back to yourself."
"_You can’t get on without
us._ And if I put you in prison--say you’ve been there a month, or two,
or three--remember my word, you’ll confess of yourself and perhaps to
your own surprise."
"You won’t know an hour beforehand that you are coming
with a confession."
"I am convinced that you will decide, ‘to take your
suffering.’ You don’t believe my words now, but you’ll come to it of
yourself."
"For suffering, Rodion Romanovitch, is a great thing."
"Never
mind my having grown fat, I know all the same."
"Don’t laugh at it,
there’s an idea in suffering, Nikolay is right."
"No, you won’t run away,
Rodion Romanovitch.”

Raskolnikov got up and took his cap."
Porfiry Petrovitch also rose.
“Are you going for a walk?
"The evening will be fine, if only we don’t
have a storm."
"Though it would be a good thing to freshen the air.”

He, too, took his cap."
"“Porfiry Petrovitch, please don’t take up the notion that I have
confessed to you to-day,” Raskolnikov pronounced with sullen insistence."
“You’re a strange man and I have listened to you from simple curiosity.
"But I have admitted nothing, remember that!”

“Oh, I know that, I’ll remember."
"Look at him, he’s trembling!"
"Don’t
be uneasy, my dear fellow, have it your own way."
"Walk about a bit, you
won’t be able to walk too far."
"If anything happens, I have one request
to make of you,” he added, dropping his voice."
"“It’s an awkward one, but
important."
"If anything were to happen (though indeed I don’t believe
in it and think you quite incapable of it), yet in case you were taken
during these forty or fifty hours with the notion of putting an end to
the business in some other way, in some fantastic fashion--laying hands
on yourself--(it’s an absurd proposition, but you must forgive me for
it) do leave a brief but precise note, only two lines, and mention the
stone."
It will be more generous.
"Come, till we meet!"
"Good thoughts and
sound decisions to you!”

Porfiry went out, stooping and avoiding looking at Raskolnikov."
"The
latter went to the window and waited with irritable impatience till he
calculated that Porfiry had reached the street and moved away."
"Then he
too went hurriedly out of the room."
"CHAPTER III

He hurried to Svidrigaïlov’s."
"What he had to hope from that man he
did not know."
But that man had some hidden power over him.
"Having once
recognised this, he could not rest, and now the time had come."
"On the way, one question particularly worried him: had Svidrigaïlov been
to Porfiry’s?"
"As far as he could judge, he would swear to it, that he had not."
"He
pondered again and again, went over Porfiry’s visit; no, he hadn’t been,
of course he hadn’t."
"But if he had not been yet, would he go?"
"Meanwhile, for the present he
fancied he couldn’t."
Why?
"He could not have explained, but if he could,
he would not have wasted much thought over it at the moment."
"It all
worried him and at the same time he could not attend to it."
"Strange to
say, none would have believed it perhaps, but he only felt a faint vague
anxiety about his immediate future."
"Another, much more important anxiety
tormented him--it concerned himself, but in a different, more vital way."
"Moreover, he was conscious of immense moral fatigue, though his mind was
working better that morning than it had done of late."
"And was it worth while, after all that had happened, to contend with
these new trivial difficulties?"
"Was it worth while, for instance, to
manoeuvre that Svidrigaïlov should not go to Porfiry’s?"
"Was it worth
while to investigate, to ascertain the facts, to waste time over anyone
like Svidrigaïlov?"
"Oh, how sick he was of it all!"
"And yet he was hastening to Svidrigaïlov; could he be expecting
something _new_ from him, information, or means of escape?"
"Men will
catch at straws!"
Was it destiny or some instinct bringing them together?
"Perhaps it was only fatigue, despair; perhaps it was not Svidrigaïlov
but some other whom he needed, and Svidrigaïlov had simply presented
himself by chance."
Sonia?
But what should he go to Sonia for now?
"To beg
her tears again?"
"He was afraid of Sonia, too."
"Sonia stood before him as
an irrevocable sentence."
He must go his own way or hers.
"At that moment
especially he did not feel equal to seeing her."
"No, would it not be
better to try Svidrigaïlov?"
"And he could not help inwardly owning that
he had long felt that he must see him for some reason."
But what could they have in common?
"Their very evil-doing could not
be of the same kind."
"The man, moreover, was very unpleasant, evidently
depraved, undoubtedly cunning and deceitful, possibly malignant."
"Such
stories were told about him."
"It is true he was befriending Katerina
Ivanovna’s children, but who could tell with what motive and what it
meant?"
"The man always had some design, some project."
"There was another thought which had been continually hovering of late
about Raskolnikov’s mind, and causing him great uneasiness."
"It was so
painful that he made distinct efforts to get rid of it."
"He sometimes
thought that Svidrigaïlov was dogging his footsteps."
"Svidrigaïlov had
found out his secret and had had designs on Dounia."
"What if he had them
still?"
Wasn’t it practically certain that he had?
"And what if, having
learnt his secret and so having gained power over him, he were to use it
as a weapon against Dounia?"
"This idea sometimes even tormented his dreams, but it had never
presented itself so vividly to him as on his way to Svidrigaïlov."
The very thought moved him to gloomy rage.
"To begin with, this would
transform everything, even his own position; he would have at once to
confess his secret to Dounia."
"Would he have to give himself up perhaps
to prevent Dounia from taking some rash step?"
The letter?
"This morning
Dounia had received a letter."
"From whom could she get letters in
Petersburg?"
"Luzhin, perhaps?"
"It’s true Razumihin was there to protect
her, but Razumihin knew nothing of the position."
"Perhaps it was his duty
to tell Razumihin?"
He thought of it with repugnance.
"In any case he must see Svidrigaïlov as soon as possible, he decided
finally."
"Thank God, the details of the interview were of little
consequence, if only he could get at the root of the matter; but
if Svidrigaïlov were capable... if he were intriguing against
Dounia--then...

Raskolnikov was so exhausted by what he had passed through that month
that he could only decide such questions in one way; “then I shall kill
him,” he thought in cold despair."
"A sudden anguish oppressed his heart, he stood still in the middle of
the street and began looking about to see where he was and which way he
was going."
He found himself in X.
"Prospect, thirty or forty paces from
the Hay Market, through which he had come."
"The whole second storey of
the house on the left was used as a tavern."
"All the windows were wide
open; judging from the figures moving at the windows, the rooms were
full to overflowing."
"There were sounds of singing, of clarionet and
violin, and the boom of a Turkish drum."
He could hear women shrieking.
He was about to turn back wondering why he had come to the X.
"Prospect,
when suddenly at one of the end windows he saw Svidrigaïlov, sitting
at a tea-table right in the open window with a pipe in his mouth."
"Raskolnikov was dreadfully taken aback, almost terrified."
"Svidrigaïlov
was silently watching and scrutinising him and, what struck Raskolnikov
at once, seemed to be meaning to get up and slip away unobserved."
"Raskolnikov at once pretended not to have seen him, but to be looking
absent-mindedly away, while he watched him out of the corner of his eye."
His heart was beating violently.
"Yet, it was evident that Svidrigaïlov
did not want to be seen."
"He took the pipe out of his mouth and was on
the point of concealing himself, but as he got up and moved back his
chair, he seemed to have become suddenly aware that Raskolnikov had seen
him, and was watching him."
"What had passed between them was much the
same as what happened at their first meeting in Raskolnikov’s room."
"A
sly smile came into Svidrigaïlov’s face and grew broader and
broader."
Each knew that he was seen and watched by the other.
"At last
Svidrigaïlov broke into a loud laugh."
"“Well, well, come in if you want me; I am here!” he shouted from the
window."
Raskolnikov went up into the tavern.
"He found Svidrigaïlov in a tiny
back room, adjoining the saloon in which merchants, clerks and numbers
of people of all sorts were drinking tea at twenty little tables to the
desperate bawling of a chorus of singers."
"The click of billiard balls
could be heard in the distance."
"On the table before Svidrigaïlov stood
an open bottle and a glass half full of champagne."
"In the room he found
also a boy with a little hand organ, a healthy-looking red-cheeked girl
of eighteen, wearing a tucked-up striped skirt, and a Tyrolese hat with
ribbons."
"In spite of the chorus in the other room, she was singing some
servants’ hall song in a rather husky contralto, to the accompaniment of
the organ."
"“Come, that’s enough,” Svidrigaïlov stopped her at Raskolnikov’s
entrance."
The girl at once broke off and stood waiting respectfully.
"She had sung her guttural rhymes, too, with a serious and respectful
expression in her face."
"“Hey, Philip, a glass!” shouted Svidrigaïlov."
"“I won’t drink anything,” said Raskolnikov."
"“As you like, I didn’t mean it for you."
"Drink, Katia!"
"I don’t want
anything more to-day, you can go.” He poured her out a full glass, and
laid down a yellow note."
"Katia drank off her glass of wine, as women do, without putting it down,
in twenty gulps, took the note and kissed Svidrigaïlov’s hand, which he
allowed quite seriously."
"She went out of the room and the boy trailed
after her with the organ."
Both had been brought in from the street.
"Svidrigaïlov had not been a week in Petersburg, but everything about him
was already, so to speak, on a patriarchal footing; the waiter, Philip,
was by now an old friend and very obsequious."
The door leading to the saloon had a lock on it.
"Svidrigaïlov was at
home in this room and perhaps spent whole days in it."
"The tavern was
dirty and wretched, not even second-rate."
"“I was going to see you and looking for you,” Raskolnikov began, “but
I don’t know what made me turn from the Hay Market into the X."
"Prospect
just now."
I never take this turning.
"I turn to the right from the Hay
Market."
And this isn’t the way to you.
I simply turned and here you are.
"It is strange!”

“Why don’t you say at once ‘it’s a miracle’?”

“Because it may be only chance.”

“Oh, that’s the way with all you folk,” laughed Svidrigaïlov."
"“You won’t
admit it, even if you do inwardly believe it a miracle!"
"Here you say
that it may be only chance."
"And what cowards they all are here, about
having an opinion of their own, you can’t fancy, Rodion Romanovitch."
"I
don’t mean you, you have an opinion of your own and are not afraid to
have it."
"That’s how it was you attracted my curiosity.”

“Nothing else?”

“Well, that’s enough, you know,” Svidrigaïlov was obviously exhilarated,
but only slightly so, he had not had more than half a glass of wine."
"“I fancy you came to see me before you knew that I was capable of having
what you call an opinion of my own,” observed Raskolnikov."
"“Oh, well, it was a different matter."
Everyone has his own plans.
"And
apropos of the miracle let me tell you that I think you have been asleep
for the last two or three days."
"I told you of this tavern myself, there
is no miracle in your coming straight here."
"I explained the way myself,
told you where it was, and the hours you could find me here."
"Do you
remember?”

“I don’t remember,” answered Raskolnikov with surprise."
“I believe you.
I told you twice.
"The address has been stamped
mechanically on your memory."
"You turned this way mechanically and yet
precisely according to the direction, though you are not aware of
it."
"When I told you then, I hardly hoped you understood me."
"You give
yourself away too much, Rodion Romanovitch."
"And another thing, I’m
convinced there are lots of people in Petersburg who talk to themselves
as they walk."
This is a town of crazy people.
"If only we had scientific
men, doctors, lawyers and philosophers might make most valuable
investigations in Petersburg each in his own line."
"There are few places
where there are so many gloomy, strong and queer influences on the soul
of man as in Petersburg."
The mere influences of climate mean so much.
"And it’s the administrative centre of all Russia and its character must
be reflected on the whole country."
"But that is neither here nor there
now."
The point is that I have several times watched you.
"You walk out
of your house--holding your head high--twenty paces from home you let it
sink, and fold your hands behind your back."
"You look and evidently see
nothing before nor beside you."
"At last you begin moving your lips and
talking to yourself, and sometimes you wave one hand and declaim, and at
last stand still in the middle of the road."
That’s not at all the thing.
"Someone may be watching you besides me, and it won’t do you any good."
"It’s nothing really to do with me and I can’t cure you, but, of course,
you understand me.”

“Do you know that I am being followed?” asked Raskolnikov, looking
inquisitively at him."
"“No, I know nothing about it,” said Svidrigaïlov, seeming surprised."
"“Well, then, let us leave me alone,” Raskolnikov muttered, frowning."
"“Very good, let us leave you alone.”

“You had better tell me, if you come here to drink, and directed me
twice to come here to you, why did you hide, and try to get away just
now when I looked at the window from the street?"
"I saw it.”

“He-he!"
"And why was it you lay on your sofa with closed eyes and
pretended to be asleep, though you were wide awake while I stood in your
doorway?"
"I saw it.”

“I may have had... reasons."
"You know that yourself.”

“And I may have had my reasons, though you don’t know them.”

Raskolnikov dropped his right elbow on the table, leaned his chin in the
fingers of his right hand, and stared intently at Svidrigaïlov."
"For a
full minute he scrutinised his face, which had impressed him before."
"It
was a strange face, like a mask; white and red, with bright red lips,
with a flaxen beard, and still thick flaxen hair."
"His eyes were somehow
too blue and their expression somehow too heavy and fixed."
"There was
something awfully unpleasant in that handsome face, which looked so
wonderfully young for his age."
"Svidrigaïlov was smartly dressed in light
summer clothes and was particularly dainty in his linen."
"He wore a huge
ring with a precious stone in it."
"“Have I got to bother myself about you, too, now?” said Raskolnikov
suddenly, coming with nervous impatience straight to the point."
"“Even
though perhaps you are the most dangerous man if you care to injure me,
I don’t want to put myself out any more."
"I will show you at once that I
don’t prize myself as you probably think I do."
"I’ve come to tell you at
once that if you keep to your former intentions with regard to my sister
and if you think to derive any benefit in that direction from what has
been discovered of late, I will kill you before you get me locked up."
You can reckon on my word.
You know that I can keep it.
"And in the
second place if you want to tell me anything--for I keep fancying all
this time that you have something to tell me--make haste and tell it,
for time is precious and very likely it will soon be too late.”

“Why in such haste?” asked Svidrigaïlov, looking at him curiously."
"“Everyone has his plans,” Raskolnikov answered gloomily and impatiently."
"“You urged me yourself to frankness just now, and at the first question
you refuse to answer,” Svidrigaïlov observed with a smile."
"“You
keep fancying that I have aims of my own and so you look at me with
suspicion."
Of course it’s perfectly natural in your position.
"But
though I should like to be friends with you, I shan’t trouble myself
to convince you of the contrary."
"The game isn’t worth the candle and I
wasn’t intending to talk to you about anything special.”

“What did you want me, for, then?"
"It was you who came hanging about me.”

“Why, simply as an interesting subject for observation."
"I liked the
fantastic nature of your position--that’s what it was!"
"Besides you are
the brother of a person who greatly interested me, and from that person
I had in the past heard a very great deal about you, from which I
gathered that you had a great influence over her; isn’t that enough?"
Ha-ha-ha!
"Still I must admit that your question is rather complex, and
is difficult for me to answer."
"Here, you, for instance, have come to me
not only for a definite object, but for the sake of hearing something
new."
Isn’t that so?
"Isn’t that so?” persisted Svidrigaïlov with a sly
smile."
"“Well, can’t you fancy then that I, too, on my way here in the
train was reckoning on you, on your telling me something new, and on my
making some profit out of you!"
"You see what rich men we are!”

“What profit could you make?”

“How can I tell you?"
How do I know?
"You see in what a tavern I spend all
my time and it’s my enjoyment, that’s to say it’s no great enjoyment,
but one must sit somewhere; that poor Katia now--you saw her?..."
"If only
I had been a glutton now, a club gourmand, but you see I can eat this.”

He pointed to a little table in the corner where the remnants of a
terrible-looking beef-steak and potatoes lay on a tin dish."
"“Have you dined, by the way?"
I’ve had something and want nothing more.
"I don’t drink, for instance, at all."
"Except for champagne I never touch
anything, and not more than a glass of that all the evening, and even
that is enough to make my head ache."
"I ordered it just now to wind
myself up, for I am just going off somewhere and you see me in a
peculiar state of mind."
"That was why I hid myself just now like a
schoolboy, for I was afraid you would hinder me."
"But I believe,” he
pulled out his watch, “I can spend an hour with you."
"It’s half-past
four now."
"If only I’d been something, a landowner, a father, a cavalry
officer, a photographer, a journalist..."
"I am nothing, no specialty,
and sometimes I am positively bored."
"I really thought you would tell me
something new.”

“But what are you, and why have you come here?”

“What am I?"
"You know, a gentleman, I served for two years in the
cavalry, then I knocked about here in Petersburg, then I married Marfa
Petrovna and lived in the country."
"There you have my biography!”

“You are a gambler, I believe?”

“No, a poor sort of gambler."
"A card-sharper--not a gambler.”

“You have been a card-sharper then?”

“Yes, I’ve been a card-sharper too.”

“Didn’t you get thrashed sometimes?”

“It did happen."
"Why?”

“Why, you might have challenged them... altogether it must have been
lively.”

“I won’t contradict you, and besides I am no hand at philosophy."
"I
confess that I hastened here for the sake of the women.”

“As soon as you buried Marfa Petrovna?”

“Quite so,” Svidrigaïlov smiled with engaging candour."
“What of it?
"You
seem to find something wrong in my speaking like that about women?”

“You ask whether I find anything wrong in vice?”

“Vice!"
"Oh, that’s what you are after!"
"But I’ll answer you in order,
first about women in general; you know I am fond of talking."
"Tell me,
what should I restrain myself for?"
"Why should I give up women, since I
have a passion for them?"
"It’s an occupation, anyway.”

“So you hope for nothing here but vice?”

“Oh, very well, for vice then."
You insist on its being vice.
"But anyway
I like a direct question."
"In this vice at least there is something
permanent, founded indeed upon nature and not dependent on fantasy,
something present in the blood like an ever-burning ember, for ever
setting one on fire and, maybe, not to be quickly extinguished, even
with years."
"You’ll agree it’s an occupation of a sort.”

“That’s nothing to rejoice at, it’s a disease and a dangerous one.”

“Oh, that’s what you think, is it!"
"I agree, that it is a disease like
everything that exceeds moderation."
"And, of course, in this one must
exceed moderation."
"But in the first place, everybody does so in one way
or another, and in the second place, of course, one ought to be moderate
and prudent, however mean it may be, but what am I to do?"
"If I hadn’t
this, I might have to shoot myself."
"I am ready to admit that a decent
man ought to put up with being bored, but yet...”

“And could you shoot yourself?”

“Oh, come!” Svidrigaïlov parried with disgust."
"“Please don’t speak of
it,” he added hurriedly and with none of the bragging tone he had shown
in all the previous conversation."
His face quite changed.
"“I admit it’s
an unpardonable weakness, but I can’t help it."
"I am afraid of death and
I dislike its being talked of."
"Do you know that I am to a certain extent
a mystic?”

“Ah, the apparitions of Marfa Petrovna!"
"Do they still go on visiting
you?”

“Oh, don’t talk of them; there have been no more in Petersburg, confound
them!” he cried with an air of irritation."
"“Let’s rather talk of that...
though... H’m!"
"I have not much time, and can’t stay long with you,
it’s a pity!"
"I should have found plenty to tell you.”

“What’s your engagement, a woman?”

“Yes, a woman, a casual incident.... No, that’s not what I want to talk
of.”

“And the hideousness, the filthiness of all your surroundings, doesn’t
that affect you?"
"Have you lost the strength to stop yourself?”

“And do you pretend to strength, too?"
He-he-he!
"You surprised me just
now, Rodion Romanovitch, though I knew beforehand it would be so."
You preach to me about vice and æsthetics!
"You--a Schiller, you--an
idealist!"
"Of course that’s all as it should be and it would be
surprising if it were not so, yet it is strange in reality.... Ah,
what a pity I have no time, for you’re a most interesting type!"
"And,
by-the-way, are you fond of Schiller?"
"I am awfully fond of him.”

“But what a braggart you are,” Raskolnikov said with some disgust."
"“Upon my word, I am not,” answered Svidrigaïlov laughing."
"“However, I
won’t dispute it, let me be a braggart, why not brag, if it hurts no
one?"
"I spent seven years in the country with Marfa Petrovna, so now when
I come across an intelligent person like you--intelligent and highly
interesting--I am simply glad to talk and, besides, I’ve drunk that
half-glass of champagne and it’s gone to my head a little."
"And besides,
there’s a certain fact that has wound me up tremendously, but about that
I... will keep quiet."
Where are you off to?” he asked in alarm.
Raskolnikov had begun getting up.
"He felt oppressed and stifled and,
as it were, ill at ease at having come here."
"He felt convinced that
Svidrigaïlov was the most worthless scoundrel on the face of the earth."
“A-ach!
"Sit down, stay a little!” Svidrigaïlov begged."
"“Let them bring
you some tea, anyway."
"Stay a little, I won’t talk nonsense, about
myself, I mean."
I’ll tell you something.
"If you like I’ll tell you how a
woman tried ‘to save’ me, as you would call it?"
"It will be an answer to
your first question indeed, for the woman was your sister."
"May I tell
you?"
"It will help to spend the time.”

“Tell me, but I trust that you...”

“Oh, don’t be uneasy."
"Besides, even in a worthless low fellow like me,
Avdotya Romanovna can only excite the deepest respect.”



CHAPTER IV

“You know perhaps--yes, I told you myself,” began Svidrigaïlov, “that
I was in the debtors’ prison here, for an immense sum, and had not
any expectation of being able to pay it."
"There’s no need to go into
particulars how Marfa Petrovna bought me out; do you know to what a
point of insanity a woman can sometimes love?"
"She was an honest woman,
and very sensible, although completely uneducated."
"Would you believe
that this honest and jealous woman, after many scenes of hysterics and
reproaches, condescended to enter into a kind of contract with me which
she kept throughout our married life?"
"She was considerably older than
I, and besides, she always kept a clove or something in her mouth."
"There
was so much swinishness in my soul and honesty too, of a sort, as to
tell her straight out that I couldn’t be absolutely faithful to her."
"This confession drove her to frenzy, but yet she seems in a way to have
liked my brutal frankness."
"She thought it showed I was unwilling to
deceive her if I warned her like this beforehand and for a jealous
woman, you know, that’s the first consideration."
"After many tears an
unwritten contract was drawn up between us: first, that I would never
leave Marfa Petrovna and would always be her husband; secondly, that I
would never absent myself without her permission; thirdly, that I would
never set up a permanent mistress; fourthly, in return for this, Marfa
Petrovna gave me a free hand with the maidservants, but only with her
secret knowledge; fifthly, God forbid my falling in love with a woman of
our class; sixthly, in case I--which God forbid--should be visited by
a great serious passion I was bound to reveal it to Marfa Petrovna."
"On
this last score, however, Marfa Petrovna was fairly at ease."
"She was a
sensible woman and so she could not help looking upon me as a dissolute
profligate incapable of real love."
"But a sensible woman and a jealous
woman are two very different things, and that’s where the trouble
came in."
"But to judge some people impartially we must renounce certain
preconceived opinions and our habitual attitude to the ordinary people
about us."
"I have reason to have faith in your judgment rather than
in anyone’s."
"Perhaps you have already heard a great deal that was
ridiculous and absurd about Marfa Petrovna."
"She certainly had some very
ridiculous ways, but I tell you frankly that I feel really sorry for the
innumerable woes of which I was the cause."
"Well, and that’s enough, I
think, by way of a decorous _oraison funèbre_ for the most tender wife
of a most tender husband."
"When we quarrelled, I usually held my tongue
and did not irritate her and that gentlemanly conduct rarely failed to
attain its object, it influenced her, it pleased her, indeed."
"These were
times when she was positively proud of me."
"But your sister she couldn’t
put up with, anyway."
"And however she came to risk taking such a
beautiful creature into her house as a governess."
"My explanation is that
Marfa Petrovna was an ardent and impressionable woman and simply fell
in love herself--literally fell in love--with your sister."
"Well, little
wonder--look at Avdotya Romanovna!"
"I saw the danger at the first glance
and what do you think, I resolved not to look at her even."
"But Avdotya
Romanovna herself made the first step, would you believe it?"
"Would you
believe it too that Marfa Petrovna was positively angry with me at first
for my persistent silence about your sister, for my careless reception
of her continual adoring praises of Avdotya Romanovna."
"I don’t know
what it was she wanted!"
"Well, of course, Marfa Petrovna told Avdotya
Romanovna every detail about me."
"She had the unfortunate habit of
telling literally everyone all our family secrets and continually
complaining of me; how could she fail to confide in such a delightful
new friend?"
"I expect they talked of nothing else but me and no doubt
Avdotya Romanovna heard all those dark mysterious rumours that were
current about me...."
"I don’t mind betting that you too have heard
something of the sort already?”

“I have."
Luzhin charged you with having caused the death of a child.
"Is
that true?”

“Don’t refer to those vulgar tales, I beg,” said Svidrigaïlov with
disgust and annoyance."
"“If you insist on wanting to know about all that
idiocy, I will tell you one day, but now...”

“I was told too about some footman of yours in the country whom you
treated badly.”

“I beg you to drop the subject,” Svidrigaïlov interrupted again with
obvious impatience."
“Was that the footman who came to you after death to fill your pipe?...
"you told me about it yourself.” Raskolnikov felt more and more
irritated."
"Svidrigaïlov looked at him attentively and Raskolnikov fancied he caught
a flash of spiteful mockery in that look."
"But Svidrigaïlov restrained
himself and answered very civilly:

“Yes, it was."
"I see that you, too, are extremely interested and shall
feel it my duty to satisfy your curiosity at the first opportunity."
"Upon
my soul!"
"I see that I really might pass for a romantic figure with
some people."
"Judge how grateful I must be to Marfa Petrovna for having
repeated to Avdotya Romanovna such mysterious and interesting gossip
about me."
"I dare not guess what impression it made on her, but in any
case it worked in my interests."
"With all Avdotya Romanovna’s natural
aversion and in spite of my invariably gloomy and repellent aspect--she
did at least feel pity for me, pity for a lost soul."
"And if once a
girl’s heart is moved to _pity_, it’s more dangerous than anything."
"She
is bound to want to ‘save him,’ to bring him to his senses, and lift
him up and draw him to nobler aims, and restore him to new life and
usefulness--well, we all know how far such dreams can go."
"I saw at once
that the bird was flying into the cage of herself."
And I too made ready.
"I think you are frowning, Rodion Romanovitch?"
There’s no need.
"As you
know, it all ended in smoke."
"(Hang it all, what a lot I am drinking!)"
"Do you know, I always, from the very beginning, regretted that it wasn’t
your sister’s fate to be born in the second or third century A.D., as
the daughter of a reigning prince or some governor or pro-consul in Asia
Minor."
"She would undoubtedly have been one of those who would endure
martyrdom and would have smiled when they branded her bosom with hot
pincers."
And she would have gone to it of herself.
"And in the fourth or
fifth century she would have walked away into the Egyptian desert and
would have stayed there thirty years living on roots and ecstasies and
visions."
"She is simply thirsting to face some torture for someone, and
if she can’t get her torture, she’ll throw herself out of a window."
"I’ve
heard something of a Mr. Razumihin--he’s said to be a sensible fellow;
his surname suggests it, indeed."
He’s probably a divinity student.
"Well,
he’d better look after your sister!"
"I believe I understand her, and I am
proud of it."
"But at the beginning of an acquaintance, as you know, one
is apt to be more heedless and stupid."
One doesn’t see clearly.
"Hang it
all, why is she so handsome?"
It’s not my fault.
"In fact, it began on
my side with a most irresistible physical desire."
"Avdotya Romanovna is
awfully chaste, incredibly and phenomenally so."
"Take note, I tell you
this about your sister as a fact."
"She is almost morbidly chaste, in
spite of her broad intelligence, and it will stand in her way."
"There
happened to be a girl in the house then, Parasha, a black-eyed
wench, whom I had never seen before--she had just come from another
village--very pretty, but incredibly stupid: she burst into tears,
wailed so that she could be heard all over the place and caused scandal."
"One day after dinner Avdotya Romanovna followed me into an avenue in
the garden and with flashing eyes _insisted_ on my leaving poor Parasha
alone."
It was almost our first conversation by ourselves.
"I, of course,
was only too pleased to obey her wishes, tried to appear disconcerted,
embarrassed, in fact played my part not badly."
"Then came interviews,
mysterious conversations, exhortations, entreaties, supplications, even
tears--would you believe it, even tears?"
"Think what the passion for
propaganda will bring some girls to!"
"I, of course, threw it all on
my destiny, posed as hungering and thirsting for light, and finally
resorted to the most powerful weapon in the subjection of the
female heart, a weapon which never fails one."
"It’s the well-known
resource--flattery."
"Nothing in the world is harder than speaking the
truth and nothing easier than flattery."
"If there’s the hundredth part
of a false note in speaking the truth, it leads to a discord, and that
leads to trouble."
"But if all, to the last note, is false in flattery, it
is just as agreeable, and is heard not without satisfaction."
"It may be
a coarse satisfaction, but still a satisfaction."
"And however coarse the
flattery, at least half will be sure to seem true."
"That’s so for all
stages of development and classes of society."
"A vestal virgin might be
seduced by flattery."
"I can never remember without laughter how I once
seduced a lady who was devoted to her husband, her children, and her
principles."
What fun it was and how little trouble!
"And the lady really
had principles--of her own, anyway."
"All my tactics lay in simply being
utterly annihilated and prostrate before her purity."
"I flattered her
shamelessly, and as soon as I succeeded in getting a pressure of
the hand, even a glance from her, I would reproach myself for having
snatched it by force, and would declare that she had resisted, so that
I could never have gained anything but for my being so unprincipled."
"I maintained that she was so innocent that she could not foresee my
treachery, and yielded to me unconsciously, unawares, and so on."
"In
fact, I triumphed, while my lady remained firmly convinced that she was
innocent, chaste, and faithful to all her duties and obligations and
had succumbed quite by accident."
"And how angry she was with me when I
explained to her at last that it was my sincere conviction that she was
just as eager as I."
"Poor Marfa Petrovna was awfully weak on the side of
flattery, and if I had only cared to, I might have had all her property
settled on me during her lifetime."
"(I am drinking an awful lot of wine
now and talking too much.)"
"I hope you won’t be angry if I mention now
that I was beginning to produce the same effect on Avdotya Romanovna."
But I was stupid and impatient and spoiled it all.
"Avdotya Romanovna had
several times--and one time in particular--been greatly displeased by
the expression of my eyes, would you believe it?"
"There was sometimes a
light in them which frightened her and grew stronger and stronger and
more unguarded till it was hateful to her."
"No need to go into detail,
but we parted."
There I acted stupidly again.
"I fell to jeering in the
coarsest way at all such propaganda and efforts to convert me; Parasha
came on to the scene again, and not she alone; in fact there was a
tremendous to-do."
"Ah, Rodion Romanovitch, if you could only see how your
sister’s eyes can flash sometimes!"
"Never mind my being drunk at this
moment and having had a whole glass of wine."
I am speaking the truth.
"I assure you that this glance has haunted my dreams; the very rustle of
her dress was more than I could stand at last."
"I really began to think
that I might become epileptic."
"I could never have believed that I could
be moved to such a frenzy."
"It was essential, indeed, to be reconciled,
but by then it was impossible."
And imagine what I did then!
"To what
a pitch of stupidity a man can be brought by frenzy!"
"Never undertake
anything in a frenzy, Rodion Romanovitch."
"I reflected that Avdotya
Romanovna was after all a beggar (ach, excuse me, that’s not the word...
but does it matter if it expresses the meaning?"
"), that she lived by
her work, that she had her mother and you to keep (ach, hang it, you
are frowning again), and I resolved to offer her all my money--thirty
thousand roubles I could have realised then--if she would run away with
me here, to Petersburg."
"Of course I should have vowed eternal love,
rapture, and so on."
"Do you know, I was so wild about her at that time
that if she had told me to poison Marfa Petrovna or to cut her throat
and to marry herself, it would have been done at once!"
"But it ended in
the catastrophe of which you know already."
"You can fancy how frantic I
was when I heard that Marfa Petrovna had got hold of that scoundrelly
attorney, Luzhin, and had almost made a match between them--which would
really have been just the same thing as I was proposing."
Wouldn’t it?
Wouldn’t it?
"I notice that you’ve begun to be very attentive... you
interesting young man....”

Svidrigaïlov struck the table with his fist impatiently."
He was flushed.
"Raskolnikov saw clearly that the glass or glass and a half of champagne
that he had sipped almost unconsciously was affecting him--and he
resolved to take advantage of the opportunity."
"He felt very suspicious
of Svidrigaïlov."
"“Well, after what you have said, I am fully convinced that you have
come to Petersburg with designs on my sister,” he said directly to
Svidrigaïlov, in order to irritate him further."
"“Oh, nonsense,” said Svidrigaïlov, seeming to rouse himself."
"“Why, I
told you... besides your sister can’t endure me.”

“Yes, I am certain that she can’t, but that’s not the point.”

“Are you so sure that she can’t?” Svidrigaïlov screwed up his eyes and
smiled mockingly."
"“You are right, she doesn’t love me, but you can
never be sure of what has passed between husband and wife or lover and
mistress."
"There’s always a little corner which remains a secret to
the world and is only known to those two."
"Will you answer for it that
Avdotya Romanovna regarded me with aversion?”

“From some words you’ve dropped, I notice that you still have
designs--and of course evil ones--on Dounia and mean to carry them out
promptly.”

“What, have I dropped words like that?” Svidrigaïlov asked in naïve
dismay, taking not the slightest notice of the epithet bestowed on his
designs."
"“Why, you are dropping them even now."
Why are you so frightened?
"What
are you so afraid of now?”

“Me--afraid?"
Afraid of you?
"You have rather to be afraid of me, _cher
ami_."
"But what nonsense.... I’ve drunk too much though, I see that."
"I
was almost saying too much again."
Damn the wine!
Hi!
"there, water!”

He snatched up the champagne bottle and flung it without ceremony out of
the window."
Philip brought the water.
"“That’s all nonsense!” said Svidrigaïlov, wetting a towel and putting it
to his head."
"“But I can answer you in one word and annihilate all your
suspicions."
"Do you know that I am going to get married?”

“You told me so before.”

“Did I?"
I’ve forgotten.
"But I couldn’t have told you so for certain for
I had not even seen my betrothed; I only meant to."
"But now I really
have a betrothed and it’s a settled thing, and if it weren’t that I have
business that can’t be put off, I would have taken you to see them
at once, for I should like to ask your advice."
"Ach, hang it, only ten
minutes left!"
"See, look at the watch."
"But I must tell you, for it’s an
interesting story, my marriage, in its own way."
Where are you off to?
"Going again?”

“No, I’m not going away now.”

“Not at all?"
We shall see.
"I’ll take you there, I’ll show you my
betrothed, only not now."
For you’ll soon have to be off.
"You have to go
to the right and I to the left."
"Do you know that Madame Resslich, the
woman I am lodging with now, eh?"
"I know what you’re thinking, that she’s
the woman whose girl they say drowned herself in the winter."
"Come, are
you listening?"
She arranged it all for me.
"You’re bored, she said,
you want something to fill up your time."
"For, you know, I am a gloomy,
depressed person."
Do you think I’m light-hearted?
"No, I’m gloomy."
"I do
no harm, but sit in a corner without speaking a word for three days at a
time."
"And that Resslich is a sly hussy, I tell you."
"I know what she has
got in her mind; she thinks I shall get sick of it, abandon my wife and
depart, and she’ll get hold of her and make a profit out of her--in our
class, of course, or higher."
"She told me the father was a broken-down
retired official, who has been sitting in a chair for the last three
years with his legs paralysed."
"The mamma, she said, was a sensible
woman."
"There is a son serving in the provinces, but he doesn’t help;
there is a daughter, who is married, but she doesn’t visit them."
"And
they’ve two little nephews on their hands, as though their own children
were not enough, and they’ve taken from school their youngest daughter,
a girl who’ll be sixteen in another month, so that then she can be
married."
She was for me.
We went there.
How funny it was!
"I present
myself--a landowner, a widower, of a well-known name, with connections,
with a fortune."
What if I am fifty and she is not sixteen?
"Who thinks
of that?"
"But it’s fascinating, isn’t it?"
"It is fascinating, ha-ha!"
"You
should have seen how I talked to the papa and mamma."
"It was worth paying
to have seen me at that moment."
"She comes in, curtseys, you can fancy,
still in a short frock--an unopened bud!"
"Flushing like a sunset--she had
been told, no doubt."
"I don’t know how you feel about female faces, but
to my mind these sixteen years, these childish eyes, shyness and tears
of bashfulness are better than beauty; and she is a perfect little
picture, too."
"Fair hair in little curls, like a lamb’s, full little rosy
lips, tiny feet, a charmer!..."
"Well, we made friends."
"I told them I was
in a hurry owing to domestic circumstances, and the next day, that is
the day before yesterday, we were betrothed."
"When I go now I take her on
my knee at once and keep her there.... Well, she flushes like a sunset
and I kiss her every minute."
"Her mamma of course impresses on her that
this is her husband and that this must be so."
It’s simply delicious!
"The
present betrothed condition is perhaps better than marriage."
"Here you
have what is called _la nature et la vérité_, ha-ha!"
"I’ve talked to her
twice, she is far from a fool."
"Sometimes she steals a look at me that
positively scorches me."
Her face is like Raphael’s Madonna.
"You know,
the Sistine Madonna’s face has something fantastic in it, the face
of mournful religious ecstasy."
Haven’t you noticed it?
"Well, she’s
something in that line."
"The day after we’d been betrothed, I bought her
presents to the value of fifteen hundred roubles--a set of diamonds and
another of pearls and a silver dressing-case as large as this, with all
sorts of things in it, so that even my Madonna’s face glowed."
"I sat her
on my knee, yesterday, and I suppose rather too unceremoniously--she
flushed crimson and the tears started, but she didn’t want to show it."
"We were left alone, she suddenly flung herself on my neck (for the first
time of her own accord), put her little arms round me, kissed me, and
vowed that she would be an obedient, faithful, and good wife, would make
me happy, would devote all her life, every minute of her life, would
sacrifice everything, everything, and that all she asks in return is
my _respect_, and that she wants ‘nothing, nothing more from me, no
presents.’ You’ll admit that to hear such a confession, alone, from an
angel of sixteen in a muslin frock, with little curls, with a flush
of maiden shyness in her cheeks and tears of enthusiasm in her eyes is
rather fascinating!"
Isn’t it fascinating?
"It’s worth paying for, isn’t
it?"
"Well... listen, we’ll go to see my betrothed, only not just now!”

“The fact is this monstrous difference in age and development excites
your sensuality!"
"Will you really make such a marriage?”

“Why, of course."
"Everyone thinks of himself, and he lives most gaily who
knows best how to deceive himself."
Ha-ha!
"But why are you so keen about
virtue?"
"Have mercy on me, my good friend."
I am a sinful man.
"Ha-ha-ha!”

“But you have provided for the children of Katerina Ivanovna."
"Though...
though you had your own reasons...."
"I understand it all now.”

“I am always fond of children, very fond of them,” laughed Svidrigaïlov."
“I can tell you one curious instance of it.
"The first day I came here I
visited various haunts, after seven years I simply rushed at them."
"You
probably notice that I am not in a hurry to renew acquaintance with my
old friends."
I shall do without them as long as I can.
"Do you know, when
I was with Marfa Petrovna in the country, I was haunted by the thought
of these places where anyone who knows his way about can find a great
deal."
"Yes, upon my soul!"
"The peasants have vodka, the educated young
people, shut out from activity, waste themselves in impossible dreams
and visions and are crippled by theories; Jews have sprung up and are
amassing money, and all the rest give themselves up to debauchery."
"From
the first hour the town reeked of its familiar odours."
"I chanced to be
in a frightful den--I like my dens dirty--it was a dance, so called, and
there was a _cancan_ such as I never saw in my day."
"Yes, there you
have progress."
"All of a sudden I saw a little girl of thirteen, nicely
dressed, dancing with a specialist in that line, with another one
_vis-à-vis_."
Her mother was sitting on a chair by the wall.
"You can’t
fancy what a _cancan_ that was!"
"The girl was ashamed, blushed, at
last felt insulted, and began to cry."
"Her partner seized her and began
whirling her round and performing before her; everyone laughed and--I
like your public, even the _cancan_ public--they laughed and shouted,
‘Serves her right--serves her right!"
"Shouldn’t bring children!’ Well,
it’s not my business whether that consoling reflection was logical or
not."
"I at once fixed on my plan, sat down by the mother, and began by
saying that I too was a stranger and that people here were ill-bred and
that they couldn’t distinguish decent folks and treat them with respect,
gave her to understand that I had plenty of money, offered to take them
home in my carriage."
I took them home and got to know them.
"They were
lodging in a miserable little hole and had only just arrived from the
country."
"She told me that she and her daughter could only regard my
acquaintance as an honour."
"I found out that they had nothing of their
own and had come to town upon some legal business."
"I proffered my
services and money."
"I learnt that they had gone to the dancing saloon
by mistake, believing that it was a genuine dancing class."
"I offered to
assist in the young girl’s education in French and dancing."
"My offer was
accepted with enthusiasm as an honour--and we are still friendly...."
"If
you like, we’ll go and see them, only not just now.”

“Stop!"
"Enough of your vile, nasty anecdotes, depraved vile, sensual
man!”

“Schiller, you are a regular Schiller!"
"_O la vertu va-t-elle se nicher?_
But you know I shall tell you these things on purpose, for the pleasure
of hearing your outcries!”

“I dare say."
"I can see I am ridiculous myself,” muttered Raskolnikov
angrily."
"Svidrigaïlov laughed heartily; finally he called Philip, paid his bill,
and began getting up."
"“I say, but I am drunk, _assez causé_,” he said."
"“It’s been a pleasure.”

“I should rather think it must be a pleasure!” cried Raskolnikov,
getting up."
"“No doubt it is a pleasure for a worn-out profligate to
describe such adventures with a monstrous project of the same sort in
his mind--especially under such circumstances and to such a man as
me.... It’s stimulating!”

“Well, if you come to that,” Svidrigaïlov answered, scrutinising
Raskolnikov with some surprise, “if you come to that, you are a thorough
cynic yourself."
"You’ve plenty to make you so, anyway."
"You can understand
a great deal... and you can do a great deal too."
But enough.
"I sincerely
regret not having had more talk with you, but I shan’t lose sight of
you.... Only wait a bit.”

Svidrigaïlov walked out of the restaurant."
"Raskolnikov walked out after
him."
"Svidrigaïlov was not however very drunk, the wine had affected him
for a moment, but it was passing off every minute."
"He was preoccupied
with something of importance and was frowning."
"He was apparently excited
and uneasy in anticipation of something."
"His manner to Raskolnikov had
changed during the last few minutes, and he was ruder and more sneering
every moment."
"Raskolnikov noticed all this, and he too was uneasy."
"He
became very suspicious of Svidrigaïlov and resolved to follow him."
They came out on to the pavement.
"“You go to the right, and I to the left, or if you like, the other way."
"Only _adieu, mon plaisir_, may we meet again.”

And he walked to the right towards the Hay Market."
"CHAPTER V

Raskolnikov walked after him."
"“What’s this?” cried Svidrigaïlov turning round, “I thought I said...”

“It means that I am not going to lose sight of you now.”

“What?”

Both stood still and gazed at one another, as though measuring their
strength."
"“From all your half tipsy stories,” Raskolnikov observed harshly, “I am
_positive_ that you have not given up your designs on my sister, but
are pursuing them more actively than ever."
"I have learnt that my sister
received a letter this morning."
"You have hardly been able to sit still
all this time.... You may have unearthed a wife on the way, but that
means nothing."
"I should like to make certain myself.”

Raskolnikov could hardly have said himself what he wanted and of what he
wished to make certain."
“Upon my word!
"I’ll call the police!”

“Call away!”

Again they stood for a minute facing each other."
"At last Svidrigaïlov’s
face changed."
"Having satisfied himself that Raskolnikov was not
frightened at his threat, he assumed a mirthful and friendly air."
“What a fellow!
"I purposely refrained from referring to your affair,
though I am devoured by curiosity."
It’s a fantastic affair.
"I’ve put it
off till another time, but you’re enough to rouse the dead.... Well, let
us go, only I warn you beforehand I am only going home for a moment,
to get some money; then I shall lock up the flat, take a cab and go to
spend the evening at the Islands."
"Now, now are you going to follow me?”

“I’m coming to your lodgings, not to see you but Sofya Semyonovna, to
say I’m sorry not to have been at the funeral.”

“That’s as you like, but Sofya Semyonovna is not at home."
"She has taken
the three children to an old lady of high rank, the patroness of some
orphan asylums, whom I used to know years ago."
"I charmed the old lady by
depositing a sum of money with her to provide for the three children of
Katerina Ivanovna and subscribing to the institution as well."
"I told her
too the story of Sofya Semyonovna in full detail, suppressing nothing."
It produced an indescribable effect on her.
"That’s why Sofya Semyonovna
has been invited to call to-day at the X."
"Hotel where the lady is
staying for the time.”

“No matter, I’ll come all the same.”

“As you like, it’s nothing to me, but I won’t come with you; here we are
at home."
"By the way, I am convinced that you regard me with suspicion
just because I have shown such delicacy and have not so far troubled
you with questions... you understand?"
"It struck you as extraordinary; I
don’t mind betting it’s that."
"Well, it teaches one to show delicacy!”

“And to listen at doors!”

“Ah, that’s it, is it?” laughed Svidrigaïlov."
"“Yes, I should have been
surprised if you had let that pass after all that has happened."
Ha-ha!
"Though I did understand something of the pranks you had been up to and
were telling Sofya Semyonovna about, what was the meaning of it?"
"Perhaps
I am quite behind the times and can’t understand."
"For goodness’ sake,
explain it, my dear boy."
"Expound the latest theories!”

“You couldn’t have heard anything."
"You’re making it all up!”

“But I’m not talking about that (though I did hear something)."
"No, I’m
talking of the way you keep sighing and groaning now."
"The Schiller in
you is in revolt every moment, and now you tell me not to listen at
doors."
"If that’s how you feel, go and inform the police that you had
this mischance: you made a little mistake in your theory."
"But if you are
convinced that one mustn’t listen at doors, but one may murder old women
at one’s pleasure, you’d better be off to America and make haste."
"Run,
young man!"
There may still be time.
I’m speaking sincerely.
"Haven’t you
the money?"
"I’ll give you the fare.”

“I’m not thinking of that at all,” Raskolnikov interrupted with disgust."
"“I understand (but don’t put yourself out, don’t discuss it if you don’t
want to)."
"I understand the questions you are worrying over--moral ones,
aren’t they?"
Duties of citizen and man?
Lay them all aside.
"They are
nothing to you now, ha-ha!"
You’ll say you are still a man and a citizen.
If so you ought not to have got into this coil.
"It’s no use taking up a
job you are not fit for."
"Well, you’d better shoot yourself, or don’t you
want to?”

“You seem trying to enrage me, to make me leave you.”

“What a queer fellow!"
But here we are.
Welcome to the staircase.
"You
see, that’s the way to Sofya Semyonovna."
"Look, there is no one at home."
Don’t you believe me?
Ask Kapernaumov.
She leaves the key with him.
"Here
is Madame de Kapernaumov herself."
"Hey, what?"
She is rather deaf.
"Has she
gone out?"
Where?
Did you hear?
"She is not in and won’t be till late in
the evening probably."
"Well, come to my room; you wanted to come and see
me, didn’t you?"
Here we are.
Madame Resslich’s not at home.
"She is a
woman who is always busy, an excellent woman I assure you.... She might
have been of use to you if you had been a little more sensible."
"Now,
see!"
"I take this five-per-cent bond out of the bureau--see what a lot
I’ve got of them still--this one will be turned into cash to-day."
"I
mustn’t waste any more time."
"The bureau is locked, the flat is locked,
and here we are again on the stairs."
Shall we take a cab?
"I’m going to
the Islands."
Would you like a lift?
I’ll take this carriage.
"Ah, you
refuse?"
You are tired of it!
Come for a drive!
"I believe it will come on
to rain."
"Never mind, we’ll put down the hood....”

Svidrigaïlov was already in the carriage."
"Raskolnikov decided that his
suspicions were at least for that moment unjust."
"Without answering a
word he turned and walked back towards the Hay Market."
"If he had only
turned round on his way he might have seen Svidrigaïlov get out not a
hundred paces off, dismiss the cab and walk along the pavement."
"But he
had turned the corner and could see nothing."
"Intense disgust drew him
away from Svidrigaïlov."
"“To think that I could for one instant have looked for help from that
coarse brute, that depraved sensualist and blackguard!” he cried."
"Raskolnikov’s judgment was uttered too lightly and hastily: there was
something about Svidrigaïlov which gave him a certain original, even a
mysterious character."
"As concerned his sister, Raskolnikov was convinced
that Svidrigaïlov would not leave her in peace."
"But it was too tiresome
and unbearable to go on thinking and thinking about this."
"When he was alone, he had not gone twenty paces before he sank, as
usual, into deep thought."
"On the bridge he stood by the railing and
began gazing at the water."
And his sister was standing close by him.
"He met her at the entrance to the bridge, but passed by without seeing
her."
"Dounia had never met him like this in the street before and was
struck with dismay."
"She stood still and did not know whether to call
to him or not."
"Suddenly she saw Svidrigaïlov coming quickly from the
direction of the Hay Market."
He seemed to be approaching cautiously.
"He did not go on to the
bridge, but stood aside on the pavement, doing all he could to avoid
Raskolnikov’s seeing him."
"He had observed Dounia for some time and had
been making signs to her."
"She fancied he was signalling to beg her not
to speak to her brother, but to come to him."
That was what Dounia did.
"She stole by her brother and went up to
Svidrigaïlov."
"“Let us make haste away,” Svidrigaïlov whispered to her, “I don’t want
Rodion Romanovitch to know of our meeting."
"I must tell you I’ve been
sitting with him in the restaurant close by, where he looked me up and
I had great difficulty in getting rid of him."
"He has somehow heard of
my letter to you and suspects something."
"It wasn’t you who told him, of
course, but if not you, who then?”

“Well, we’ve turned the corner now,” Dounia interrupted, “and my brother
won’t see us."
I have to tell you that I am going no further with you.
Speak to me here.
"You can tell it all in the street.”

“In the first place, I can’t say it in the street; secondly, you must
hear Sofya Semyonovna too; and, thirdly, I will show you some papers....
Oh well, if you won’t agree to come with me, I shall refuse to give
any explanation and go away at once."
"But I beg you not to forget that
a very curious secret of your beloved brother’s is entirely in my
keeping.”

Dounia stood still, hesitating, and looked at Svidrigaïlov with
searching eyes."
“What are you afraid of?” he observed quietly.
"“The town is not the
country."
"And even in the country you did me more harm than I did you.”

“Have you prepared Sofya Semyonovna?”

“No, I have not said a word to her and am not quite certain whether she
is at home now."
But most likely she is.
"She has buried her stepmother
to-day: she is not likely to go visiting on such a day."
"For the time I
don’t want to speak to anyone about it and I half regret having spoken
to you."
"The slightest indiscretion is as bad as betrayal in a thing like
this."
"I live there in that house, we are coming to it."
"That’s the porter
of our house--he knows me very well; you see, he’s bowing; he sees I’m
coming with a lady and no doubt he has noticed your face already and you
will be glad of that if you are afraid of me and suspicious."
"Excuse
my putting things so coarsely."
"I haven’t a flat to myself; Sofya
Semyonovna’s room is next to mine--she lodges in the next flat."
"The
whole floor is let out in lodgings."
Why are you frightened like a child?
"Am I really so terrible?”

Svidrigaïlov’s lips were twisted in a condescending smile; but he was in
no smiling mood."
His heart was throbbing and he could scarcely breathe.
He spoke rather loud to cover his growing excitement.
"But Dounia did not
notice this peculiar excitement, she was so irritated by his remark that
she was frightened of him like a child and that he was so terrible to
her."
"“Though I know that you are not a man... of honour, I am not in the
least afraid of you."
"Lead the way,” she said with apparent composure,
but her face was very pale."
Svidrigaïlov stopped at Sonia’s room.
“Allow me to inquire whether she is at home.... She is not.
"How
unfortunate!"
But I know she may come quite soon.
"If she’s gone out, it
can only be to see a lady about the orphans."
"Their mother is dead....
I’ve been meddling and making arrangements for them."
"If Sofya Semyonovna
does not come back in ten minutes, I will send her to you, to-day if
you like."
This is my flat.
These are my two rooms.
"Madame Resslich,
my landlady, has the next room."
"Now, look this way."
"I will show you
my chief piece of evidence: this door from my bedroom leads into two
perfectly empty rooms, which are to let."
"Here they are... You must look
into them with some attention.”

Svidrigaïlov occupied two fairly large furnished rooms."
"Dounia was
looking about her mistrustfully, but saw nothing special in the
furniture or position of the rooms."
"Yet there was something to observe,
for instance, that Svidrigaïlov’s flat was exactly between two sets of
almost uninhabited apartments."
"His rooms were not entered directly
from the passage, but through the landlady’s two almost empty rooms."
"Unlocking a door leading out of his bedroom, Svidrigaïlov showed Dounia
the two empty rooms that were to let."
"Dounia stopped in the doorway, not
knowing what she was called to look upon, but Svidrigaïlov hastened to
explain."
"“Look here, at this second large room."
"Notice that door, it’s locked."
"By the door stands a chair, the only one in the two rooms."
"I brought it
from my rooms so as to listen more conveniently."
"Just the other side of
the door is Sofya Semyonovna’s table; she sat there talking to Rodion
Romanovitch."
"And I sat here listening on two successive evenings, for
two hours each time--and of course I was able to learn something, what
do you think?”

“You listened?”

“Yes, I did."
"Now come back to my room; we can’t sit down here.”

He brought Avdotya Romanovna back into his sitting-room and offered her
a chair."
"He sat down at the opposite side of the table, at least seven
feet from her, but probably there was the same glow in his eyes which
had once frightened Dounia so much."
"She shuddered and once more looked
about her distrustfully."
"It was an involuntary gesture; she evidently
did not wish to betray her uneasiness."
"But the secluded position of
Svidrigaïlov’s lodging had suddenly struck her."
"She wanted to ask
whether his landlady at least were at home, but pride kept her from
asking."
"Moreover, she had another trouble in her heart incomparably
greater than fear for herself."
She was in great distress.
"“Here is your letter,” she said, laying it on the table."
"“Can it be true
what you write?"
"You hint at a crime committed, you say, by my brother."
You hint at it too clearly; you daren’t deny it now.
"I must tell you
that I’d heard of this stupid story before you wrote and don’t believe a
word of it."
It’s a disgusting and ridiculous suspicion.
"I know the story
and why and how it was invented."
You can have no proofs.
"You promised to
prove it."
Speak!
But let me warn you that I don’t believe you!
"I don’t
believe you!”

Dounia said this, speaking hurriedly, and for an instant the colour
rushed to her face."
"“If you didn’t believe it, how could you risk coming alone to my rooms?"
Why have you come?
"Simply from curiosity?”

“Don’t torment me."
"Speak, speak!”

“There’s no denying that you are a brave girl."
"Upon my word, I thought
you would have asked Mr. Razumihin to escort you here."
"But he was not
with you nor anywhere near."
I was on the look-out.
"It’s spirited of
you, it proves you wanted to spare Rodion Romanovitch."
"But everything
is divine in you.... About your brother, what am I to say to you?"
"You’ve
just seen him yourself."
"What did you think of him?”

“Surely that’s not the only thing you are building on?”

“No, not on that, but on his own words."
"He came here on two successive
evenings to see Sofya Semyonovna."
I’ve shown you where they sat.
"He made
a full confession to her."
He is a murderer.
"He killed an old woman, a
pawnbroker, with whom he had pawned things himself."
"He killed her sister
too, a pedlar woman called Lizaveta, who happened to come in while he
was murdering her sister."
"He killed them with an axe he brought with
him."
He murdered them to rob them and he did rob them.
"He took money and
various things...."
"He told all this, word for word, to Sofya Semyonovna,
the only person who knows his secret."
"But she has had no share by word
or deed in the murder; she was as horrified at it as you are now."
"Don’t
be anxious, she won’t betray him.”

“It cannot be,” muttered Dounia, with white lips."
She gasped for breath.
“It cannot be.
"There was not the slightest cause, no sort of ground....
It’s a lie, a lie!”

“He robbed her, that was the cause, he took money and things."
"It’s true
that by his own admission he made no use of the money or things, but hid
them under a stone, where they are now."
"But that was because he dared
not make use of them.”

“But how could he steal, rob?"
"How could he dream of it?” cried Dounia,
and she jumped up from the chair."
"“Why, you know him, and you’ve seen
him, can he be a thief?”

She seemed to be imploring Svidrigaïlov; she had entirely forgotten her
fear."
"“There are thousands and millions of combinations and possibilities,
Avdotya Romanovna."
"A thief steals and knows he is a scoundrel, but I’ve
heard of a gentleman who broke open the mail."
"Who knows, very likely he
thought he was doing a gentlemanly thing!"
"Of course I should not have
believed it myself if I’d been told of it as you have, but I believe my
own ears."
"He explained all the causes of it to Sofya Semyonovna too, but
she did not believe her ears at first, yet she believed her own eyes at
last.”

“What... were the causes?”

“It’s a long story, Avdotya Romanovna."
"Here’s... how shall I tell
you?--A theory of a sort, the same one by which I for instance consider
that a single misdeed is permissible if the principal aim is right, a
solitary wrongdoing and hundreds of good deeds!"
"It’s galling too, of
course, for a young man of gifts and overweening pride to know that if
he had, for instance, a paltry three thousand, his whole career, his
whole future would be differently shaped and yet not to have that three
thousand."
"Add to that, nervous irritability from hunger, from lodging
in a hole, from rags, from a vivid sense of the charm of his social
position and his sister’s and mother’s position too."
"Above all, vanity,
pride and vanity, though goodness knows he may have good qualities
too...."
"I am not blaming him, please don’t think it; besides, it’s not
my business."
"A special little theory came in too--a theory of a
sort--dividing mankind, you see, into material and superior persons,
that is persons to whom the law does not apply owing to their
superiority, who make laws for the rest of mankind, the material, that
is."
"It’s all right as a theory, _une théorie comme une autre_."
"Napoleon
attracted him tremendously, that is, what affected him was that a
great many men of genius have not hesitated at wrongdoing, but have
overstepped the law without thinking about it."
"He seems to have fancied
that he was a genius too--that is, he was convinced of it for a time."
"He
has suffered a great deal and is still suffering from the idea that he
could make a theory, but was incapable of boldly overstepping the law,
and so he is not a man of genius."
"And that’s humiliating for a young man
of any pride, in our day especially....”

“But remorse?"
You deny him any moral feeling then?
"Is he like that?”

“Ah, Avdotya Romanovna, everything is in a muddle now; not that it was
ever in very good order."
"Russians in general are broad in their ideas,
Avdotya Romanovna, broad like their land and exceedingly disposed to
the fantastic, the chaotic."
"But it’s a misfortune to be broad without
a special genius."
"Do you remember what a lot of talk we had together on
this subject, sitting in the evenings on the terrace after supper?"
"Why,
you used to reproach me with breadth!"
"Who knows, perhaps we were talking
at the very time when he was lying here thinking over his plan."
"There
are no sacred traditions amongst us, especially in the educated class,
Avdotya Romanovna."
"At the best someone will make them up somehow for
himself out of books or from some old chronicle."
"But those are for the
most part the learned and all old fogeys, so that it would be almost
ill-bred in a man of society."
"You know my opinions in general, though."
"I
never blame anyone."
"I do nothing at all, I persevere in that."
"But
we’ve talked of this more than once before."
"I was so happy indeed as to
interest you in my opinions.... You are very pale, Avdotya Romanovna.”

“I know his theory."
"I read that article of his about men to whom all is
permitted."
"Razumihin brought it to me.”

“Mr."
Razumihin?
Your brother’s article?
In a magazine?
"Is there such an
article?"
I didn’t know.
It must be interesting.
"But where are you going,
Avdotya Romanovna?”

“I want to see Sofya Semyonovna,” Dounia articulated faintly."
"“How do I
go to her?"
"She has come in, perhaps."
I must see her at once.
"Perhaps
she...”

Avdotya Romanovna could not finish."
Her breath literally failed her.
"“Sofya Semyonovna will not be back till night, at least I believe not."
"She was to have been back at once, but if not, then she will not be in
till quite late.”

“Ah, then you are lying!"
"I see... you were lying... lying all the
time...."
I don’t believe you!
"I don’t believe you!” cried Dounia,
completely losing her head."
"Almost fainting, she sank on to a chair which Svidrigaïlov made haste to
give her."
"“Avdotya Romanovna, what is it?"
Control yourself!
Here is some water.
"Drink a little....”

He sprinkled some water over her."
Dounia shuddered and came to herself.
"“It has acted violently,” Svidrigaïlov muttered to himself, frowning."
"“Avdotya Romanovna, calm yourself!"
"Believe me, he has friends."
"We will
save him."
Would you like me to take him abroad?
"I have money, I can get
a ticket in three days."
"And as for the murder, he will do all sorts of
good deeds yet, to atone for it."
Calm yourself.
"He may become a great
man yet."
"Well, how are you?"
"How do you feel?”

“Cruel man!"
To be able to jeer at it!
"Let me go...”

“Where are you going?”

“To him."
Where is he?
Do you know?
Why is this door locked?
"We came in
at that door and now it is locked."
"When did you manage to lock it?”

“We couldn’t be shouting all over the flat on such a subject."
"I am far
from jeering; it’s simply that I’m sick of talking like this."
"But how
can you go in such a state?"
Do you want to betray him?
"You will drive
him to fury, and he will give himself up."
"Let me tell you, he is already
being watched; they are already on his track."
"You will simply be giving
him away."
Wait a little: I saw him and was talking to him just now.
"He
can still be saved."
"Wait a bit, sit down; let us think it over together."
"I asked you to come in order to discuss it alone with you and to
consider it thoroughly."
"But do sit down!”

“How can you save him?"
"Can he really be saved?”

Dounia sat down."
Svidrigaïlov sat down beside her.
"“It all depends on you, on you, on you alone,” he began with glowing
eyes, almost in a whisper and hardly able to utter the words for
emotion."
Dounia drew back from him in alarm.
He too was trembling all over.
"“You... one word from you, and he is saved."
I... I’ll save him.
"I have
money and friends."
I’ll send him away at once.
"I’ll get a passport,
two passports, one for him and one for me."
"I have friends... capable
people...."
"If you like, I’ll take a passport for you... for your
mother.... What do you want with Razumihin?"
I love you too....
"I love
you beyond everything.... Let me kiss the hem of your dress, let me, let
me...."
The very rustle of it is too much for me.
"Tell me, ‘do that,’
and I’ll do it."
I’ll do everything.
I will do the impossible.
"What you
believe, I will believe."
I’ll do anything--anything!
"Don’t, don’t look
at me like that."
"Do you know that you are killing me?...”

He was almost beginning to rave.... Something seemed suddenly to go to
his head."
Dounia jumped up and rushed to the door.
“Open it!
"Open it!” she called, shaking the door."
“Open it!
"Is there no
one there?”

Svidrigaïlov got up and came to himself."
"His still trembling lips slowly
broke into an angry mocking smile."
"“There is no one at home,” he said quietly and emphatically."
"“The
landlady has gone out, and it’s waste of time to shout like that."
"You
are only exciting yourself uselessly.”

“Where is the key?"
"Open the door at once, at once, base man!”

“I have lost the key and cannot find it.”

“This is an outrage,” cried Dounia, turning pale as death."
"She rushed
to the furthest corner, where she made haste to barricade herself with a
little table."
"She did not scream, but she fixed her eyes on her tormentor and watched
every movement he made."
Svidrigaïlov remained standing at the other end of the room facing her.
"He was positively composed, at least in appearance, but his face was
pale as before."
The mocking smile did not leave his face.
"“You spoke of outrage just now, Avdotya Romanovna."
"In that case you
may be sure I’ve taken measures."
Sofya Semyonovna is not at home.
"The
Kapernaumovs are far away--there are five locked rooms between."
"I am at
least twice as strong as you are and I have nothing to fear, besides."
For you could not complain afterwards.
"You surely would not be willing
actually to betray your brother?"
"Besides, no one would believe you."
"How
should a girl have come alone to visit a solitary man in his lodgings?"
"So that even if you do sacrifice your brother, you could prove nothing."
"It is very difficult to prove an assault, Avdotya Romanovna.”

“Scoundrel!” whispered Dounia indignantly."
"“As you like, but observe I was only speaking by way of a general
proposition."
"It’s my personal conviction that you are perfectly
right--violence is hateful."
"I only spoke to show you that you need have
no remorse even if... you were willing to save your brother of your
own accord, as I suggest to you."
"You would be simply submitting to
circumstances, to violence, in fact, if we must use that word."
"Think
about it."
Your brother’s and your mother’s fate are in your hands.
"I
will be your slave... all my life..."
"I will wait here.”

Svidrigaïlov sat down on the sofa about eight steps from Dounia."
"She had
not the slightest doubt now of his unbending determination."
"Besides, she
knew him."
"Suddenly she pulled out of her pocket a revolver, cocked it
and laid it in her hand on the table."
Svidrigaïlov jumped up.
“Aha!
"So that’s it, is it?” he cried, surprised but smiling maliciously."
"“Well, that completely alters the aspect of affairs."
"You’ve made things
wonderfully easier for me, Avdotya Romanovna."
"But where did you get the
revolver?"
Was it Mr. Razumihin?
"Why, it’s my revolver, an old friend!"
And how I’ve hunted for it!
"The shooting lessons I’ve given you in the
country have not been thrown away.”

“It’s not your revolver, it belonged to Marfa Petrovna, whom you killed,
wretch!"
There was nothing of yours in her house.
"I took it when I began
to suspect what you were capable of."
"If you dare to advance one step, I
swear I’ll kill you.” She was frantic."
“But your brother?
"I ask from curiosity,” said Svidrigaïlov, still
standing where he was."
"“Inform, if you want to!"
Don’t stir!
Don’t come nearer!
I’ll shoot!
"You
poisoned your wife, I know; you are a murderer yourself!” She held the
revolver ready."
"“Are you so positive I poisoned Marfa Petrovna?”

“You did!"
You hinted it yourself; you talked to me of poison....
"I know
you went to get it... you had it in readiness...."
It was your doing....
"It must have been your doing.... Scoundrel!”

“Even if that were true, it would have been for your sake... you would
have been the cause.”

“You are lying!"
"I hated you always, always....”

“Oho, Avdotya Romanovna!"
"You seem to have forgotten how you softened
to me in the heat of propaganda."
I saw it in your eyes.
"Do you remember
that moonlight night, when the nightingale was singing?”

“That’s a lie,” there was a flash of fury in Dounia’s eyes, “that’s a
lie and a libel!”

“A lie?"
"Well, if you like, it’s a lie."
I made it up.
"Women ought not
to be reminded of such things,” he smiled."
"“I know you will shoot, you
pretty wild creature."
"Well, shoot away!”

Dounia raised the revolver, and deadly pale, gazed at him, measuring the
distance and awaiting the first movement on his part."
"Her lower lip was
white and quivering and her big black eyes flashed like fire."
"He had
never seen her so handsome."
"The fire glowing in her eyes at the moment
she raised the revolver seemed to kindle him and there was a pang of
anguish in his heart."
He took a step forward and a shot rang out.
"The
bullet grazed his hair and flew into the wall behind."
"He stood still and
laughed softly."
“The wasp has stung me.
She aimed straight at my head.
What’s this?
"Blood?” he pulled out his handkerchief to wipe the blood, which flowed
in a thin stream down his right temple."
"The bullet seemed to have just
grazed the skin."
"Dounia lowered the revolver and looked at Svidrigaïlov not so much in
terror as in a sort of wild amazement."
"She seemed not to understand what
she was doing and what was going on."
"“Well, you missed!"
"Fire again, I’ll wait,” said Svidrigaïlov softly,
still smiling, but gloomily."
"“If you go on like that, I shall have time
to seize you before you cock again.”

Dounia started, quickly cocked the pistol and again raised it."
"“Let me be,” she cried in despair."
“I swear I’ll shoot again.
"I... I’ll
kill you.”

“Well... at three paces you can hardly help it."
"But if you don’t...
then.” His eyes flashed and he took two steps forward."
"Dounia shot
again: it missed fire."
“You haven’t loaded it properly.
"Never mind, you have another charge
there."
"Get it ready, I’ll wait.”

He stood facing her, two paces away, waiting and gazing at her with wild
determination, with feverishly passionate, stubborn, set eyes."
"Dounia
saw that he would sooner die than let her go."
"“And... now, of course she
would kill him, at two paces!” Suddenly she flung away the revolver."
"“She’s dropped it!” said Svidrigaïlov with surprise, and he drew a deep
breath."
"A weight seemed to have rolled from his heart--perhaps not only
the fear of death; indeed he may scarcely have felt it at that moment."
"It was the deliverance from another feeling, darker and more bitter,
which he could not himself have defined."
He went to Dounia and gently put his arm round her waist.
"She did not
resist, but, trembling like a leaf, looked at him with suppliant eyes."
"He tried to say something, but his lips moved without being able to
utter a sound."
"“Let me go,” Dounia implored."
Svidrigaïlov shuddered.
"Her voice now was
quite different."
“Then you don’t love me?” he asked softly.
Dounia shook her head.
“And... and you can’t?
Never?” he whispered in despair.
"“Never!”

There followed a moment of terrible, dumb struggle in the heart of
Svidrigaïlov."
He looked at her with an indescribable gaze.
"Suddenly
he withdrew his arm, turned quickly to the window and stood facing it."
Another moment passed.
"“Here’s the key.”

He took it out of the left pocket of his coat and laid it on the table
behind him, without turning or looking at Dounia."
“Take it!
"Make haste!”

He looked stubbornly out of the window."
"Dounia went up to the table to
take the key."
“Make haste!
"Make haste!” repeated Svidrigaïlov, still without turning
or moving."
"But there seemed a terrible significance in the tone of that
“make haste.”

Dounia understood it, snatched up the key, flew to the door, unlocked it
quickly and rushed out of the room."
"A minute later, beside herself, she
ran out on to the canal bank in the direction of X. Bridge."
Svidrigaïlov remained three minutes standing at the window.
"At last he
slowly turned, looked about him and passed his hand over his forehead."
"A
strange smile contorted his face, a pitiful, sad, weak smile, a smile of
despair."
"The blood, which was already getting dry, smeared his hand."
"He looked angrily at it, then wetted a towel and washed his temple."
"The revolver which Dounia had flung away lay near the door and suddenly
caught his eye."
He picked it up and examined it.
"It was a little pocket
three-barrel revolver of old-fashioned construction."
"There were still
two charges and one capsule left in it."
It could be fired again.
"He
thought a little, put the revolver in his pocket, took his hat and went
out."
"CHAPTER VI

He spent that evening till ten o’clock going from one low haunt to
another."
"Katia too turned up and sang another gutter song, how a certain

“villain and tyrant,”

“began kissing Katia.”

Svidrigaïlov treated Katia and the organ-grinder and some singers and
the waiters and two little clerks."
"He was particularly drawn to these
clerks by the fact that they both had crooked noses, one bent to the
left and the other to the right."
"They took him finally to a pleasure
garden, where he paid for their entrance."
"There was one lanky
three-year-old pine-tree and three bushes in the garden, besides a
“Vauxhall,” which was in reality a drinking-bar where tea too was
served, and there were a few green tables and chairs standing round it."
"A chorus of wretched singers and a drunken but exceedingly depressed
German clown from Munich with a red nose entertained the public."
"The
clerks quarrelled with some other clerks and a fight seemed imminent."
Svidrigaïlov was chosen to decide the dispute.
"He listened to them for
a quarter of an hour, but they shouted so loud that there was no
possibility of understanding them."
"The only fact that seemed certain was
that one of them had stolen something and had even succeeded in
selling it on the spot to a Jew, but would not share the spoil with his
companion."
"Finally it appeared that the stolen object was a teaspoon
belonging to the Vauxhall."
"It was missed and the affair began to seem
troublesome."
"Svidrigaïlov paid for the spoon, got up, and walked out of
the garden."
It was about six o’clock.
"He had not drunk a drop of wine
all this time and had ordered tea more for the sake of appearances than
anything."
It was a dark and stifling evening.
"Threatening storm-clouds came over
the sky about ten o’clock."
"There was a clap of thunder, and the rain
came down like a waterfall."
"The water fell not in drops, but beat on the
earth in streams."
"There were flashes of lightning every minute and each
flash lasted while one could count five."
"Drenched to the skin, he went home, locked himself in, opened the
bureau, took out all his money and tore up two or three papers."
"Then,
putting the money in his pocket, he was about to change his clothes,
but, looking out of the window and listening to the thunder and the
rain, he gave up the idea, took up his hat and went out of the room
without locking the door."
He went straight to Sonia.
She was at home.
She was not alone: the four Kapernaumov children were with her.
"She
was giving them tea."
"She received Svidrigaïlov in respectful silence,
looking wonderingly at his soaking clothes."
"The children all ran away at
once in indescribable terror."
Svidrigaïlov sat down at the table and asked Sonia to sit beside him.
She timidly prepared to listen.
"“I may be going to America, Sofya Semyonovna,” said Svidrigaïlov, “and
as I am probably seeing you for the last time, I have come to make some
arrangements."
"Well, did you see the lady to-day?"
"I know what she said to
you, you need not tell me.” (Sonia made a movement and blushed.)"
"“Those
people have their own way of doing things."
"As to your sisters and your
brother, they are really provided for and the money assigned to them
I’ve put into safe keeping and have received acknowledgments."
"You had
better take charge of the receipts, in case anything happens."
"Here, take
them!"
"Well now, that’s settled."
"Here are three 5-per-cent bonds to the
value of three thousand roubles."
"Take those for yourself, entirely for
yourself, and let that be strictly between ourselves, so that no one
knows of it, whatever you hear."
"You will need the money, for to go on
living in the old way, Sofya Semyonovna, is bad, and besides there is no
need for it now.”

“I am so much indebted to you, and so are the children and my
stepmother,” said Sonia hurriedly, “and if I’ve said so little... please
don’t consider...”

“That’s enough!"
"that’s enough!”

“But as for the money, Arkady Ivanovitch, I am very grateful to you,
but I don’t need it now."
I can always earn my own living.
"Don’t think me
ungrateful."
"If you are so charitable, that money....”

“It’s for you, for you, Sofya Semyonovna, and please don’t waste words
over it."
I haven’t time for it.
You will want it.
"Rodion Romanovitch
has two alternatives: a bullet in the brain or Siberia.” (Sonia looked
wildly at him, and started.)"
"“Don’t be uneasy, I know all about it from
himself and I am not a gossip; I won’t tell anyone."
"It was good advice
when you told him to give himself up and confess."
"It would be much
better for him."
"Well, if it turns out to be Siberia, he will go and
you will follow him."
"That’s so, isn’t it?"
"And if so, you’ll need money."
"You’ll need it for him, do you understand?"
"Giving it to you is the same
as my giving it to him."
"Besides, you promised Amalia Ivanovna to pay
what’s owing."
I heard you.
"How can you undertake such obligations so
heedlessly, Sofya Semyonovna?"
"It was Katerina Ivanovna’s debt and not
yours, so you ought not to have taken any notice of the German woman."
You can’t get through the world like that.
"If you are ever questioned
about me--to-morrow or the day after you will be asked--don’t say
anything about my coming to see you now and don’t show the money to
anyone or say a word about it."
"Well, now good-bye.” (He got up.)"
"“My
greetings to Rodion Romanovitch."
"By the way, you’d better put the money
for the present in Mr. Razumihin’s keeping."
You know Mr. Razumihin?
"Of
course you do."
He’s not a bad fellow.
"Take it to him to-morrow or...
when the time comes."
"And till then, hide it carefully.”

Sonia too jumped up from her chair and looked in dismay at Svidrigaïlov."
"She longed to speak, to ask a question, but for the first moments she
did not dare and did not know how to begin."
"“How can you... how can you be going now, in such rain?”

“Why, be starting for America, and be stopped by rain!"
"Ha, ha!"
"Good-bye,
Sofya Semyonovna, my dear!"
"Live and live long, you will be of use to
others."
By the way... tell Mr. Razumihin I send my greetings to him.
Tell him Arkady Ivanovitch Svidrigaïlov sends his greetings.
"Be sure
to.”

He went out, leaving Sonia in a state of wondering anxiety and vague
apprehension."
"It appeared afterwards that on the same evening, at twenty past eleven,
he made another very eccentric and unexpected visit."
"The rain still
persisted."
"Drenched to the skin, he walked into the little flat where
the parents of his betrothed lived, in Third Street in Vassilyevsky
Island."
"He knocked some time before he was admitted, and his visit
at first caused great perturbation; but Svidrigaïlov could be
very fascinating when he liked, so that the first, and indeed very
intelligent surmise of the sensible parents that Svidrigaïlov had
probably had so much to drink that he did not know what he was doing
vanished immediately."
"The decrepit father was wheeled in to see
Svidrigaïlov by the tender and sensible mother, who as usual began the
conversation with various irrelevant questions."
"She never asked a direct
question, but began by smiling and rubbing her hands and then, if she
were obliged to ascertain something--for instance, when Svidrigaïlov
would like to have the wedding--she would begin by interested and
almost eager questions about Paris and the court life there, and only
by degrees brought the conversation round to Third Street."
"On other
occasions this had of course been very impressive, but this time Arkady
Ivanovitch seemed particularly impatient, and insisted on seeing his
betrothed at once, though he had been informed, to begin with, that she
had already gone to bed."
The girl of course appeared.
"Svidrigaïlov informed her at once that he was obliged by very important
affairs to leave Petersburg for a time, and therefore brought her
fifteen thousand roubles and begged her accept them as a present from
him, as he had long been intending to make her this trifling present
before their wedding."
"The logical connection of the present with his
immediate departure and the absolute necessity of visiting them for that
purpose in pouring rain at midnight was not made clear."
"But it all went
off very well; even the inevitable ejaculations of wonder and regret,
the inevitable questions were extraordinarily few and restrained."
"On the
other hand, the gratitude expressed was most glowing and was reinforced
by tears from the most sensible of mothers."
"Svidrigaïlov got up,
laughed, kissed his betrothed, patted her cheek, declared he would soon
come back, and noticing in her eyes, together with childish curiosity, a
sort of earnest dumb inquiry, reflected and kissed her again, though
he felt sincere anger inwardly at the thought that his present would be
immediately locked up in the keeping of the most sensible of mothers."
"He
went away, leaving them all in a state of extraordinary excitement, but
the tender mamma, speaking quietly in a half whisper, settled some of
the most important of their doubts, concluding that Svidrigaïlov was
a great man, a man of great affairs and connections and of great
wealth--there was no knowing what he had in his mind."
"He would start
off on a journey and give away money just as the fancy took him, so that
there was nothing surprising about it."
"Of course it was strange that he
was wet through, but Englishmen, for instance, are even more eccentric,
and all these people of high society didn’t think of what was said of
them and didn’t stand on ceremony."
"Possibly, indeed, he came like that
on purpose to show that he was not afraid of anyone."
"Above all, not a
word should be said about it, for God knows what might come of it, and
the money must be locked up, and it was most fortunate that Fedosya, the
cook, had not left the kitchen."
"And above all not a word must be said
to that old cat, Madame Resslich, and so on and so on."
"They sat up
whispering till two o’clock, but the girl went to bed much earlier,
amazed and rather sorrowful."
"Svidrigaïlov meanwhile, exactly at midnight, crossed the bridge on the
way back to the mainland."
"The rain had ceased and there was a roaring
wind."
"He began shivering, and for one moment he gazed at the black
waters of the Little Neva with a look of special interest, even inquiry."
"But he soon felt it very cold, standing by the water; he turned and
went towards Y."
Prospect.
"He walked along that endless street for a long
time, almost half an hour, more than once stumbling in the dark on the
wooden pavement, but continually looking for something on the right side
of the street."
"He had noticed passing through this street lately that
there was a hotel somewhere towards the end, built of wood, but fairly
large, and its name he remembered was something like Adrianople."
"He was
not mistaken: the hotel was so conspicuous in that God-forsaken place
that he could not fail to see it even in the dark."
"It was a long,
blackened wooden building, and in spite of the late hour there were
lights in the windows and signs of life within."
"He went in and asked
a ragged fellow who met him in the corridor for a room."
"The latter,
scanning Svidrigaïlov, pulled himself together and led him at once to a
close and tiny room in the distance, at the end of the corridor, under
the stairs."
"There was no other, all were occupied."
"The ragged fellow
looked inquiringly."
“Is there tea?” asked Svidrigaïlov.
"“Yes, sir.”

“What else is there?”

“Veal, vodka, savouries.”

“Bring me tea and veal.”

“And you want nothing else?” he asked with apparent surprise."
"“Nothing, nothing.”

The ragged man went away, completely disillusioned."
"“It must be a nice place,” thought Svidrigaïlov."
"“How was it I didn’t
know it?"
"I expect I look as if I came from a café chantant and have
had some adventure on the way."
"It would be interesting to know who stayed
here?”

He lighted the candle and looked at the room more carefully."
"It was a
room so low-pitched that Svidrigaïlov could only just stand up in it;
it had one window; the bed, which was very dirty, and the plain-stained
chair and table almost filled it up."
"The walls looked as though they
were made of planks, covered with shabby paper, so torn and dusty
that the pattern was indistinguishable, though the general
colour--yellow--could still be made out."
"One of the walls was cut short
by the sloping ceiling, though the room was not an attic but just under
the stairs."
"Svidrigaïlov set down the candle, sat down on the bed and sank into
thought."
"But a strange persistent murmur which sometimes rose to a shout
in the next room attracted his attention."
"The murmur had not ceased from
the moment he entered the room."
"He listened: someone was upbraiding and
almost tearfully scolding, but he heard only one voice."
"Svidrigaïlov got up, shaded the light with his hand and at once he saw
light through a crack in the wall; he went up and peeped through."
"The
room, which was somewhat larger than his, had two occupants."
"One of
them, a very curly-headed man with a red inflamed face, was standing
in the pose of an orator, without his coat, with his legs wide apart to
preserve his balance, and smiting himself on the breast."
"He reproached
the other with being a beggar, with having no standing whatever."
"He
declared that he had taken the other out of the gutter and he could turn
him out when he liked, and that only the finger of Providence sees it
all."
"The object of his reproaches was sitting in a chair, and had the
air of a man who wants dreadfully to sneeze, but can’t."
"He sometimes
turned sheepish and befogged eyes on the speaker, but obviously had not
the slightest idea what he was talking about and scarcely heard it."
"A
candle was burning down on the table; there were wine-glasses, a nearly
empty bottle of vodka, bread and cucumber, and glasses with the dregs
of stale tea."
"After gazing attentively at this, Svidrigaïlov turned away
indifferently and sat down on the bed."
"The ragged attendant, returning with the tea, could not resist asking
him again whether he didn’t want anything more, and again receiving a
negative reply, finally withdrew."
"Svidrigaïlov made haste to drink a
glass of tea to warm himself, but could not eat anything."
"He began
to feel feverish."
"He took off his coat and, wrapping himself in the
blanket, lay down on the bed."
He was annoyed.
"“It would have been better
to be well for the occasion,” he thought with a smile."
"The room was
close, the candle burnt dimly, the wind was roaring outside, he heard
a mouse scratching in the corner and the room smelt of mice and of
leather."
He lay in a sort of reverie: one thought followed another.
"He
felt a longing to fix his imagination on something."
"“It must be a garden
under the window,” he thought."
“There’s a sound of trees.
"How I dislike
the sound of trees on a stormy night, in the dark!"
"They give one a
horrid feeling.” He remembered how he had disliked it when he passed
Petrovsky Park just now."
"This reminded him of the bridge over the Little
Neva and he felt cold again as he had when standing there."
"“I never have
liked water,” he thought, “even in a landscape,” and he suddenly smiled
again at a strange idea: “Surely now all these questions of taste and
comfort ought not to matter, but I’ve become more particular, like an
animal that picks out a special place... for such an occasion."
"I ought
to have gone into the Petrovsky Park!"
"I suppose it seemed dark, cold,
ha-ha!"
As though I were seeking pleasant sensations!...
"By the way, why
haven’t I put out the candle?” he blew it out."
"“They’ve gone to bed next
door,” he thought, not seeing the light at the crack."
"“Well, now, Marfa
Petrovna, now is the time for you to turn up; it’s dark, and the very
time and place for you."
"But now you won’t come!”

He suddenly recalled how, an hour before carrying out his design on
Dounia, he had recommended Raskolnikov to trust her to Razumihin’s
keeping."
"“I suppose I really did say it, as Raskolnikov guessed, to
tease myself."
But what a rogue that Raskolnikov is!
"He’s gone through a
good deal."
"He may be a successful rogue in time when he’s got over
his nonsense."
But now he’s _too_ eager for life.
"These young men
are contemptible on that point."
"But, hang the fellow!"
"Let him please
himself, it’s nothing to do with me.”

He could not get to sleep."
"By degrees Dounia’s image rose before him,
and a shudder ran over him."
"“No, I must give up all that now,” he
thought, rousing himself."
“I must think of something else.
"It’s queer
and funny."
"I never had a great hatred for anyone, I never particularly
desired to avenge myself even, and that’s a bad sign, a bad sign, a bad
sign."
"I never liked quarrelling either, and never lost my temper--that’s
a bad sign too."
"And the promises I made her just now, too--Damnation!"
"But--who knows?--perhaps she would have made a new man of me
somehow....”

He ground his teeth and sank into silence again."
"Again Dounia’s image
rose before him, just as she was when, after shooting the first time,
she had lowered the revolver in terror and gazed blankly at him, so that
he might have seized her twice over and she would not have lifted a hand
to defend herself if he had not reminded her."
"He recalled how at that
instant he felt almost sorry for her, how he had felt a pang at his
heart...

“Aïe!"
"Damnation, these thoughts again!"
"I must put it away!”

He was dozing off; the feverish shiver had ceased, when suddenly
something seemed to run over his arm and leg under the bedclothes."
"He
started."
“Ugh!
hang it!
"I believe it’s a mouse,” he thought, “that’s the
veal I left on the table.” He felt fearfully disinclined to pull off the
blanket, get up, get cold, but all at once something unpleasant ran over
his leg again."
He pulled off the blanket and lighted the candle.
"Shaking
with feverish chill he bent down to examine the bed: there was nothing."
He shook the blanket and suddenly a mouse jumped out on the sheet.
"He tried to catch it, but the mouse ran to and fro in zigzags without
leaving the bed, slipped between his fingers, ran over his hand and
suddenly darted under the pillow."
"He threw down the pillow, but in one
instant felt something leap on his chest and dart over his body and down
his back under his shirt."
He trembled nervously and woke up.
The room was dark.
"He was lying on the bed and wrapped up in the blanket
as before."
The wind was howling under the window.
"“How disgusting,” he
thought with annoyance."
"He got up and sat on the edge of the bedstead with his back to the
window."
"“It’s better not to sleep at all,” he decided."
"There was a cold
damp draught from the window, however; without getting up he drew the
blanket over him and wrapped himself in it."
"He was not thinking of
anything and did not want to think."
"But one image rose after another,
incoherent scraps of thought without beginning or end passed through his
mind."
He sank into drowsiness.
"Perhaps the cold, or the dampness, or
the dark, or the wind that howled under the window and tossed the trees
roused a sort of persistent craving for the fantastic."
"He kept dwelling
on images of flowers, he fancied a charming flower garden, a bright,
warm, almost hot day, a holiday--Trinity day."
"A fine, sumptuous country
cottage in the English taste overgrown with fragrant flowers, with
flower beds going round the house; the porch, wreathed in climbers, was
surrounded with beds of roses."
"A light, cool staircase, carpeted with
rich rugs, was decorated with rare plants in china pots."
"He noticed
particularly in the windows nosegays of tender, white, heavily fragrant
narcissus bending over their bright, green, thick long stalks."
"He was
reluctant to move away from them, but he went up the stairs and came
into a large, high drawing-room and again everywhere--at the windows,
the doors on to the balcony, and on the balcony itself--were flowers."
"The floors were strewn with freshly-cut fragrant hay, the windows
were open, a fresh, cool, light air came into the room."
"The birds were
chirruping under the window, and in the middle of the room, on a table
covered with a white satin shroud, stood a coffin."
"The coffin was
covered with white silk and edged with a thick white frill; wreaths of
flowers surrounded it on all sides."
"Among the flowers lay a girl in a
white muslin dress, with her arms crossed and pressed on her bosom, as
though carved out of marble."
"But her loose fair hair was wet; there was
a wreath of roses on her head."
"The stern and already rigid profile of
her face looked as though chiselled of marble too, and the smile on her
pale lips was full of an immense unchildish misery and sorrowful appeal."
"Svidrigaïlov knew that girl; there was no holy image, no burning candle
beside the coffin; no sound of prayers: the girl had drowned herself."
"She was only fourteen, but her heart was broken."
"And she had destroyed
herself, crushed by an insult that had appalled and amazed that childish
soul, had smirched that angel purity with unmerited disgrace and torn
from her a last scream of despair, unheeded and brutally disregarded, on
a dark night in the cold and wet while the wind howled....

Svidrigaïlov came to himself, got up from the bed and went to the
window."
He felt for the latch and opened it.
"The wind lashed furiously
into the little room and stung his face and his chest, only covered with
his shirt, as though with frost."
"Under the window there must have been
something like a garden, and apparently a pleasure garden."
"There, too,
probably there were tea-tables and singing in the daytime."
"Now drops of
rain flew in at the window from the trees and bushes; it was dark as
in a cellar, so that he could only just make out some dark blurs of
objects."
"Svidrigaïlov, bending down with elbows on the window-sill,
gazed for five minutes into the darkness; the boom of a cannon, followed
by a second one, resounded in the darkness of the night."
"“Ah, the
signal!"
"The river is overflowing,” he thought."
"“By morning it will be
swirling down the street in the lower parts, flooding the basements and
cellars."
"The cellar rats will swim out, and men will curse in the rain
and wind as they drag their rubbish to their upper storeys."
"What time is
it now?” And he had hardly thought it when, somewhere near, a clock on
the wall, ticking away hurriedly, struck three."
“Aha!
It will be light in an hour!
Why wait?
"I’ll go out at once
straight to the park."
"I’ll choose a great bush there drenched with rain,
so that as soon as one’s shoulder touches it, millions of drops drip on
one’s head.”

He moved away from the window, shut it, lighted the candle, put on his
waistcoat, his overcoat and his hat and went out, carrying the candle,
into the passage to look for the ragged attendant who would be asleep
somewhere in the midst of candle-ends and all sorts of rubbish, to pay
him for the room and leave the hotel."
"“It’s the best minute; I couldn’t
choose a better.”

He walked for some time through a long narrow corridor without finding
anyone and was just going to call out, when suddenly in a dark corner
between an old cupboard and the door he caught sight of a strange object
which seemed to be alive."
"He bent down with the candle and saw a little
girl, not more than five years old, shivering and crying, with her
clothes as wet as a soaking house-flannel."
"She did not seem afraid of
Svidrigaïlov, but looked at him with blank amazement out of her big
black eyes."
"Now and then she sobbed as children do when they have been
crying a long time, but are beginning to be comforted."
"The child’s face
was pale and tired, she was numb with cold."
“How can she have come here?
"She must have hidden here and not slept all night.” He began questioning
her."
"The child suddenly becoming animated, chattered away in her baby
language, something about “mammy” and that “mammy would beat her,” and
about some cup that she had “bwoken.” The child chattered on without
stopping."
"He could only guess from what she said that she was a
neglected child, whose mother, probably a drunken cook, in the service
of the hotel, whipped and frightened her; that the child had broken
a cup of her mother’s and was so frightened that she had run away the
evening before, had hidden for a long while somewhere outside in the
rain, at last had made her way in here, hidden behind the cupboard and
spent the night there, crying and trembling from the damp, the darkness
and the fear that she would be badly beaten for it."
"He took her in his
arms, went back to his room, sat her on the bed, and began undressing
her."
"The torn shoes which she had on her stockingless feet were as
wet as if they had been standing in a puddle all night."
"When he had
undressed her, he put her on the bed, covered her up and wrapped her in
the blanket from her head downwards."
She fell asleep at once.
"Then he
sank into dreary musing again."
"“What folly to trouble myself,” he decided suddenly with an oppressive
feeling of annoyance."
"“What idiocy!” In vexation he took up the candle
to go and look for the ragged attendant again and make haste to go away."
"“Damn the child!” he thought as he opened the door, but he turned again
to see whether the child was asleep."
He raised the blanket carefully.
"The child was sleeping soundly, she had got warm under the blanket,
and her pale cheeks were flushed."
"But strange to say that flush seemed
brighter and coarser than the rosy cheeks of childhood."
"“It’s a flush
of fever,” thought Svidrigaïlov."
"It was like the flush from drinking, as
though she had been given a full glass to drink."
"Her crimson lips were
hot and glowing; but what was this?"
"He suddenly fancied that her long
black eyelashes were quivering, as though the lids were opening and a
sly crafty eye peeped out with an unchildlike wink, as though the little
girl were not asleep, but pretending."
"Yes, it was so."
"Her lips parted in
a smile."
"The corners of her mouth quivered, as though she were trying to
control them."
"But now she quite gave up all effort, now it was a grin,
a broad grin; there was something shameless, provocative in that quite
unchildish face; it was depravity, it was the face of a harlot, the
shameless face of a French harlot."
"Now both eyes opened wide; they
turned a glowing, shameless glance upon him; they laughed, invited
him...."
"There was something infinitely hideous and shocking in that
laugh, in those eyes, in such nastiness in the face of a child."
"“What,
at five years old?” Svidrigaïlov muttered in genuine horror."
"“What does
it mean?” And now she turned to him, her little face all aglow, holding
out her arms.... “Accursed child!” Svidrigaïlov cried, raising his hand
to strike her, but at that moment he woke up."
"He was in the same bed, still wrapped in the blanket."
"The candle had not
been lighted, and daylight was streaming in at the windows."
"“I’ve had nightmare all night!” He got up angrily, feeling utterly
shattered; his bones ached."
"There was a thick mist outside and he could
see nothing."
It was nearly five.
He had overslept himself!
"He got up,
put on his still damp jacket and overcoat."
"Feeling the revolver in his
pocket, he took it out and then he sat down, took a notebook out of his
pocket and in the most conspicuous place on the title page wrote a few
lines in large letters."
"Reading them over, he sank into thought with his
elbows on the table."
The revolver and the notebook lay beside him.
"Some
flies woke up and settled on the untouched veal, which was still on
the table."
"He stared at them and at last with his free right hand began
trying to catch one."
"He tried till he was tired, but could not catch it."
"At last, realising that he was engaged in this interesting pursuit, he
started, got up and walked resolutely out of the room."
"A minute later he
was in the street."
A thick milky mist hung over the town.
"Svidrigaïlov walked along the
slippery dirty wooden pavement towards the Little Neva."
"He was picturing
the waters of the Little Neva swollen in the night, Petrovsky Island,
the wet paths, the wet grass, the wet trees and bushes and at last the
bush...."
"He began ill-humouredly staring at the houses, trying to think
of something else."
There was not a cabman or a passer-by in the street.
"The bright yellow, wooden, little houses looked dirty and dejected with
their closed shutters."
"The cold and damp penetrated his whole body and
he began to shiver."
"From time to time he came across shop signs and read
each carefully."
"At last he reached the end of the wooden pavement and
came to a big stone house."
"A dirty, shivering dog crossed his path with
its tail between its legs."
"A man in a greatcoat lay face downwards; dead
drunk, across the pavement."
He looked at him and went on.
"A high tower
stood up on the left."
"“Bah!” he shouted, “here is a place."
"Why should
it be Petrovsky?"
"It will be in the presence of an official witness
anyway....”

He almost smiled at this new thought and turned into the street where
there was the big house with the tower."
"At the great closed gates of
the house, a little man stood with his shoulder leaning against them,
wrapped in a grey soldier’s coat, with a copper Achilles helmet on his
head."
He cast a drowsy and indifferent glance at Svidrigaïlov.
"His
face wore that perpetual look of peevish dejection, which is so sourly
printed on all faces of Jewish race without exception."
"They both,
Svidrigaïlov and Achilles, stared at each other for a few minutes
without speaking."
"At last it struck Achilles as irregular for a man
not drunk to be standing three steps from him, staring and not saying a
word."
"“What do you want here?” he said, without moving or changing his
position."
"“Nothing, brother, good morning,” answered Svidrigaïlov."
"“This isn’t the place.”

“I am going to foreign parts, brother.”

“To foreign parts?”

“To America.”

“America.”

Svidrigaïlov took out the revolver and cocked it."
"Achilles raised his
eyebrows."
"“I say, this is not the place for such jokes!”

“Why shouldn’t it be the place?”

“Because it isn’t.”

“Well, brother, I don’t mind that."
It’s a good place.
"When you are
asked, you just say he was going, he said, to America.”

He put the revolver to his right temple."
"“You can’t do it here, it’s not the place,” cried Achilles, rousing
himself, his eyes growing bigger and bigger."
Svidrigaïlov pulled the trigger.
"CHAPTER VII

The same day, about seven o’clock in the evening, Raskolnikov was on
his way to his mother’s and sister’s lodging--the lodging in Bakaleyev’s
house which Razumihin had found for them."
"The stairs went up from
the street."
"Raskolnikov walked with lagging steps, as though still
hesitating whether to go or not."
"But nothing would have turned him back:
his decision was taken."
"“Besides, it doesn’t matter, they still know nothing,” he thought, “and
they are used to thinking of me as eccentric.”

He was appallingly dressed: his clothes torn and dirty, soaked with a
night’s rain."
"His face was almost distorted from fatigue, exposure, the
inward conflict that had lasted for twenty-four hours."
"He had spent all
the previous night alone, God knows where."
"But anyway he had reached a
decision."
He knocked at the door which was opened by his mother.
"Dounia was not
at home."
Even the servant happened to be out.
"At first Pulcheria
Alexandrovna was speechless with joy and surprise; then she took him by
the hand and drew him into the room."
"“Here you are!” she began, faltering with joy."
"“Don’t be angry with
me, Rodya, for welcoming you so foolishly with tears: I am laughing not
crying."
Did you think I was crying?
"No, I am delighted, but I’ve got
into such a stupid habit of shedding tears."
"I’ve been like that ever
since your father’s death."
I cry for anything.
"Sit down, dear boy, you
must be tired; I see you are."
"Ah, how muddy you are.”

“I was in the rain yesterday, mother....” Raskolnikov began."
"“No, no,” Pulcheria Alexandrovna hurriedly interrupted, “you thought I
was going to cross-question you in the womanish way I used to; don’t be
anxious, I understand, I understand it all: now I’ve learned the ways
here and truly I see for myself that they are better."
"I’ve made up my
mind once for all: how could I understand your plans and expect you to
give an account of them?"
"God knows what concerns and plans you may have,
or what ideas you are hatching; so it’s not for me to keep nudging your
elbow, asking you what you are thinking about?"
"But, my goodness!"
"why
am I running to and fro as though I were crazy...?"
"I am reading your
article in the magazine for the third time, Rodya."
"Dmitri Prokofitch
brought it to me."
"Directly I saw it I cried out to myself: ‘There,
foolish one,’ I thought, ‘that’s what he is busy about; that’s the
solution of the mystery!"
Learned people are always like that.
"He may
have some new ideas in his head just now; he is thinking them over and I
worry him and upset him.’ I read it, my dear, and of course there was a
great deal I did not understand; but that’s only natural--how should I?”

“Show me, mother.”

Raskolnikov took the magazine and glanced at his article."
"Incongruous
as it was with his mood and his circumstances, he felt that strange and
bitter sweet sensation that every author experiences the first time he
sees himself in print; besides, he was only twenty-three."
"It lasted only
a moment."
"After reading a few lines he frowned and his heart throbbed
with anguish."
"He recalled all the inward conflict of the preceding
months."
He flung the article on the table with disgust and anger.
"“But, however foolish I may be, Rodya, I can see for myself that you
will very soon be one of the leading--if not the leading man--in the
world of Russian thought."
And they dared to think you were mad!
"You
don’t know, but they really thought that."
"Ah, the despicable creatures,
how could they understand genius!"
"And Dounia, Dounia was all but
believing it--what do you say to that?"
"Your father sent twice to
magazines--the first time poems (I’ve got the manuscript and will show
you) and the second time a whole novel (I begged him to let me copy it
out) and how we prayed that they should be taken--they weren’t!"
"I was
breaking my heart, Rodya, six or seven days ago over your food and your
clothes and the way you are living."
"But now I see again how foolish
I was, for you can attain any position you like by your intellect and
talent."
"No doubt you don’t care about that for the present and you are
occupied with much more important matters....”

“Dounia’s not at home, mother?”

“No, Rodya."
I often don’t see her; she leaves me alone.
"Dmitri
Prokofitch comes to see me, it’s so good of him, and he always talks
about you."
"He loves you and respects you, my dear."
"I don’t say that
Dounia is very wanting in consideration."
I am not complaining.
"She has
her ways and I have mine; she seems to have got some secrets of late and
I never have any secrets from you two."
"Of course, I am sure that Dounia
has far too much sense, and besides she loves you and me... but I don’t
know what it will all lead to."
"You’ve made me so happy by coming now,
Rodya, but she has missed you by going out; when she comes in I’ll tell
her: ‘Your brother came in while you were out."
"Where have you been all
this time?’ You mustn’t spoil me, Rodya, you know; come when you can,
but if you can’t, it doesn’t matter, I can wait."
"I shall know, anyway,
that you are fond of me, that will be enough for me."
"I shall read what
you write, I shall hear about you from everyone, and sometimes you’ll
come yourself to see me."
What could be better?
"Here you’ve come now to
comfort your mother, I see that.”

Here Pulcheria Alexandrovna began to cry."
“Here I am again!
Don’t mind my foolishness.
"My goodness, why am I
sitting here?” she cried, jumping up."
"“There is coffee and I don’t offer
you any."
"Ah, that’s the selfishness of old age."
"I’ll get it at once!”

“Mother, don’t trouble, I am going at once."
I haven’t come for that.
"Please listen to me.”

Pulcheria Alexandrovna went up to him timidly."
"“Mother, whatever happens, whatever you hear about me, whatever you are
told about me, will you always love me as you do now?” he asked suddenly
from the fullness of his heart, as though not thinking of his words and
not weighing them."
"“Rodya, Rodya, what is the matter?"
How can you ask me such a question?
"Why, who will tell me anything about you?"
"Besides, I shouldn’t believe
anyone, I should refuse to listen.”

“I’ve come to assure you that I’ve always loved you and I am glad
that we are alone, even glad Dounia is out,” he went on with the same
impulse."
"“I have come to tell you that though you will be unhappy, you
must believe that your son loves you now more than himself, and that all
you thought about me, that I was cruel and didn’t care about you, was
all a mistake."
"I shall never cease to love you.... Well, that’s enough:
I thought I must do this and begin with this....”

Pulcheria Alexandrovna embraced him in silence, pressing him to her
bosom and weeping gently."
"“I don’t know what is wrong with you, Rodya,” she said at last."
"“I’ve
been thinking all this time that we were simply boring you and now I see
that there is a great sorrow in store for you, and that’s why you are
miserable."
"I’ve foreseen it a long time, Rodya."
"Forgive me for speaking
about it."
I keep thinking about it and lie awake at nights.
"Your sister
lay talking in her sleep all last night, talking of nothing but you."
"I
caught something, but I couldn’t make it out."
"I felt all the morning
as though I were going to be hanged, waiting for something, expecting
something, and now it has come!"
"Rodya, Rodya, where are you going?"
"You
are going away somewhere?”

“Yes.”

“That’s what I thought!"
"I can come with you, you know, if you need
me."
"And Dounia, too; she loves you, she loves you dearly--and Sofya
Semyonovna may come with us if you like."
"You see, I am glad to look upon
her as a daughter even... Dmitri Prokofitch will help us to go together."
"But... where... are you going?”

“Good-bye, mother.”

“What, to-day?” she cried, as though losing him for ever."
"“I can’t stay, I must go now....”

“And can’t I come with you?”

“No, but kneel down and pray to God for me."
"Your prayer perhaps will
reach Him.”

“Let me bless you and sign you with the cross."
"That’s right, that’s
right."
"Oh, God, what are we doing?”

Yes, he was glad, he was very glad that there was no one there, that
he was alone with his mother."
"For the first time after all those awful
months his heart was softened."
"He fell down before her, he kissed her
feet and both wept, embracing."
"And she was not surprised and did not
question him this time."
"For some days she had realised that something
awful was happening to her son and that now some terrible minute had
come for him."
"“Rodya, my darling, my first born,” she said sobbing, “now you are just
as when you were little."
"You would run like this to me and hug me and
kiss me."
"When your father was living and we were poor, you comforted us
simply by being with us and when I buried your father, how often we
wept together at his grave and embraced, as now."
"And if I’ve been crying
lately, it’s that my mother’s heart had a foreboding of trouble."
"The
first time I saw you, that evening, you remember, as soon as we arrived
here, I guessed simply from your eyes."
"My heart sank at once, and to-day
when I opened the door and looked at you, I thought the fatal hour had
come."
"Rodya, Rodya, you are not going away to-day?”

“No!”

“You’ll come again?”

“Yes... I’ll come.”

“Rodya, don’t be angry, I don’t dare to question you."
I know I mustn’t.
"Only say two words to me--is it far where you are going?”

“Very far.”

“What is awaiting you there?"
"Some post or career for you?”

“What God sends... only pray for me.” Raskolnikov went to the door, but
she clutched him and gazed despairingly into his eyes."
"Her face worked
with terror."
"“Enough, mother,” said Raskolnikov, deeply regretting that he had come."
"“Not for ever, it’s not yet for ever?"
"You’ll come, you’ll come
to-morrow?”

“I will, I will, good-bye.” He tore himself away at last."
"It was a warm, fresh, bright evening; it had cleared up in the morning."
Raskolnikov went to his lodgings; he made haste.
"He wanted to finish all
before sunset."
He did not want to meet anyone till then.
"Going up the
stairs he noticed that Nastasya rushed from the samovar to watch him
intently."
“Can anyone have come to see me?” he wondered.
"He had a
disgusted vision of Porfiry."
But opening his door he saw Dounia.
"She
was sitting alone, plunged in deep thought, and looked as though she had
been waiting a long time."
He stopped short in the doorway.
"She rose from
the sofa in dismay and stood up facing him."
"Her eyes, fixed upon him,
betrayed horror and infinite grief."
"And from those eyes alone he saw at
once that she knew."
“Am I to come in or go away?” he asked uncertainly.
“I’ve been all day with Sofya Semyonovna.
We were both waiting for you.
"We thought that you would be sure to come there.”

Raskolnikov went into the room and sank exhausted on a chair."
"“I feel weak, Dounia, I am very tired; and I should have liked at this
moment to be able to control myself.”

He glanced at her mistrustfully."
"“Where were you all night?”

“I don’t remember clearly."
"You see, sister, I wanted to make up my mind
once for all, and several times I walked by the Neva, I remember that
I wanted to end it all there, but..."
"I couldn’t make up my mind,” he
whispered, looking at her mistrustfully again."
“Thank God!
"That was just what we were afraid of, Sofya Semyonovna and
I."
Then you still have faith in life?
"Thank God, thank God!”

Raskolnikov smiled bitterly."
"“I haven’t faith, but I have just been weeping in mother’s arms; I
haven’t faith, but I have just asked her to pray for me."
"I don’t know
how it is, Dounia, I don’t understand it.”

“Have you been at mother’s?"
"Have you told her?” cried Dounia,
horror-stricken."
"“Surely you haven’t done that?”

“No, I didn’t tell her... in words; but she understood a great deal."
She heard you talking in your sleep.
"I am sure she half understands it
already."
Perhaps I did wrong in going to see her.
"I don’t know why I did
go."
"I am a contemptible person, Dounia.”

“A contemptible person, but ready to face suffering!"
"You are, aren’t
you?”

“Yes, I am going."
At once.
"Yes, to escape the disgrace I thought of
drowning myself, Dounia, but as I looked into the water, I thought that
if I had considered myself strong till now I’d better not be afraid of
disgrace,” he said, hurrying on."
"“It’s pride, Dounia.”

“Pride, Rodya.”

There was a gleam of fire in his lustreless eyes; he seemed to be glad
to think that he was still proud."
"“You don’t think, sister, that I was simply afraid of the water?” he
asked, looking into her face with a sinister smile."
"“Oh, Rodya, hush!” cried Dounia bitterly."
"Silence lasted for two
minutes."
"He sat with his eyes fixed on the floor; Dounia stood at the
other end of the table and looked at him with anguish."
"Suddenly he got
up."
"“It’s late, it’s time to go!"
I am going at once to give myself up.
"But I
don’t know why I am going to give myself up.”

Big tears fell down her cheeks."
"“You are crying, sister, but can you hold out your hand to me?”

“You doubted it?”

She threw her arms round him."
"“Aren’t you half expiating your crime by facing the suffering?” she
cried, holding him close and kissing him."
“Crime?
What crime?” he cried in sudden fury.
"“That I killed a vile
noxious insect, an old pawnbroker woman, of use to no one!..."
"Killing
her was atonement for forty sins."
"She was sucking the life out of poor
people."
Was that a crime?
"I am not thinking of it and I am not thinking
of expiating it, and why are you all rubbing it in on all sides?"
"‘A
crime!"
"a crime!’ Only now I see clearly the imbecility of my cowardice,
now that I have decided to face this superfluous disgrace."
"It’s simply
because I am contemptible and have nothing in me that I have decided to,
perhaps too for my advantage, as that... Porfiry... suggested!”

“Brother, brother, what are you saying?"
"Why, you have shed blood?” cried
Dounia in despair."
"“Which all men shed,” he put in almost frantically, “which flows and has
always flowed in streams, which is spilt like champagne, and for which
men are crowned in the Capitol and are called afterwards benefactors of
mankind."
Look into it more carefully and understand it!
"I too wanted to
do good to men and would have done hundreds, thousands of good deeds
to make up for that one piece of stupidity, not stupidity even, simply
clumsiness, for the idea was by no means so stupid as it seems now
that it has failed.... (Everything seems stupid when it fails.)"
"By that
stupidity I only wanted to put myself into an independent position, to
take the first step, to obtain means, and then everything would have
been smoothed over by benefits immeasurable in comparison...."
But I...
"I couldn’t carry out even the first step, because I am contemptible,
that’s what’s the matter!"
And yet I won’t look at it as you do.
"If I had
succeeded I should have been crowned with glory, but now I’m trapped.”

“But that’s not so, not so!"
"Brother, what are you saying?”

“Ah, it’s not picturesque, not æsthetically attractive!"
"I fail to
understand why bombarding people by regular siege is more honourable."
The fear of appearances is the first symptom of impotence.
"I’ve never,
never recognised this more clearly than now, and I am further than ever
from seeing that what I did was a crime."
"I’ve never, never been stronger
and more convinced than now.”

The colour had rushed into his pale exhausted face, but as he uttered
his last explanation, he happened to meet Dounia’s eyes and he saw such
anguish in them that he could not help being checked."
"He felt that he
had, anyway, made these two poor women miserable, that he was, anyway,
the cause...

“Dounia darling, if I am guilty forgive me (though I cannot be forgiven
if I am guilty)."
Good-bye!
We won’t dispute.
"It’s time, high time to go."
"Don’t follow me, I beseech you, I have somewhere else to go...."
"But you
go at once and sit with mother."
I entreat you to!
"It’s my last request
of you."
"Don’t leave her at all; I left her in a state of anxiety, that
she is not fit to bear; she will die or go out of her mind."
"Be with
her!"
Razumihin will be with you.
"I’ve been talking to him.... Don’t cry
about me: I’ll try to be honest and manly all my life, even if I am a
murderer."
Perhaps I shall some day make a name.
"I won’t disgrace you,
you will see; I’ll still show.... Now good-bye for the present,” he
concluded hurriedly, noticing again a strange expression in Dounia’s
eyes at his last words and promises."
“Why are you crying?
"Don’t cry,
don’t cry: we are not parting for ever!"
"Ah, yes!"
"Wait a minute, I’d
forgotten!”

He went to the table, took up a thick dusty book, opened it and took
from between the pages a little water-colour portrait on ivory."
"It was
the portrait of his landlady’s daughter, who had died of fever, that
strange girl who had wanted to be a nun."
"For a minute he gazed at the
delicate expressive face of his betrothed, kissed the portrait and gave
it to Dounia."
"“I used to talk a great deal about it to her, only to her,” he said
thoughtfully."
"“To her heart I confided much of what has since been so
hideously realised."
"Don’t be uneasy,” he returned to Dounia, “she was
as much opposed to it as you, and I am glad that she is gone."
"The great
point is that everything now is going to be different, is going to
be broken in two,” he cried, suddenly returning to his dejection."
"“Everything, everything, and am I prepared for it?"
Do I want it myself?
They say it is necessary for me to suffer!
"What’s the object of these
senseless sufferings?"
"shall I know any better what they are for, when I
am crushed by hardships and idiocy, and weak as an old man after twenty
years’ penal servitude?"
And what shall I have to live for then?
"Why am I
consenting to that life now?"
"Oh, I knew I was contemptible when I stood
looking at the Neva at daybreak to-day!”

At last they both went out."
"It was hard for Dounia, but she loved him."
"She walked away, but after going fifty paces she turned round to look
at him again."
He was still in sight.
"At the corner he too turned and for
the last time their eyes met; but noticing that she was looking at him,
he motioned her away with impatience and even vexation, and turned the
corner abruptly."
"“I am wicked, I see that,” he thought to himself, feeling ashamed a
moment later of his angry gesture to Dounia."
"“But why are they so fond
of me if I don’t deserve it?"
"Oh, if only I were alone and no one loved
me and I too had never loved anyone!"
"_Nothing of all this would have
happened._ But I wonder shall I in those fifteen or twenty years grow so
meek that I shall humble myself before people and whimper at every word
that I am a criminal?"
"Yes, that’s it, that’s it, that’s what they are
sending me there for, that’s what they want."
"Look at them running to and
fro about the streets, every one of them a scoundrel and a criminal at
heart and, worse still, an idiot."
"But try to get me off and they’d be
wild with righteous indignation."
"Oh, how I hate them all!”

He fell to musing by what process it could come to pass, that he could
be humbled before all of them, indiscriminately--humbled by conviction."
And yet why not?
It must be so.
"Would not twenty years of continual
bondage crush him utterly?"
Water wears out a stone.
"And why, why should
he live after that?"
"Why should he go now when he knew that it would be
so?"
"It was the hundredth time perhaps that he had asked himself that
question since the previous evening, but still he went."
"CHAPTER VIII

When he went into Sonia’s room, it was already getting dark."
"All day
Sonia had been waiting for him in terrible anxiety."
"Dounia had been
waiting with her."
"She had come to her that morning, remembering
Svidrigaïlov’s words that Sonia knew."
"We will not describe the
conversation and tears of the two girls, and how friendly they became."
"Dounia gained one comfort at least from that interview, that her
brother would not be alone."
"He had gone to her, Sonia, first with his
confession; he had gone to her for human fellowship when he needed it;
she would go with him wherever fate might send him."
"Dounia did not ask,
but she knew it was so."
"She looked at Sonia almost with reverence and
at first almost embarrassed her by it."
"Sonia was almost on the point
of tears."
"She felt herself, on the contrary, hardly worthy to look at
Dounia."
"Dounia’s gracious image when she had bowed to her so attentively
and respectfully at their first meeting in Raskolnikov’s room had
remained in her mind as one of the fairest visions of her life."
"Dounia at last became impatient and, leaving Sonia, went to her
brother’s room to await him there; she kept thinking that he would come
there first."
"When she had gone, Sonia began to be tortured by the dread
of his committing suicide, and Dounia too feared it."
"But they had spent
the day trying to persuade each other that that could not be, and both
were less anxious while they were together."
"As soon as they parted, each
thought of nothing else."
"Sonia remembered how Svidrigaïlov had said to
her the day before that Raskolnikov had two alternatives--Siberia or..."
"Besides she knew his vanity, his pride and his lack of faith."
"“Is it possible that he has nothing but cowardice and fear of death to
make him live?” she thought at last in despair."
Meanwhile the sun was setting.
"Sonia was standing in dejection, looking
intently out of the window, but from it she could see nothing but the
unwhitewashed blank wall of the next house."
"At last when she began to
feel sure of his death--he walked into the room."
"She gave a cry of joy, but looking carefully into his face she turned
pale."
"“Yes,” said Raskolnikov, smiling."
"“I have come for your cross, Sonia."
"It
was you told me to go to the cross-roads; why is it you are frightened
now it’s come to that?”

Sonia gazed at him astonished."
"His tone seemed strange to her; a cold
shiver ran over her, but in a moment she guessed that the tone and the
words were a mask."
"He spoke to her looking away, as though to avoid
meeting her eyes."
"“You see, Sonia, I’ve decided that it will be better so."
"There is one
fact...."
But it’s a long story and there’s no need to discuss it.
"But
do you know what angers me?"
"It annoys me that all those stupid brutish
faces will be gaping at me directly, pestering me with their stupid
questions, which I shall have to answer--they’ll point their fingers at
me.... Tfoo!"
"You know I am not going to Porfiry, I am sick of him."
"I’d
rather go to my friend, the Explosive Lieutenant; how I shall surprise
him, what a sensation I shall make!"
"But I must be cooler; I’ve become
too irritable of late."
"You know I was nearly shaking my fist at my
sister just now, because she turned to take a last look at me."
"It’s
a brutal state to be in!"
Ah!
what am I coming to!
"Well, where are the
crosses?”

He seemed hardly to know what he was doing."
"He could not stay still or
concentrate his attention on anything; his ideas seemed to gallop after
one another, he talked incoherently, his hands trembled slightly."
"Without a word Sonia took out of the drawer two crosses, one of cypress
wood and one of copper."
"She made the sign of the cross over herself and
over him, and put the wooden cross on his neck."
"“It’s the symbol of my taking up the cross,” he laughed."
"“As though I
had not suffered much till now!"
"The wooden cross, that is the peasant
one; the copper one, that is Lizaveta’s--you will wear yourself, show
me!"
So she had it on... at that moment?
"I remember two things like
these too, a silver one and a little ikon."
"I threw them back on the old
woman’s neck."
"Those would be appropriate now, really, those are what I
ought to put on now...."
"But I am talking nonsense and forgetting what
matters; I’m somehow forgetful.... You see I have come to warn you,
Sonia, so that you might know... that’s all--that’s all I came for."
"But
I thought I had more to say."
You wanted me to go yourself.
"Well, now I
am going to prison and you’ll have your wish."
"Well, what are you crying
for?"
You too?
Don’t.
Leave off!
"Oh, how I hate it all!”

But his feeling was stirred; his heart ached, as he looked at her."
"“Why
is she grieving too?” he thought to himself."
“What am I to her?
"Why does
she weep?"
"Why is she looking after me, like my mother or Dounia?"
"She’ll
be my nurse.”

“Cross yourself, say at least one prayer,” Sonia begged in a timid
broken voice."
"“Oh certainly, as much as you like!"
"And sincerely, Sonia, sincerely....”

But he wanted to say something quite different."
He crossed himself several times.
"Sonia took up her shawl and put
it over her head."
"It was the green _drap de dames_ shawl of which
Marmeladov had spoken, “the family shawl.” Raskolnikov thought of that
looking at it, but he did not ask."
"He began to feel himself that he
was certainly forgetting things and was disgustingly agitated."
"He was
frightened at this."
"He was suddenly struck too by the thought that Sonia
meant to go with him."
“What are you doing?
Where are you going?
"Stay here, stay!"
"I’ll go
alone,” he cried in cowardly vexation, and almost resentful, he moved
towards the door."
"“What’s the use of going in procession?” he muttered
going out."
Sonia remained standing in the middle of the room.
"He had not even said
good-bye to her; he had forgotten her."
"A poignant and rebellious doubt
surged in his heart."
"“Was it right, was it right, all this?” he thought again as he went down
the stairs."
"“Couldn’t he stop and retract it all... and not go?”

But still he went."
"He felt suddenly once for all that he mustn’t ask
himself questions."
"As he turned into the street he remembered that he
had not said good-bye to Sonia, that he had left her in the middle of
the room in her green shawl, not daring to stir after he had shouted
at her, and he stopped short for a moment."
"At the same instant, another
thought dawned upon him, as though it had been lying in wait to strike
him then."
"“Why, with what object did I go to her just now?"
"I told her--on
business; on what business?"
I had no sort of business!
"To tell her I was
_going_; but where was the need?"
Do I love her?
"No, no, I drove her away
just now like a dog."
Did I want her crosses?
"Oh, how low I’ve sunk!"
"No,
I wanted her tears, I wanted to see her terror, to see how her heart
ached!"
"I had to have something to cling to, something to delay me, some
friendly face to see!"
"And I dared to believe in myself, to dream of what
I would do!"
"I am a beggarly contemptible wretch, contemptible!”

He walked along the canal bank, and he had not much further to go."
"But
on reaching the bridge he stopped and turning out of his way along it
went to the Hay Market."
"He looked eagerly to right and left, gazed intently at every object and
could not fix his attention on anything; everything slipped away."
"“In
another week, another month I shall be driven in a prison van over this
bridge, how shall I look at the canal then?"
"I should like to remember
this!” slipped into his mind."
“Look at this sign!
"How shall I read those
letters then?"
"It’s written here ‘Campany,’ that’s a thing to remember,
that letter _a_, and to look at it again in a month--how shall I look
at it then?"
What shall I be feeling and thinking then?...
"How trivial
it all must be, what I am fretting about now!"
"Of course it must all be
interesting... in its way... (Ha-ha-ha!"
What am I thinking about?)
"I am
becoming a baby, I am showing off to myself; why am I ashamed?"
Foo!
"how
people shove!"
"that fat man--a German he must be--who pushed against
me, does he know whom he pushed?"
"There’s a peasant woman with a baby,
begging."
It’s curious that she thinks me happier than she is.
"I might
give her something, for the incongruity of it."
"Here’s a five copeck
piece left in my pocket, where did I get it?"
"Here, here... take it, my
good woman!”

“God bless you,” the beggar chanted in a lachrymose voice."
He went into the Hay Market.
"It was distasteful, very distasteful to be
in a crowd, but he walked just where he saw most people."
"He would have
given anything in the world to be alone; but he knew himself that he
would not have remained alone for a moment."
"There was a man drunk and
disorderly in the crowd; he kept trying to dance and falling down."
"There
was a ring round him."
"Raskolnikov squeezed his way through the crowd,
stared for some minutes at the drunken man and suddenly gave a short
jerky laugh."
"A minute later he had forgotten him and did not see him,
though he still stared."
"He moved away at last, not remembering where he
was; but when he got into the middle of the square an emotion suddenly
came over him, overwhelming him body and mind."
"He suddenly recalled Sonia’s words, “Go to the cross-roads, bow down to
the people, kiss the earth, for you have sinned against it too, and say
aloud to the whole world, ‘I am a murderer.’” He trembled, remembering
that."
"And the hopeless misery and anxiety of all that time, especially
of the last hours, had weighed so heavily upon him that he positively
clutched at the chance of this new unmixed, complete sensation."
"It came
over him like a fit; it was like a single spark kindled in his soul and
spreading fire through him."
"Everything in him softened at once and the
tears started into his eyes."
He fell to the earth on the spot....
"He knelt down in the middle of the square, bowed down to the earth, and
kissed that filthy earth with bliss and rapture."
"He got up and bowed
down a second time."
"“He’s boozed,” a youth near him observed."
There was a roar of laughter.
"“He’s going to Jerusalem, brothers, and saying good-bye to his children
and his country."
"He’s bowing down to all the world and kissing the great
city of St. Petersburg and its pavement,” added a workman who was a
little drunk."
"“Quite a young man, too!” observed a third."
"“And a gentleman,” someone observed soberly."
"“There’s no knowing who’s a gentleman and who isn’t nowadays.”

These exclamations and remarks checked Raskolnikov, and the words, “I am
a murderer,” which were perhaps on the point of dropping from his lips,
died away."
"He bore these remarks quietly, however, and, without looking
round, he turned down a street leading to the police office."
"He had a
glimpse of something on the way which did not surprise him; he had felt
that it must be so."
"The second time he bowed down in the Hay Market he
saw, standing fifty paces from him on the left, Sonia."
"She was hiding
from him behind one of the wooden shanties in the market-place."
"She had
followed him then on his painful way!"
"Raskolnikov at that moment felt
and knew once for all that Sonia was with him for ever and would follow
him to the ends of the earth, wherever fate might take him."
"It wrung his
heart... but he was just reaching the fatal place."
He went into the yard fairly resolutely.
"He had to mount to the third
storey."
"“I shall be some time going up,” he thought."
"He felt as though
the fateful moment was still far off, as though he had plenty of time
left for consideration."
"Again the same rubbish, the same eggshells lying about on the spiral
stairs, again the open doors of the flats, again the same kitchens and
the same fumes and stench coming from them."
"Raskolnikov had not been
here since that day."
"His legs were numb and gave way under him, but
still they moved forward."
"He stopped for a moment to take breath, to
collect himself, so as to enter _like a man_."
“But why?
"what for?” he
wondered, reflecting."
"“If I must drink the cup what difference does it
make?"
"The more revolting the better.” He imagined for an instant the
figure of the “explosive lieutenant,” Ilya Petrovitch."
"Was he actually
going to him?"
Couldn’t he go to someone else?
To Nikodim Fomitch?
Couldn’t he turn back and go straight to Nikodim Fomitch’s lodgings?
"At least then it would be done privately.... No, no!"
"To the “explosive
lieutenant”!"
"If he must drink it, drink it off at once."
"Turning cold and hardly conscious, he opened the door of the office."
"There were very few people in it this time--only a house porter and a
peasant."
The doorkeeper did not even peep out from behind his screen.
Raskolnikov walked into the next room.
"“Perhaps I still need not speak,”
 passed through his mind."
"Some sort of clerk not wearing a uniform was
settling himself at a bureau to write."
"In a corner another clerk was
seating himself."
"Zametov was not there, nor, of course, Nikodim Fomitch."
"“No one in?” Raskolnikov asked, addressing the person at the bureau."
"“Whom do you want?”

“A-ah!"
"Not a sound was heard, not a sight was seen, but I scent the
Russian... how does it go on in the fairy tale... I’ve forgotten!"
"‘At
your service!’” a familiar voice cried suddenly."
Raskolnikov shuddered.
The Explosive Lieutenant stood before him.
"He
had just come in from the third room."
"“It is the hand of fate,” thought
Raskolnikov."
"“Why is he here?”

“You’ve come to see us?"
What about?” cried Ilya Petrovitch.
"He
was obviously in an exceedingly good humour and perhaps a trifle
exhilarated."
“If it’s on business you are rather early.
"[*] It’s only a
chance that I am here... however I’ll do what I can."
"I must admit, I...
what is it, what is it?"
"Excuse me....”

     [*] Dostoevsky appears to have forgotten that it is after
     sunset, and that the last time Raskolnikov visited the
     police office at two in the afternoon he was reproached for
     coming too late.--TRANSLATOR."
"“Raskolnikov.”

“Of course, Raskolnikov."
You didn’t imagine I’d forgotten?
"Don’t think I
am like that... Rodion Ro--Ro--Rodionovitch, that’s it, isn’t it?”

“Rodion Romanovitch.”

“Yes, yes, of course, Rodion Romanovitch!"
I was just getting at it.
"I
made many inquiries about you."
"I assure you I’ve been genuinely grieved
since that... since I behaved like that... it was explained to me
afterwards that you were a literary man... and a learned one too... and
so to say the first steps... Mercy on us!"
"What literary or scientific
man does not begin by some originality of conduct!"
"My wife and I have
the greatest respect for literature, in my wife it’s a genuine passion!"
Literature and art!
"If only a man is a gentleman, all the rest can be
gained by talents, learning, good sense, genius."
"As for a hat--well,
what does a hat matter?"
"I can buy a hat as easily as I can a bun; but
what’s under the hat, what the hat covers, I can’t buy that!"
"I was even
meaning to come and apologise to you, but thought maybe you’d..."
"But I
am forgetting to ask you, is there anything you want really?"
"I hear your
family have come?”

“Yes, my mother and sister.”

“I’ve even had the honour and happiness of meeting your sister--a highly
cultivated and charming person."
"I confess I was sorry I got so hot with
you."
There it is!
"But as for my looking suspiciously at your fainting
fit--that affair has been cleared up splendidly!"
Bigotry and fanaticism!
I understand your indignation.
"Perhaps you are changing your lodging on
account of your family’s arriving?”

“No, I only looked in..."
I came to ask...
"I thought that I should find
Zametov here.”

“Oh, yes!"
"Of course, you’ve made friends, I heard."
"Well, no, Zametov is
not here."
"Yes, we’ve lost Zametov."
"He’s not been here since yesterday...
he quarrelled with everyone on leaving... in the rudest way."
"He is a
feather-headed youngster, that’s all; one might have expected something
from him, but there, you know what they are, our brilliant young men."
"He wanted to go in for some examination, but it’s only to talk and
boast about it, it will go no further than that."
"Of course it’s a very
different matter with you or Mr. Razumihin there, your friend."
"Your
career is an intellectual one and you won’t be deterred by failure."
"For
you, one may say, all the attractions of life _nihil est_--you are an
ascetic, a monk, a hermit!..."
"A book, a pen behind your ear, a learned
research--that’s where your spirit soars!"
"I am the same way myself....
Have you read Livingstone’s Travels?”

“No.”

“Oh, I have."
"There are a great many Nihilists about nowadays, you know,
and indeed it is not to be wondered at."
What sort of days are they?
"I
ask you."
But we thought... you are not a Nihilist of course?
"Answer me
openly, openly!”

“N-no...”

“Believe me, you can speak openly to me as you would to yourself!"
"Official duty is one thing but... you are thinking I meant to say
_friendship_ is quite another?"
"No, you’re wrong!"
"It’s not friendship,
but the feeling of a man and a citizen, the feeling of humanity and of
love for the Almighty."
"I may be an official, but I am always bound
to feel myself a man and a citizen.... You were asking about Zametov."
"Zametov will make a scandal in the French style in a house of bad
reputation, over a glass of champagne... that’s all your Zametov is good
for!"
"While I’m perhaps, so to speak, burning with devotion and lofty
feelings, and besides I have rank, consequence, a post!"
"I am married and
have children, I fulfil the duties of a man and a citizen, but who is
he, may I ask?"
"I appeal to you as a man ennobled by education... Then
these midwives, too, have become extraordinarily numerous.”

Raskolnikov raised his eyebrows inquiringly."
"The words of Ilya
Petrovitch, who had obviously been dining, were for the most part a
stream of empty sounds for him."
But some of them he understood.
"He
looked at him inquiringly, not knowing how it would end."
"“I mean those crop-headed wenches,” the talkative Ilya Petrovitch
continued."
“Midwives is my name for them.
"I think it a very satisfactory
one, ha-ha!"
"They go to the Academy, study anatomy."
"If I fall ill, am
I to send for a young lady to treat me?"
What do you say?
"Ha-ha!” Ilya
Petrovitch laughed, quite pleased with his own wit."
"“It’s an immoderate
zeal for education, but once you’re educated, that’s enough."
"Why abuse
it?"
"Why insult honourable people, as that scoundrel Zametov does?"
"Why
did he insult me, I ask you?"
"Look at these suicides, too, how common
they are, you can’t fancy!"
"People spend their last halfpenny and kill
themselves, boys and girls and old people."
"Only this morning we heard
about a gentleman who had just come to town."
"Nil Pavlitch, I say, what
was the name of that gentleman who shot himself?”

“Svidrigaïlov,” someone answered from the other room with drowsy
listlessness."
Raskolnikov started.
“Svidrigaïlov!
Svidrigaïlov has shot himself!” he cried.
"“What, do you know Svidrigaïlov?”

“Yes..."
I knew him....
"He hadn’t been here long.”

“Yes, that’s so."
"He had lost his wife, was a man of reckless habits and
all of a sudden shot himself, and in such a shocking way...."
"He left
in his notebook a few words: that he dies in full possession of his
faculties and that no one is to blame for his death."
"He had money, they
say."
"How did you come to know him?”

“I... was acquainted... my sister was governess in his family.”

“Bah-bah-bah!"
Then no doubt you can tell us something about him.
"You had
no suspicion?”

“I saw him yesterday... he... was drinking wine; I knew nothing.”

Raskolnikov felt as though something had fallen on him and was stifling
him."
“You’ve turned pale again.
"It’s so stuffy here...”

“Yes, I must go,” muttered Raskolnikov."
"“Excuse my troubling you....”

“Oh, not at all, as often as you like."
"It’s a pleasure to see you and I
am glad to say so.”

Ilya Petrovitch held out his hand."
“I only wanted...
"I came to see Zametov.”

“I understand, I understand, and it’s a pleasure to see you.”

“I... am very glad... good-bye,” Raskolnikov smiled."
"He went out; he reeled, he was overtaken with giddiness and did not know
what he was doing."
"He began going down the stairs, supporting himself
with his right hand against the wall."
"He fancied that a porter pushed
past him on his way upstairs to the police office, that a dog in
the lower storey kept up a shrill barking and that a woman flung a
rolling-pin at it and shouted."
He went down and out into the yard.
"There, not far from the entrance, stood Sonia, pale and horror-stricken."
She looked wildly at him.
He stood still before her.
"There was a look of
poignant agony, of despair, in her face."
She clasped her hands.
"His lips
worked in an ugly, meaningless smile."
"He stood still a minute, grinned
and went back to the police office."
Ilya Petrovitch had sat down and was rummaging among some papers.
"Before
him stood the same peasant who had pushed by on the stairs."
“Hulloa!
Back again!
have you left something behind?
"What’s the matter?”

Raskolnikov, with white lips and staring eyes, came slowly nearer."
"He walked right to the table, leaned his hand on it, tried to say
something, but could not; only incoherent sounds were audible."
"“You are feeling ill, a chair!"
"Here, sit down!"
"Some water!”

Raskolnikov dropped on to a chair, but he kept his eyes fixed on the
face of Ilya Petrovitch, which expressed unpleasant surprise."
"Both
looked at one another for a minute and waited."
Water was brought.
“It was I...” began Raskolnikov.
"“Drink some water.”

Raskolnikov refused the water with his hand, and softly and brokenly,
but distinctly said:

“_It was I killed the old pawnbroker woman and her sister Lizaveta with
an axe and robbed them._”

Ilya Petrovitch opened his mouth."
People ran up on all sides.
Raskolnikov repeated his statement.
"EPILOGUE

I

Siberia."
"On the banks of a broad solitary river stands a town, one of
the administrative centres of Russia; in the town there is a fortress,
in the fortress there is a prison."
"In the prison the second-class
convict Rodion Raskolnikov has been confined for nine months."
"Almost a
year and a half has passed since his crime."
There had been little difficulty about his trial.
"The criminal adhered
exactly, firmly, and clearly to his statement."
"He did not confuse nor
misrepresent the facts, nor soften them in his own interest, nor omit
the smallest detail."
"He explained every incident of the murder, the
secret of _the pledge_ (the piece of wood with a strip of metal) which
was found in the murdered woman’s hand."
"He described minutely how he
had taken her keys, what they were like, as well as the chest and its
contents; he explained the mystery of Lizaveta’s murder; described how
Koch and, after him, the student knocked, and repeated all they had said
to one another; how he afterwards had run downstairs and heard Nikolay
and Dmitri shouting; how he had hidden in the empty flat and afterwards
gone home."
"He ended by indicating the stone in the yard off the
Voznesensky Prospect under which the purse and the trinkets were found."
"The whole thing, in fact, was perfectly clear."
"The lawyers and the
judges were very much struck, among other things, by the fact that he
had hidden the trinkets and the purse under a stone, without making
use of them, and that, what was more, he did not now remember what the
trinkets were like, or even how many there were."
"The fact that he had
never opened the purse and did not even know how much was in it seemed
incredible."
"There turned out to be in the purse three hundred and
seventeen roubles and sixty copecks."
"From being so long under the stone,
some of the most valuable notes lying uppermost had suffered from the
damp."
"They were a long while trying to discover why the accused man
should tell a lie about this, when about everything else he had made
a truthful and straightforward confession."
"Finally some of the lawyers
more versed in psychology admitted that it was possible he had really
not looked into the purse, and so didn’t know what was in it when he
hid it under the stone."
"But they immediately drew the deduction that
the crime could only have been committed through temporary mental
derangement, through homicidal mania, without object or the pursuit of
gain."
"This fell in with the most recent fashionable theory of temporary
insanity, so often applied in our days in criminal cases."
"Moreover
Raskolnikov’s hypochondriacal condition was proved by many witnesses, by
Dr. Zossimov, his former fellow students, his landlady and her servant."
"All this pointed strongly to the conclusion that Raskolnikov was not
quite like an ordinary murderer and robber, but that there was another
element in the case."
"To the intense annoyance of those who maintained this opinion, the
criminal scarcely attempted to defend himself."
"To the decisive question
as to what motive impelled him to the murder and the robbery, he
answered very clearly with the coarsest frankness that the cause was
his miserable position, his poverty and helplessness, and his desire to
provide for his first steps in life by the help of the three thousand
roubles he had reckoned on finding."
"He had been led to the murder
through his shallow and cowardly nature, exasperated moreover by
privation and failure."
"To the question what led him to confess, he
answered that it was his heartfelt repentance."
"All this was almost
coarse...."
"The sentence however was more merciful than could have been expected,
perhaps partly because the criminal had not tried to justify himself,
but had rather shown a desire to exaggerate his guilt."
"All the strange
and peculiar circumstances of the crime were taken into consideration."
"There could be no doubt of the abnormal and poverty-stricken condition
of the criminal at the time."
"The fact that he had made no use of what he
had stolen was put down partly to the effect of remorse, partly to his
abnormal mental condition at the time of the crime."
"Incidentally the
murder of Lizaveta served indeed to confirm the last hypothesis: a man
commits two murders and forgets that the door is open!"
"Finally, the
confession, at the very moment when the case was hopelessly muddled by
the false evidence given by Nikolay through melancholy and fanaticism,
and when, moreover, there were no proofs against the real criminal, no
suspicions even (Porfiry Petrovitch fully kept his word)--all this did
much to soften the sentence."
"Other circumstances, too, in the prisoner’s
favour came out quite unexpectedly."
"Razumihin somehow discovered and
proved that while Raskolnikov was at the university he had helped a poor
consumptive fellow student and had spent his last penny on supporting
him for six months, and when this student died, leaving a decrepit
old father whom he had maintained almost from his thirteenth year,
Raskolnikov had got the old man into a hospital and paid for his funeral
when he died."
"Raskolnikov’s landlady bore witness, too, that when they
had lived in another house at Five Corners, Raskolnikov had rescued two
little children from a house on fire and was burnt in doing so."
"This was
investigated and fairly well confirmed by many witnesses."
"These facts
made an impression in his favour."
"And in the end the criminal was, in consideration of extenuating
circumstances, condemned to penal servitude in the second class for a
term of eight years only."
"At the very beginning of the trial Raskolnikov’s mother fell ill. Dounia
and Razumihin found it possible to get her out of Petersburg during the
trial."
"Razumihin chose a town on the railway not far from Petersburg, so
as to be able to follow every step of the trial and at the same time
to see Avdotya Romanovna as often as possible."
"Pulcheria Alexandrovna’s
illness was a strange nervous one and was accompanied by a partial
derangement of her intellect."
"When Dounia returned from her last interview with her brother, she
had found her mother already ill, in feverish delirium."
"That evening
Razumihin and she agreed what answers they must make to her mother’s
questions about Raskolnikov and made up a complete story for her
mother’s benefit of his having to go away to a distant part of Russia
on a business commission, which would bring him in the end money and
reputation."
"But they were struck by the fact that Pulcheria Alexandrovna never
asked them anything on the subject, neither then nor thereafter."
"On the
contrary, she had her own version of her son’s sudden departure; she
told them with tears how he had come to say good-bye to her, hinting
that she alone knew many mysterious and important facts, and that Rodya
had many very powerful enemies, so that it was necessary for him to be
in hiding."
"As for his future career, she had no doubt that it would be
brilliant when certain sinister influences could be removed."
"She assured
Razumihin that her son would be one day a great statesman, that his
article and brilliant literary talent proved it."
"This article she was
continually reading, she even read it aloud, almost took it to bed
with her, but scarcely asked where Rodya was, though the subject was
obviously avoided by the others, which might have been enough to awaken
her suspicions."
"They began to be frightened at last at Pulcheria Alexandrovna’s strange
silence on certain subjects."
"She did not, for instance, complain of
getting no letters from him, though in previous years she had only lived
on the hope of letters from her beloved Rodya."
"This was the cause of
great uneasiness to Dounia; the idea occurred to her that her mother
suspected that there was something terrible in her son’s fate and was
afraid to ask, for fear of hearing something still more awful."
"In any
case, Dounia saw clearly that her mother was not in full possession of
her faculties."
"It happened once or twice, however, that Pulcheria Alexandrovna gave
such a turn to the conversation that it was impossible to answer her
without mentioning where Rodya was, and on receiving unsatisfactory and
suspicious answers she became at once gloomy and silent, and this mood
lasted for a long time."
"Dounia saw at last that it was hard to deceive
her and came to the conclusion that it was better to be absolutely
silent on certain points; but it became more and more evident that
the poor mother suspected something terrible."
"Dounia remembered her
brother’s telling her that her mother had overheard her talking in her
sleep on the night after her interview with Svidrigaïlov and before the
fatal day of the confession: had not she made out something from that?"
"Sometimes days and even weeks of gloomy silence and tears would be
succeeded by a period of hysterical animation, and the invalid would
begin to talk almost incessantly of her son, of her hopes of his
future...."
Her fancies were sometimes very strange.
"They humoured her,
pretended to agree with her (she saw perhaps that they were pretending),
but she still went on talking."
"Five months after Raskolnikov’s confession, he was sentenced."
"Razumihin
and Sonia saw him in prison as often as it was possible."
"At last
the moment of separation came."
"Dounia swore to her brother that the
separation should not be for ever, Razumihin did the same."
"Razumihin, in
his youthful ardour, had firmly resolved to lay the foundations at least
of a secure livelihood during the next three or four years, and saving
up a certain sum, to emigrate to Siberia, a country rich in every
natural resource and in need of workers, active men and capital."
"There
they would settle in the town where Rodya was and all together would
begin a new life."
They all wept at parting.
Raskolnikov had been very dreamy for a few days before.
"He asked a great
deal about his mother and was constantly anxious about her."
"He worried
so much about her that it alarmed Dounia."
"When he heard about his
mother’s illness he became very gloomy."
"With Sonia he was particularly
reserved all the time."
"With the help of the money left to her by
Svidrigaïlov, Sonia had long ago made her preparations to follow the
party of convicts in which he was despatched to Siberia."
"Not a word
passed between Raskolnikov and her on the subject, but both knew it
would be so."
"At the final leave-taking he smiled strangely at his
sister’s and Razumihin’s fervent anticipations of their happy future
together when he should come out of prison."
"He predicted that their
mother’s illness would soon have a fatal ending."
"Sonia and he at last
set off."
Two months later Dounia was married to Razumihin.
"It was a quiet and
sorrowful wedding; Porfiry Petrovitch and Zossimov were invited however."
During all this period Razumihin wore an air of resolute determination.
"Dounia put implicit faith in his carrying out his plans and indeed she
could not but believe in him."
He displayed a rare strength of will.
"Among other things he began attending university lectures again in order
to take his degree."
"They were continually making plans for the future;
both counted on settling in Siberia within five years at least."
"Till
then they rested their hopes on Sonia."
"Pulcheria Alexandrovna was delighted to give her blessing to Dounia’s
marriage with Razumihin; but after the marriage she became even more
melancholy and anxious."
"To give her pleasure Razumihin told her how
Raskolnikov had looked after the poor student and his decrepit father
and how a year ago he had been burnt and injured in rescuing two
little children from a fire."
"These two pieces of news excited Pulcheria
Alexandrovna’s disordered imagination almost to ecstasy."
"She was
continually talking about them, even entering into conversation with
strangers in the street, though Dounia always accompanied her."
"In public
conveyances and shops, wherever she could capture a listener, she would
begin the discourse about her son, his article, how he had helped the
student, how he had been burnt at the fire, and so on!"
"Dounia did
not know how to restrain her."
"Apart from the danger of her morbid
excitement, there was the risk of someone’s recalling Raskolnikov’s name
and speaking of the recent trial."
"Pulcheria Alexandrovna found out the
address of the mother of the two children her son had saved and insisted
on going to see her."
At last her restlessness reached an extreme point.
"She would sometimes
begin to cry suddenly and was often ill and feverishly delirious."
"One
morning she declared that by her reckoning Rodya ought soon to be home,
that she remembered when he said good-bye to her he said that they must
expect him back in nine months."
"She began to prepare for his coming,
began to do up her room for him, to clean the furniture, to wash and
put up new hangings and so on."
"Dounia was anxious, but said nothing and
helped her to arrange the room."
"After a fatiguing day spent in continual
fancies, in joyful day-dreams and tears, Pulcheria Alexandrovna was
taken ill in the night and by morning she was feverish and delirious."
It was brain fever.
She died within a fortnight.
"In her delirium she
dropped words which showed that she knew a great deal more about her
son’s terrible fate than they had supposed."
"For a long time Raskolnikov did not know of his mother’s death, though
a regular correspondence had been maintained from the time he reached
Siberia."
"It was carried on by means of Sonia, who wrote every month
to the Razumihins and received an answer with unfailing regularity."
"At
first they found Sonia’s letters dry and unsatisfactory, but later on
they came to the conclusion that the letters could not be better, for
from these letters they received a complete picture of their unfortunate
brother’s life."
"Sonia’s letters were full of the most matter-of-fact
detail, the simplest and clearest description of all Raskolnikov’s
surroundings as a convict."
"There was no word of her own hopes, no
conjecture as to the future, no description of her feelings."
"Instead of
any attempt to interpret his state of mind and inner life, she gave the
simple facts--that is, his own words, an exact account of his health,
what he asked for at their interviews, what commission he gave her
and so on."
All these facts she gave with extraordinary minuteness.
"The
picture of their unhappy brother stood out at last with great clearness
and precision."
"There could be no mistake, because nothing was given but
facts."
"But Dounia and her husband could get little comfort out of the news,
especially at first."
"Sonia wrote that he was constantly sullen and not
ready to talk, that he scarcely seemed interested in the news she gave
him from their letters, that he sometimes asked after his mother and
that when, seeing that he had guessed the truth, she told him at last
of her death, she was surprised to find that he did not seem greatly
affected by it, not externally at any rate."
"She told them that, although
he seemed so wrapped up in himself and, as it were, shut himself off
from everyone--he took a very direct and simple view of his new life;
that he understood his position, expected nothing better for the time,
had no ill-founded hopes (as is so common in his position) and scarcely
seemed surprised at anything in his surroundings, so unlike anything he
had known before."
"She wrote that his health was satisfactory; he did his
work without shirking or seeking to do more; he was almost indifferent
about food, but except on Sundays and holidays the food was so bad that
at last he had been glad to accept some money from her, Sonia, to have
his own tea every day."
"He begged her not to trouble about anything else,
declaring that all this fuss about him only annoyed him."
"Sonia wrote
further that in prison he shared the same room with the rest, that she
had not seen the inside of their barracks, but concluded that they were
crowded, miserable and unhealthy; that he slept on a plank bed with a
rug under him and was unwilling to make any other arrangement."
"But that
he lived so poorly and roughly, not from any plan or design, but simply
from inattention and indifference."
"Sonia wrote simply that he had at first shown no interest in her visits,
had almost been vexed with her indeed for coming, unwilling to talk and
rude to her."
"But that in the end these visits had become a habit and
almost a necessity for him, so that he was positively distressed when
she was ill for some days and could not visit him."
"She used to see him
on holidays at the prison gates or in the guard-room, to which he was
brought for a few minutes to see her."
"On working days she would go to
see him at work either at the workshops or at the brick kilns, or at the
sheds on the banks of the Irtish."
"About herself, Sonia wrote that she had succeeded in making some
acquaintances in the town, that she did sewing, and, as there
was scarcely a dressmaker in the town, she was looked upon as an
indispensable person in many houses."
"But she did not mention that the
authorities were, through her, interested in Raskolnikov; that his task
was lightened and so on."
"At last the news came (Dounia had indeed noticed signs of alarm and
uneasiness in the preceding letters) that he held aloof from everyone,
that his fellow prisoners did not like him, that he kept silent for days
at a time and was becoming very pale."
"In the last letter Sonia wrote
that he had been taken very seriously ill and was in the convict ward of
the hospital."
"II

He was ill a long time."
"But it was not the horrors of prison life, not
the hard labour, the bad food, the shaven head, or the patched clothes
that crushed him."
What did he care for all those trials and hardships!
he was even glad of the hard work.
"Physically exhausted, he could at
least reckon on a few hours of quiet sleep."
"And what was the food to
him--the thin cabbage soup with beetles floating in it?"
"In the past as a
student he had often not had even that."
"His clothes were warm and suited
to his manner of life."
He did not even feel the fetters.
"Was he ashamed
of his shaven head and parti-coloured coat?"
Before whom?
Before Sonia?
"Sonia was afraid of him, how could he be ashamed before her?"
"And yet he
was ashamed even before Sonia, whom he tortured because of it with
his contemptuous rough manner."
"But it was not his shaven head and his
fetters he was ashamed of: his pride had been stung to the quick."
"It was
wounded pride that made him ill. Oh, how happy he would have been if he
could have blamed himself!"
"He could have borne anything then, even
shame and disgrace."
"But he judged himself severely, and his exasperated
conscience found no particularly terrible fault in his past, except
a simple _blunder_ which might happen to anyone."
"He was ashamed just
because he, Raskolnikov, had so hopelessly, stupidly come to grief
through some decree of blind fate, and must humble himself and submit to
“the idiocy” of a sentence, if he were anyhow to be at peace."
"Vague and objectless anxiety in the present, and in the future a
continual sacrifice leading to nothing--that was all that lay before
him."
"And what comfort was it to him that at the end of eight years he
would only be thirty-two and able to begin a new life!"
"What had he to
live for?"
What had he to look forward to?
Why should he strive?
"To live
in order to exist?"
"Why, he had been ready a thousand times before to
give up existence for the sake of an idea, for a hope, even for a fancy."
"Mere existence had always been too little for him; he had always wanted
more."
"Perhaps it was just because of the strength of his desires that he
had thought himself a man to whom more was permissible than to others."
"And if only fate would have sent him repentance--burning repentance that
would have torn his heart and robbed him of sleep, that repentance, the
awful agony of which brings visions of hanging or drowning!"
"Oh, he would
have been glad of it!"
Tears and agonies would at least have been life.
But he did not repent of his crime.
"At least he might have found relief in raging at his stupidity, as he
had raged at the grotesque blunders that had brought him to prison."
"But now in prison, _in freedom_, he thought over and criticised all his
actions again and by no means found them so blundering and so grotesque
as they had seemed at the fatal time."
"“In what way,” he asked himself, “was my theory stupider than others
that have swarmed and clashed from the beginning of the world?"
"One has
only to look at the thing quite independently, broadly, and uninfluenced
by commonplace ideas, and my idea will by no means seem so... strange."
"Oh, sceptics and halfpenny philosophers, why do you halt half-way!"
“Why does my action strike them as so horrible?” he said to himself.
"“Is
it because it was a crime?"
What is meant by crime?
"My conscience is at
rest."
"Of course, it was a legal crime, of course, the letter of the law
was broken and blood was shed."
"Well, punish me for the letter of the
law... and that’s enough."
"Of course, in that case many of the
benefactors of mankind who snatched power for themselves instead of
inheriting it ought to have been punished at their first steps."
"But
those men succeeded and so _they were right_, and I didn’t, and so I
had no right to have taken that step.”

It was only in that that he recognised his criminality, only in the fact
that he had been unsuccessful and had confessed it."
He suffered too from the question: why had he not killed himself?
"Why
had he stood looking at the river and preferred to confess?"
"Was the
desire to live so strong and was it so hard to overcome it?"
"Had not
Svidrigaïlov overcome it, although he was afraid of death?"
"In misery he asked himself this question, and could not understand that,
at the very time he had been standing looking into the river, he had
perhaps been dimly conscious of the fundamental falsity in himself and
his convictions."
"He didn’t understand that that consciousness might be
the promise of a future crisis, of a new view of life and of his future
resurrection."
"He preferred to attribute it to the dead weight of instinct which he
could not step over, again through weakness and meanness."
"He looked at
his fellow prisoners and was amazed to see how they all loved life and
prized it."
"It seemed to him that they loved and valued life more in
prison than in freedom."
"What terrible agonies and privations some of
them, the tramps for instance, had endured!"
"Could they care so much for
a ray of sunshine, for the primeval forest, the cold spring hidden away
in some unseen spot, which the tramp had marked three years before, and
longed to see again, as he might to see his sweetheart, dreaming of the
green grass round it and the bird singing in the bush?"
"As he went on he
saw still more inexplicable examples."
"In prison, of course, there was a great deal he did not see and did not
want to see; he lived as it were with downcast eyes."
"It was loathsome
and unbearable for him to look."
"But in the end there was much that
surprised him and he began, as it were involuntarily, to notice much
that he had not suspected before."
"What surprised him most of all was
the terrible impossible gulf that lay between him and all the rest."
"They
seemed to be a different species, and he looked at them and they at
him with distrust and hostility."
"He felt and knew the reasons of his
isolation, but he would never have admitted till then that those reasons
were so deep and strong."
"There were some Polish exiles, political
prisoners, among them."
"They simply looked down upon all the rest as
ignorant churls; but Raskolnikov could not look upon them like that."
"He saw that these ignorant men were in many respects far wiser than the
Poles."
"There were some Russians who were just as contemptuous, a former
officer and two seminarists."
Raskolnikov saw their mistake as clearly.
"He was disliked and avoided by everyone; they even began to hate him at
last--why, he could not tell."
"Men who had been far more guilty despised
and laughed at his crime."
"“You’re a gentleman,” they used to say."
"“You shouldn’t hack about with
an axe; that’s not a gentleman’s work.”

The second week in Lent, his turn came to take the sacrament with his
gang."
He went to church and prayed with the others.
"A quarrel broke out
one day, he did not know how."
All fell on him at once in a fury.
“You’re an infidel!
"You don’t believe in God,” they shouted."
"“You ought
to be killed.”

He had never talked to them about God nor his belief, but they wanted to
kill him as an infidel."
He said nothing.
"One of the prisoners rushed at
him in a perfect frenzy."
"Raskolnikov awaited him calmly and silently;
his eyebrows did not quiver, his face did not flinch."
"The guard
succeeded in intervening between him and his assailant, or there would
have been bloodshed."
"There was another question he could not decide: why were they all so
fond of Sonia?"
"She did not try to win their favour; she rarely met
them, sometimes only she came to see him at work for a moment."
"And yet
everybody knew her, they knew that she had come out to follow _him_,
knew how and where she lived."
"She never gave them money, did them no
particular services."
"Only once at Christmas she sent them all presents
of pies and rolls."
"But by degrees closer relations sprang up between
them and Sonia."
"She would write and post letters for them to their
relations."
"Relations of the prisoners who visited the town, at their
instructions, left with Sonia presents and money for them."
"Their wives
and sweethearts knew her and used to visit her."
"And when she visited
Raskolnikov at work, or met a party of the prisoners on the road, they
all took off their hats to her."
"“Little mother Sofya Semyonovna, you
are our dear, good little mother,” coarse branded criminals said to that
frail little creature."
"She would smile and bow to them and everyone was
delighted when she smiled."
"They even admired her gait and turned round
to watch her walking; they admired her too for being so little, and, in
fact, did not know what to admire her most for."
"They even came to her
for help in their illnesses."
He was in the hospital from the middle of Lent till after Easter.
"When
he was better, he remembered the dreams he had had while he was feverish
and delirious."
"He dreamt that the whole world was condemned to a
terrible new strange plague that had come to Europe from the depths of
Asia."
All were to be destroyed except a very few chosen.
"Some new sorts
of microbes were attacking the bodies of men, but these microbes were
endowed with intelligence and will."
"Men attacked by them became at once
mad and furious."
"But never had men considered themselves so intellectual
and so completely in possession of the truth as these sufferers, never
had they considered their decisions, their scientific conclusions, their
moral convictions so infallible."
"Whole villages, whole towns and peoples
went mad from the infection."
"All were excited and did not understand
one another."
"Each thought that he alone had the truth and was wretched
looking at the others, beat himself on the breast, wept, and wrung
his hands."
"They did not know how to judge and could not agree what to
consider evil and what good; they did not know whom to blame, whom
to justify."
Men killed each other in a sort of senseless spite.
"They
gathered together in armies against one another, but even on the march
the armies would begin attacking each other, the ranks would be broken
and the soldiers would fall on each other, stabbing and cutting, biting
and devouring each other."
"The alarm bell was ringing all day long in
the towns; men rushed together, but why they were summoned and who was
summoning them no one knew."
"The most ordinary trades were abandoned,
because everyone proposed his own ideas, his own improvements, and they
could not agree."
The land too was abandoned.
"Men met in groups, agreed
on something, swore to keep together, but at once began on something
quite different from what they had proposed."
"They accused one another,
fought and killed each other."
There were conflagrations and famine.
"All
men and all things were involved in destruction."
"The plague spread and
moved further and further."
"Only a few men could be saved in the whole
world."
"They were a pure chosen people, destined to found a new race and
a new life, to renew and purify the earth, but no one had seen these
men, no one had heard their words and their voices."
"Raskolnikov was worried that this senseless dream haunted his memory so
miserably, the impression of this feverish delirium persisted so long."
The second week after Easter had come.
"There were warm bright spring
days; in the prison ward the grating windows under which the sentinel
paced were opened."
"Sonia had only been able to visit him twice during
his illness; each time she had to obtain permission, and it was
difficult."
"But she often used to come to the hospital yard, especially
in the evening, sometimes only to stand a minute and look up at the
windows of the ward."
"One evening, when he was almost well again, Raskolnikov fell asleep."
"On
waking up he chanced to go to the window, and at once saw Sonia in the
distance at the hospital gate."
She seemed to be waiting for someone.
Something stabbed him to the heart at that minute.
"He shuddered and
moved away from the window."
"Next day Sonia did not come, nor the day
after; he noticed that he was expecting her uneasily."
"At last he was
discharged."
"On reaching the prison he learnt from the convicts that
Sofya Semyonovna was lying ill at home and was unable to go out."
"He was very uneasy and sent to inquire after her; he soon learnt that
her illness was not dangerous."
"Hearing that he was anxious about her,
Sonia sent him a pencilled note, telling him that she was much better,
that she had a slight cold and that she would soon, very soon come and
see him at his work."
His heart throbbed painfully as he read it.
Again it was a warm bright day.
"Early in the morning, at six o’clock, he
went off to work on the river bank, where they used to pound alabaster
and where there was a kiln for baking it in a shed."
"There were only
three of them sent."
"One of the convicts went with the guard to the
fortress to fetch a tool; the other began getting the wood ready and
laying it in the kiln."
"Raskolnikov came out of the shed on to the river
bank, sat down on a heap of logs by the shed and began gazing at the
wide deserted river."
"From the high bank a broad landscape opened before
him, the sound of singing floated faintly audible from the other bank."
"In the vast steppe, bathed in sunshine, he could just see, like black
specks, the nomads’ tents."
"There there was freedom, there other men were
living, utterly unlike those here; there time itself seemed to stand
still, as though the age of Abraham and his flocks had not passed."
"Raskolnikov sat gazing, his thoughts passed into day-dreams, into
contemplation; he thought of nothing, but a vague restlessness excited
and troubled him."
"Suddenly he found Sonia beside him; she had come up
noiselessly and sat down at his side."
"It was still quite early; the
morning chill was still keen."
"She wore her poor old burnous and the
green shawl; her face still showed signs of illness, it was thinner and
paler."
"She gave him a joyful smile of welcome, but held out her hand
with her usual timidity."
"She was always timid of holding out her hand
to him and sometimes did not offer it at all, as though afraid he would
repel it."
"He always took her hand as though with repugnance, always
seemed vexed to meet her and was sometimes obstinately silent throughout
her visit."
"Sometimes she trembled before him and went away deeply
grieved."
But now their hands did not part.
"He stole a rapid glance
at her and dropped his eyes on the ground without speaking."
"They were
alone, no one had seen them."
The guard had turned away for the time.
How it happened he did not know.
"But all at once something seemed to
seize him and fling him at her feet."
"He wept and threw his arms round
her knees."
"For the first instant she was terribly frightened and she
turned pale."
She jumped up and looked at him trembling.
"But at the same
moment she understood, and a light of infinite happiness came into her
eyes."
"She knew and had no doubt that he loved her beyond everything and
that at last the moment had come...."
"They wanted to speak, but could not; tears stood in their eyes."
"They
were both pale and thin; but those sick pale faces were bright with the
dawn of a new future, of a full resurrection into a new life."
"They were
renewed by love; the heart of each held infinite sources of life for the
heart of the other."
They resolved to wait and be patient.
"They had another seven years to
wait, and what terrible suffering and what infinite happiness before
them!"
"But he had risen again and he knew it and felt it in all his
being, while she--she only lived in his life."
"On the evening of the same day, when the barracks were locked,
Raskolnikov lay on his plank bed and thought of her."
"He had even fancied
that day that all the convicts who had been his enemies looked at him
differently; he had even entered into talk with them and they answered
him in a friendly way."
"He remembered that now, and thought it was bound
to be so."
Wasn’t everything now bound to be changed?
He thought of her.
"He remembered how continually he had tormented her
and wounded her heart."
He remembered her pale and thin little face.
"But these recollections scarcely troubled him now; he knew with what
infinite love he would now repay all her sufferings."
"And what were all,
_all_ the agonies of the past!"
"Everything, even his crime, his sentence
and imprisonment, seemed to him now in the first rush of feeling an
external, strange fact with which he had no concern."
"But he could not
think for long together of anything that evening, and he could not have
analysed anything consciously; he was simply feeling."
"Life had stepped
into the place of theory and something quite different would work itself
out in his mind."
Under his pillow lay the New Testament.
He took it up mechanically.
"The book belonged to Sonia; it was the one from which she had read the
raising of Lazarus to him."
"At first he was afraid that she would worry
him about religion, would talk about the gospel and pester him with
books."
"But to his great surprise she had not once approached the subject
and had not even offered him the Testament."
"He had asked her for it
himself not long before his illness and she brought him the book without
a word."
Till now he had not opened it.
"He did not open it now, but one thought passed through his mind: “Can
her convictions not be mine now?"
"Her feelings, her aspirations at
least....”

She too had been greatly agitated that day, and at night she was taken
ill again."
"But she was so happy--and so unexpectedly happy--that she was
almost frightened of her happiness."
"Seven years, _only_ seven years!"
"At
the beginning of their happiness at some moments they were both ready
to look on those seven years as though they were seven days."
"He did not
know that the new life would not be given him for nothing, that he would
have to pay dearly for it, that it would cost him great striving, great
suffering."
"But that is the beginning of a new story--the story of the gradual
renewal of a man, the story of his gradual regeneration, of his passing
from one world into another, of his initiation into a new unknown life."
"That might be the subject of a new story, but our present story is
ended."
"﻿PART I

I."
"Towards the end of November, during a thaw, at nine o’clock one morning,
a train on the Warsaw and Petersburg railway was approaching the latter
city at full speed."
"The morning was so damp and misty that it was only
with great difficulty that the day succeeded in breaking; and it was
impossible to distinguish anything more than a few yards away from the
carriage windows."
"Some of the passengers by this particular train were returning from
abroad; but the third-class carriages were the best filled, chiefly with
insignificant persons of various occupations and degrees, picked up at
the different stations nearer town."
"All of them seemed weary, and
most of them had sleepy eyes and a shivering expression, while their
complexions generally appeared to have taken on the colour of the fog
outside."
"When day dawned, two passengers in one of the third-class carriages
found themselves opposite each other."
"Both were young fellows, both
were rather poorly dressed, both had remarkable faces, and both were
evidently anxious to start a conversation."
"If they had but known why,
at this particular moment, they were both remarkable persons, they would
undoubtedly have wondered at the strange chance which had set them down
opposite to one another in a third-class carriage of the Warsaw Railway
Company."
"One of them was a young fellow of about twenty-seven, not tall, with
black curling hair, and small, grey, fiery eyes."
"His nose was broad
and flat, and he had high cheek bones; his thin lips were constantly
compressed into an impudent, ironical--it might almost be called a
malicious--smile; but his forehead was high and well formed, and atoned
for a good deal of the ugliness of the lower part of his face."
"A special
feature of this physiognomy was its death-like pallor, which gave to
the whole man an indescribably emaciated appearance in spite of his hard
look, and at the same time a sort of passionate and suffering expression
which did not harmonize with his impudent, sarcastic smile and
keen, self-satisfied bearing."
"He wore a large fur--or rather
astrachan--overcoat, which had kept him warm all night, while his
neighbour had been obliged to bear the full severity of a Russian
November night entirely unprepared."
"His wide sleeveless mantle with a
large cape to it--the sort of cloak one sees upon travellers during the
winter months in Switzerland or North Italy--was by no means adapted to
the long cold journey through Russia, from Eydkuhnen to St. Petersburg."
"The wearer of this cloak was a young fellow, also of about twenty-six or
twenty-seven years of age, slightly above the middle height, very fair,
with a thin, pointed and very light coloured beard; his eyes were large
and blue, and had an intent look about them, yet that heavy expression
which some people affirm to be a peculiarity as well as evidence, of an
epileptic subject."
"His face was decidedly a pleasant one for all that;
refined, but quite colourless, except for the circumstance that at this
moment it was blue with cold."
"He held a bundle made up of an old faded
silk handkerchief that apparently contained all his travelling wardrobe,
and wore thick shoes and gaiters, his whole appearance being very
un-Russian."
"His black-haired neighbour inspected these peculiarities, having nothing
better to do, and at length remarked, with that rude enjoyment of the
discomforts of others which the common classes so often show:

“Cold?”

“Very,” said his neighbour, readily, “and this is a thaw, too."
"Fancy if
it had been a hard frost!"
"I never thought it would be so cold in the old
country."
"I’ve grown quite out of the way of it.”

“What, been abroad, I suppose?”

“Yes, straight from Switzerland.”

“Wheugh!"
"my goodness!” The black-haired young fellow whistled, and then
laughed."
The conversation proceeded.
"The readiness of the fair-haired young
man in the cloak to answer all his opposite neighbour’s questions
was surprising."
"He seemed to have no suspicion of any impertinence
or inappropriateness in the fact of such questions being put to him."
"Replying to them, he made known to the inquirer that he certainly had
been long absent from Russia, more than four years; that he had been
sent abroad for his health; that he had suffered from some strange
nervous malady--a kind of epilepsy, with convulsive spasms."
"His
interlocutor burst out laughing several times at his answers; and
more than ever, when to the question, “whether he had been cured?” the
patient replied:

“No, they did not cure me.”

“Hey!"
that’s it!
"You stumped up your money for nothing, and we
believe in those fellows, here!” remarked the black-haired individual,
sarcastically."
"“Gospel truth, sir, Gospel truth!” exclaimed another passenger, a
shabbily dressed man of about forty, who looked like a clerk, and
possessed a red nose and a very blotchy face."
“Gospel truth!
"All they do
is to get hold of our good Russian money free, gratis, and for nothing.”

“Oh, but you’re quite wrong in my particular instance,” said the Swiss
patient, quietly."
"“Of course I can’t argue the matter, because I
know only my own case; but my doctor gave me money--and he had very
little--to pay my journey back, besides having kept me at his own
expense, while there, for nearly two years.”

“Why?"
Was there no one else to pay for you?” asked the black-haired one.
"“No--Mr. Pavlicheff, who had been supporting me there, died a couple
of years ago."
"I wrote to Mrs. General Epanchin at the time (she is a
distant relative of mine), but she did not answer my letter."
"And so
eventually I came back.”

“And where have you come to?”

“That is--where am I going to stay?"
"I--I really don’t quite know yet,
I--”

Both the listeners laughed again."
"“I suppose your whole set-up is in that bundle, then?” asked the first."
"“I bet anything it is!” exclaimed the red-nosed passenger, with
extreme satisfaction, “and that he has precious little in the luggage
van!--though of course poverty is no crime--we must remember that!”

It appeared that it was indeed as they had surmised."
"The young fellow
hastened to admit the fact with wonderful readiness."
"“Your bundle has some importance, however,” continued the clerk, when
they had laughed their fill (it was observable that the subject of their
mirth joined in the laughter when he saw them laughing); “for though I
dare say it is not stuffed full of friedrichs d’or and louis d’or--judge
from your costume and gaiters--still--if you can add to your possessions
such a valuable property as a relation like Mrs. General Epanchin, then
your bundle becomes a significant object at once."
"That is, of course, if
you really are a relative of Mrs. Epanchin’s, and have not made a little
error through--well, absence of mind, which is very common to human
beings; or, say--through a too luxuriant fancy?”

“Oh, you are right again,” said the fair-haired traveller, “for I
really am _almost_ wrong when I say she and I are related."
"She is hardly
a relation at all; so little, in fact, that I was not in the least
surprised to have no answer to my letter."
"I expected as much.”

“H’m!"
"you spent your postage for nothing, then."
H’m!
"you are candid,
however--and that is commendable."
H’m!
Mrs. Epanchin--oh yes!
"a most
eminent person."
I know her.
"As for Mr. Pavlicheff, who supported you in
Switzerland, I know him too--at least, if it was Nicolai Andreevitch
of that name?"
"A fine fellow he was--and had a property of four thousand
souls in his day.”

“Yes, Nicolai Andreevitch--that was his name,” and the young fellow
looked earnestly and with curiosity at the all-knowing gentleman with
the red nose."
This sort of character is met with pretty frequently in a certain class.
"They are people who know everyone--that is, they know where a man is
employed, what his salary is, whom he knows, whom he married, what money
his wife had, who are his cousins, and second cousins, etc., etc."
"These
men generally have about a hundred pounds a year to live on, and they
spend their whole time and talents in the amassing of this style of
knowledge, which they reduce--or raise--to the standard of a science."
"During the latter part of the conversation the black-haired young man
had become very impatient."
"He stared out of the window, and fidgeted,
and evidently longed for the end of the journey."
"He was very absent;
he would appear to listen--and heard nothing; and he would laugh of a
sudden, evidently with no idea of what he was laughing about."
"“Excuse me,” said the red-nosed man to the young fellow with the bundle,
rather suddenly; “whom have I the honour to be talking to?”

“Prince Lef Nicolaievitch Muishkin,” replied the latter, with perfect
readiness."
“Prince Muishkin?
Lef Nicolaievitch?
H’m!
"I don’t know, I’m sure!"
"I may
say I have never heard of such a person,” said the clerk, thoughtfully."
"“At least, the name, I admit, is historical."
"Karamsin must mention the
family name, of course, in his history--but as an individual--one never
hears of any Prince Muishkin nowadays.”

“Of course not,” replied the prince; “there are none, except myself."
I believe I am the last and only one.
"As to my forefathers, they have
always been a poor lot; my own father was a sublieutenant in the army."
"I
don’t know how Mrs. Epanchin comes into the Muishkin family, but she is
descended from the Princess Muishkin, and she, too, is the last of her
line.”

“And did you learn science and all that, with your professor over
there?” asked the black-haired passenger."
"“Oh yes--I did learn a little, but--”

“I’ve never learned anything whatever,” said the other."
"“Oh, but I learned very little, you know!” added the prince, as though
excusing himself."
"“They could not teach me very much on account of my
illness.”

“Do you know the Rogojins?” asked his questioner, abruptly."
"“No, I don’t--not at all!"
I hardly know anyone in Russia.
"Why, is that
your name?”

“Yes, I am Rogojin, Parfen Rogojin.”

“Parfen Rogojin?"
"dear me--then don’t you belong to those very Rogojins,
perhaps--” began the clerk, with a very perceptible increase of civility
in his tone."
"“Yes--those very ones,” interrupted Rogojin, impatiently, and with scant
courtesy."
"I may remark that he had not once taken any notice of the
blotchy-faced passenger, and had hitherto addressed all his remarks
direct to the prince."
"“Dear me--is it possible?” observed the clerk, while his face assumed an
expression of great deference and servility--if not of absolute
alarm: “what, a son of that very Semen Rogojin--hereditary honourable
citizen--who died a month or so ago and left two million and a half of
roubles?”

“And how do _you_ know that he left two million and a half of roubles?”
 asked Rogojin, disdainfully, and not deigning so much as to look at the
other."
"“However, it’s true enough that my father died a month ago, and
that here am I returning from Pskoff, a month after, with hardly a boot
to my foot."
They’ve treated me like a dog!
"I’ve been ill of fever at
Pskoff the whole time, and not a line, nor farthing of money, have I
received from my mother or my confounded brother!”

“And now you’ll have a million roubles, at least--goodness gracious me!”
 exclaimed the clerk, rubbing his hands."
"“Five weeks since, I was just like yourself,” continued Rogojin,
addressing the prince, “with nothing but a bundle and the clothes I
wore."
"I ran away from my father and came to Pskoff to my aunt’s house,
where I caved in at once with fever, and he went and died while I was
away."
"All honour to my respected father’s memory--but he uncommonly
nearly killed me, all the same."
"Give you my word, prince, if I hadn’t
cut and run then, when I did, he’d have murdered me like a dog.”

“I suppose you angered him somehow?” asked the prince, looking at the
millionaire with considerable curiosity."
"But though there may have been
something remarkable in the fact that this man was heir to millions of
roubles there was something about him which surprised and interested
the prince more than that."
"Rogojin, too, seemed to have taken up the
conversation with unusual alacrity it appeared that he was still in a
considerable state of excitement, if not absolutely feverish, and was
in real need of someone to talk to for the mere sake of talking, as
safety-valve to his agitation."
"As for his red-nosed neighbour, the latter--since the information as to
the identity of Rogojin--hung over him, seemed to be living on the
honey of his words and in the breath of his nostrils, catching at every
syllable as though it were a pearl of great price."
"“Oh, yes; I angered him--I certainly did anger him,” replied Rogojin."
“But what puts me out so is my brother.
"Of course my mother couldn’t do
anything--she’s too old--and whatever brother Senka says is law for her!"
But why couldn’t he let me know?
"He sent a telegram, they say."
"What’s
the good of a telegram?"
"It frightened my aunt so that she sent it back
to the office unopened, and there it’s been ever since!"
"It’s only thanks
to Konief that I heard at all; he wrote me all about it."
"He says my
brother cut off the gold tassels from my father’s coffin, at night
‘because they’re worth a lot of money!’ says he."
"Why, I can get him
sent off to Siberia for that alone, if I like; it’s sacrilege."
"Here,
you--scarecrow!” he added, addressing the clerk at his side, “is it
sacrilege or not, by law?”

“Sacrilege, certainly--certainly sacrilege,” said the latter."
"“And it’s Siberia for sacrilege, isn’t it?”

“Undoubtedly so; Siberia, of course!”

“They will think that I’m still ill,” continued Rogojin to the prince,
“but I sloped off quietly, seedy as I was, took the train and came away."
"Aha, brother Senka, you’ll have to open your gates and let me in, my
boy!"
"I know he told tales about me to my father--I know that well enough
but I certainly did rile my father about Nastasia Philipovna that’s very
sure, and that was my own doing.”

“Nastasia Philipovna?” said the clerk, as though trying to think out
something."
"“Come, you know nothing about _her_,” said Rogojin, impatiently."
"“And supposing I do know something?” observed the other, triumphantly."
“Bosh!
there are plenty of Nastasia Philipovnas.
"And what an impertinent
beast you are!” he added angrily."
"“I thought some creature like you
would hang on to me as soon as I got hold of my money.”

“Oh, but I do know, as it happens,” said the clerk in an aggravating
manner."
“Lebedeff knows all about her.
"You are pleased to reproach me,
your excellency, but what if I prove that I am right after all?"
"Nastasia
Phillpovna’s family name is Barashkoff--I know, you see--and she is a
very well known lady, indeed, and comes of a good family, too."
"She is
connected with one Totski, Afanasy Ivanovitch, a man of considerable
property, a director of companies, and so on, and a great friend of
General Epanchin, who is interested in the same matters as he is.”

“My eyes!” said Rogojin, really surprised at last."
"“The devil take the
fellow, how does he know that?”

“Why, he knows everything--Lebedeff knows everything!"
"I was a month or
two with Lihachof after his father died, your excellency, and while he
was knocking about--he’s in the debtor’s prison now--I was with him,
and he couldn’t do a thing without Lebedeff; and I got to know Nastasia
Philipovna and several people at that time.”

“Nastasia Philipovna?"
"Why, you don’t mean to say that she and
Lihachof--” cried Rogojin, turning quite pale."
"“No, no, no, no, no!"
"Nothing of the sort, I assure you!” said Lebedeff,
hastily."
"“Oh dear no, not for the world!"
"Totski’s the only man with any
chance there."
"Oh, no!"
"He takes her to his box at the opera at the French
theatre of an evening, and the officers and people all look at her and
say, ‘By Jove, there’s the famous Nastasia Philipovna!’ but no one ever
gets any further than that, for there is nothing more to say.”

“Yes, it’s quite true,” said Rogojin, frowning gloomily; “so Zaleshoff
told me."
"I was walking about the Nefsky one fine day, prince, in my
father’s old coat, when she suddenly came out of a shop and stepped
into her carriage."
I swear I was all of a blaze at once.
"Then I met
Zaleshoff--looking like a hair-dresser’s assistant, got up as fine as I
don’t know who, while I looked like a tinker."
"‘Don’t flatter yourself,
my boy,’ said he; ‘she’s not for such as you; she’s a princess, she
is, and her name is Nastasia Philipovna Barashkoff, and she lives
with Totski, who wishes to get rid of her because he’s growing rather
old--fifty-five or so--and wants to marry a certain beauty, the
loveliest woman in all Petersburg.’ And then he told me that I could
see Nastasia Philipovna at the opera-house that evening, if I liked, and
described which was her box."
"Well, I’d like to see my father allowing
any of us to go to the theatre; he’d sooner have killed us, any day."
"However, I went for an hour or so and saw Nastasia Philipovna, and I
never slept a wink all night after."
"Next morning my father happened to
give me two government loan bonds to sell, worth nearly five thousand
roubles each."
"‘Sell them,’ said he, ‘and then take seven thousand five
hundred roubles to the office, give them to the cashier, and bring me
back the rest of the ten thousand, without looking in anywhere on the
way; look sharp, I shall be waiting for you.’ Well, I sold the bonds,
but I didn’t take the seven thousand roubles to the office; I went
straight to the English shop and chose a pair of earrings, with a
diamond the size of a nut in each."
"They cost four hundred roubles more
than I had, so I gave my name, and they trusted me."
"With the earrings
I went at once to Zaleshoff’s."
"‘Come on!’ I said, ‘come on to Nastasia
Philipovna’s,’ and off we went without more ado."
"I tell you I hadn’t a
notion of what was about me or before me or below my feet all the way;
I saw nothing whatever."
"We went straight into her drawing-room, and then
she came out to us."
"“I didn’t say right out who I was, but Zaleshoff said: ‘From Parfen
Rogojin, in memory of his first meeting with you yesterday; be so kind
as to accept these!’

“She opened the parcel, looked at the earrings, and laughed."
"“‘Thank your friend Mr. Rogojin for his kind attention,’ says she, and
bowed and went off."
Why didn’t I die there on the spot?
"The worst of it
all was, though, that the beast Zaleshoff got all the credit of it!"
"I
was short and abominably dressed, and stood and stared in her face and
never said a word, because I was shy, like an ass!"
"And there was he all
in the fashion, pomaded and dressed out, with a smart tie on, bowing and
scraping; and I bet anything she took him for me all the while!"
"“‘Look here now,’ I said, when we came out, ‘none of your interference
here after this--do you understand?’ He laughed: ‘And how are you going
to settle up with your father?’ says he."
"I thought I might as well jump
into the Neva at once without going home first; but it struck me that I
wouldn’t, after all, and I went home feeling like one of the damned.”

“My goodness!” shivered the clerk."
"“And his father,” he added, for the
prince’s instruction, “and his father would have given a man a ticket to
the other world for ten roubles any day--not to speak of ten thousand!”

The prince observed Rogojin with great curiosity; he seemed paler than
ever at this moment."
“What do you know about it?” cried the latter.
"“Well, my father learned
the whole story at once, and Zaleshoff blabbed it all over the town
besides."
"So he took me upstairs and locked me up, and swore at me for an
hour."
"‘This is only a foretaste,’ says he; ‘wait a bit till night comes,
and I’ll come back and talk to you again.’

“Well, what do you think?"
"The old fellow went straight off to Nastasia
Philipovna, touched the floor with his forehead, and began blubbering
and beseeching her on his knees to give him back the diamonds."
"So after
awhile she brought the box and flew out at him."
"‘There,’ she says,
‘take your earrings, you wretched old miser; although they are ten times
dearer than their value to me now that I know what it must have cost
Parfen to get them!"
"Give Parfen my compliments,’ she says, ‘and thank
him very much!’ Well, I meanwhile had borrowed twenty-five roubles from
a friend, and off I went to Pskoff to my aunt’s."
"The old woman there
lectured me so that I left the house and went on a drinking tour round
the public-houses of the place."
"I was in a high fever when I got to
Pskoff, and by nightfall I was lying delirious in the streets somewhere
or other!”

“Oho!"
"we’ll make Nastasia Philipovna sing another song now!” giggled
Lebedeff, rubbing his hands with glee."
"“Hey, my boy, we’ll get her some
proper earrings now!"
"We’ll get her such earrings that--”

“Look here,” cried Rogojin, seizing him fiercely by the arm, “look here,
if you so much as name Nastasia Philipovna again, I’ll tan your hide as
sure as you sit there!”

“Aha!"
do--by all means!
"if you tan my hide you won’t turn me away from
your society."
"You’ll bind me to you, with your lash, for ever."
"Ha, ha!"
"here we are at the station, though.”

Sure enough, the train was just steaming in as he spoke."
"Though Rogojin had declared that he left Pskoff secretly, a large
collection of friends had assembled to greet him, and did so with
profuse waving of hats and shouting."
"“Why, there’s Zaleshoff here, too!” he muttered, gazing at the scene
with a sort of triumphant but unpleasant smile."
"Then he suddenly turned
to the prince: “Prince, I don’t know why I have taken a fancy to you;
perhaps because I met you just when I did."
"But no, it can’t be that, for
I met this fellow” (nodding at Lebedeff) “too, and I have not taken a
fancy to him by any means."
"Come to see me, prince; we’ll take off those
gaiters of yours and dress you up in a smart fur coat, the best we
can buy."
"You shall have a dress coat, best quality, white waistcoat,
anything you like, and your pocket shall be full of money."
"Come, and
you shall go with me to Nastasia Philipovna’s."
"Now then will you come or
no?”

“Accept, accept, Prince Lef Nicolaievitch” said Lebedef solemnly; “don’t
let it slip!"
"Accept, quick!”

Prince Muishkin rose and stretched out his hand courteously, while he
replied with some cordiality:

“I will come with the greatest pleasure, and thank you very much for
taking a fancy to me."
"I dare say I may even come today if I have time,
for I tell you frankly that I like you very much too."
"I liked you
especially when you told us about the diamond earrings; but I liked you
before that as well, though you have such a dark-clouded sort of face."
"Thanks very much for the offer of clothes and a fur coat; I certainly
shall require both clothes and coat very soon."
"As for money, I have
hardly a copeck about me at this moment.”

“You shall have lots of money; by the evening I shall have plenty; so
come along!”

“That’s true enough, he’ll have lots before evening!” put in Lebedeff."
"“But, look here, are you a great hand with the ladies?"
"Let’s know that
first?” asked Rogojin."
"“Oh no, oh no!” said the prince; “I couldn’t, you know--my illness--I
hardly ever saw a soul.”

“H’m!"
"well--here, you fellow--you can come along with me now if you
like!” cried Rogojin to Lebedeff, and so they all left the carriage."
Lebedeff had his desire.
"He went off with the noisy group of Rogojin’s
friends towards the Voznesensky, while the prince’s route lay towards
the Litaynaya."
It was damp and wet.
"The prince asked his way of
passers-by, and finding that he was a couple of miles or so from his
destination, he determined to take a droshky."
II.
General Epanchin lived in his own house near the Litaynaya.
"Besides this
large residence--five-sixths of which was let in flats and lodgings--the
general was owner of another enormous house in the Sadovaya bringing in
even more rent than the first."
"Besides these houses he had a delightful
little estate just out of town, and some sort of factory in another part
of the city."
"General Epanchin, as everyone knew, had a good deal to
do with certain government monopolies; he was also a voice, and an
important one, in many rich public companies of various descriptions;
in fact, he enjoyed the reputation of being a well-to-do man of busy
habits, many ties, and affluent means."
"He had made himself indispensable
in several quarters, amongst others in his department of the government;
and yet it was a known fact that Fedor Ivanovitch Epanchin was a man of
no education whatever, and had absolutely risen from the ranks."
"This last fact could, of course, reflect nothing but credit upon the
general; and yet, though unquestionably a sagacious man, he had his own
little weaknesses--very excusable ones,--one of which was a dislike to
any allusion to the above circumstance."
He was undoubtedly clever.
"For
instance, he made a point of never asserting himself when he would
gain more by keeping in the background; and in consequence many exalted
personages valued him principally for his humility and simplicity, and
because “he knew his place.” And yet if these good people could only
have had a peep into the mind of this excellent fellow who “knew his
place” so well!"
"The fact is that, in spite of his knowledge of the world
and his really remarkable abilities, he always liked to appear to be
carrying out other people’s ideas rather than his own."
"And also, his
luck seldom failed him, even at cards, for which he had a passion that
he did not attempt to conceal."
"He played for high stakes, and moved,
altogether, in very varied society."
"As to age, General Epanchin was in the very prime of life; that is,
about fifty-five years of age,--the flowering time of existence, when
real enjoyment of life begins."
"His healthy appearance, good colour,
sound, though discoloured teeth, sturdy figure, preoccupied air during
business hours, and jolly good humour during his game at cards in the
evening, all bore witness to his success in life, and combined to make
existence a bed of roses to his excellency."
"The general was lord of a
flourishing family, consisting of his wife and three grown-up daughters."
"He had married young, while still a lieutenant, his wife being a girl of
about his own age, who possessed neither beauty nor education, and who
brought him no more than fifty souls of landed property, which
little estate served, however, as a nest-egg for far more important
accumulations."
"The general never regretted his early marriage, or
regarded it as a foolish youthful escapade; and he so respected and
feared his wife that he was very near loving her."
"Mrs. Epanchin came of
the princely stock of Muishkin, which if not a brilliant, was, at all
events, a decidedly ancient family; and she was extremely proud of her
descent."
"With a few exceptions, the worthy couple had lived through their long
union very happily."
"While still young the wife had been able to make
important friends among the aristocracy, partly by virtue of her family
descent, and partly by her own exertions; while, in after life, thanks
to their wealth and to the position of her husband in the service, she
took her place among the higher circles as by right."
"During these last few years all three of the general’s
daughters--Alexandra, Adelaida, and Aglaya--had grown up and matured."
"Of
course they were only Epanchins, but their mother’s family was noble;
they might expect considerable fortunes; their father had hopes of
attaining to very high rank indeed in his country’s service--all of which
was satisfactory."
"All three of the girls were decidedly pretty, even
the eldest, Alexandra, who was just twenty-five years old."
"The middle
daughter was now twenty-three, while the youngest, Aglaya, was twenty."
"This youngest girl was absolutely a beauty, and had begun of late to
attract considerable attention in society."
"But this was not all, for
every one of the three was clever, well educated, and accomplished."
"It was a matter of general knowledge that the three girls were very fond
of one another, and supported each other in every way; it was even said
that the two elder ones had made certain sacrifices for the sake of
the idol of the household, Aglaya."
"In society they not only disliked
asserting themselves, but were actually retiring."
"Certainly no one could
blame them for being too arrogant or haughty, and yet everybody was well
aware that they were proud and quite understood their own value."
"The
eldest was musical, while the second was a clever artist, which fact
she had concealed until lately."
"In a word, the world spoke well of the
girls; but they were not without their enemies, and occasionally people
talked with horror of the number of books they had read."
They were in no hurry to marry.
"They liked good society, but were not
too keen about it."
"All this was the more remarkable, because everyone
was well aware of the hopes and aims of their parents."
"It was about eleven o’clock in the forenoon when the prince rang the
bell at General Epanchin’s door."
"The general lived on the first floor
or flat of the house, as modest a lodging as his position permitted."
"A
liveried servant opened the door, and the prince was obliged to enter
into long explanations with this gentleman, who, from the first glance,
looked at him and his bundle with grave suspicion."
"At last, however, on
the repeated positive assurance that he really was Prince Muishkin, and
must absolutely see the general on business, the bewildered domestic
showed him into a little ante-chamber leading to a waiting-room that
adjoined the general’s study, there handing him over to another servant,
whose duty it was to be in this ante-chamber all the morning, and
announce visitors to the general."
"This second individual wore a dress
coat, and was some forty years of age; he was the general’s special
study servant, and well aware of his own importance."
"“Wait in the next room, please; and leave your bundle here,” said the
door-keeper, as he sat down comfortably in his own easy-chair in the
ante-chamber."
"He looked at the prince in severe surprise as the latter
settled himself in another chair alongside, with his bundle on his
knees."
"“If you don’t mind, I would rather sit here with you,” said the prince;
“I should prefer it to sitting in there.”

“Oh, but you can’t stay here."
"You are a visitor--a guest, so to speak."
"Is it the general himself you wish to see?”

The man evidently could not take in the idea of such a shabby-looking
visitor, and had decided to ask once more."
“Yes--I have business--” began the prince.
"“I do not ask you what your business may be, all I have to do is to
announce you; and unless the secretary comes in here I cannot do that.”

The man’s suspicions seemed to increase more and more."
"The prince was
too unlike the usual run of daily visitors; and although the general
certainly did receive, on business, all sorts and conditions of men, yet
in spite of this fact the servant felt great doubts on the subject
of this particular visitor."
"The presence of the secretary as an
intermediary was, he judged, essential in this case."
"“Surely you--are from abroad?” he inquired at last, in a confused sort
of way."
"He had begun his sentence intending to say, “Surely you are not
Prince Muishkin, are you?”

“Yes, straight from the train!"
"Did not you intend to say, ‘Surely you
are not Prince Muishkin?’ just now, but refrained out of politeness?”

“H’m!” grunted the astonished servant."
"“I assure you I am not deceiving you; you shall not have to answer for
me."
"As to my being dressed like this, and carrying a bundle, there’s
nothing surprising in that--the fact is, my circumstances are not
particularly rosy at this moment.”

“H’m!--no, I’m not afraid of that, you see; I have to announce you,
that’s all."
"The secretary will be out directly--that is, unless you--yes,
that’s the rub--unless you--come, you must allow me to ask you--you’ve
not come to beg, have you?”

“Oh dear no, you can be perfectly easy on that score."
"I have quite
another matter on hand.”

“You must excuse my asking, you know."
"Your appearance led me to
think--but just wait for the secretary; the general is busy now, but the
secretary is sure to come out.”

“Oh--well, look here, if I have some time to wait, would you mind
telling me, is there any place about where I could have a smoke?"
"I have
my pipe and tobacco with me.”

“_Smoke?_” said the man, in shocked but disdainful surprise, blinking his
eyes at the prince as though he could not believe his senses."
"“No, sir,
you cannot smoke here, and I wonder you are not ashamed of the very
suggestion."
"Ha, ha!"
"a cool idea that, I declare!”

“Oh, I didn’t mean in this room!"
"I know I can’t smoke here, of course."
"I’d adjourn to some other room, wherever you like to show me to."
"You
see, I’m used to smoking a good deal, and now I haven’t had a puff for
three hours; however, just as you like.”

“Now how on earth am I to announce a man like that?” muttered the
servant."
"“In the first place, you’ve no right in here at all; you ought
to be in the waiting-room, because you’re a sort of visitor--a guest, in
fact--and I shall catch it for this."
"Look here, do you intend to take up
you abode with us?” he added, glancing once more at the prince’s bundle,
which evidently gave him no peace."
"“No, I don’t think so."
"I don’t think I should stay even if they were
to invite me."
"I’ve simply come to make their acquaintance, and nothing
more.”

“Make their acquaintance?” asked the man, in amazement, and with
redoubled suspicion."
"“Then why did you say you had business with the
general?”

“Oh well, very little business."
"There is one little matter--some
advice I am going to ask him for; but my principal object is simply to
introduce myself, because I am Prince Muishkin, and Madame Epanchin is
the last of her branch of the house, and besides herself and me there
are no other Muishkins left.”

“What--you’re a relation then, are you?” asked the servant, so
bewildered that he began to feel quite alarmed."
"“Well, hardly so."
"If you stretch a point, we are relations, of course,
but so distant that one cannot really take cognizance of it."
"I once
wrote to your mistress from abroad, but she did not reply."
"However, I
have thought it right to make acquaintance with her on my arrival."
"I am
telling you all this in order to ease your mind, for I see you are still
far from comfortable on my account."
"All you have to do is to announce me
as Prince Muishkin, and the object of my visit will be plain enough."
"If
I am received--very good; if not, well, very good again."
"But they are
sure to receive me, I should think; Madame Epanchin will naturally be
curious to see the only remaining representative of her family."
"She
values her Muishkin descent very highly, if I am rightly informed.”

The prince’s conversation was artless and confiding to a degree, and
the servant could not help feeling that as from visitor to common
serving-man this state of things was highly improper."
"His conclusion was
that one of two things must be the explanation--either that this was a
begging impostor, or that the prince, if prince he were, was simply a
fool, without the slightest ambition; for a sensible prince with any
ambition would certainly not wait about in ante-rooms with servants, and
talk of his own private affairs like this."
"In either case, how was he to
announce this singular visitor?"
"“I really think I must request you to step into the next room!” he said,
with all the insistence he could muster."
“Why?
"If I had been sitting there now, I should not have had the
opportunity of making these personal explanations."
"I see you are still
uneasy about me and keep eyeing my cloak and bundle."
"Don’t you think
you might go in yourself now, without waiting for the secretary to come
out?”

“No, no!"
I can’t announce a visitor like yourself without the secretary.
"Besides the general said he was not to be disturbed--he is with the
Colonel C--."
"Gavrila Ardalionovitch goes in without announcing.”

“Who may that be?"
"a clerk?”

“What?"
Gavrila Ardalionovitch?
"Oh no; he belongs to one of the
companies."
"Look here, at all events put your bundle down, here.”

“Yes, I will if I may; and--can I take off my cloak”

“Of course; you can’t go in _there_ with it on, anyhow.”

The prince rose and took off his mantle, revealing a neat enough morning
costume--a little worn, but well made."
"He wore a steel watch chain and
from this chain there hung a silver Geneva watch."
"Fool the prince might
be, still, the general’s servant felt that it was not correct for him to
continue to converse thus with a visitor, in spite of the fact that the
prince pleased him somehow."
"“And what time of day does the lady receive?” the latter asked,
reseating himself in his old place."
"“Oh, that’s not in _my_ province!"
"I believe she receives at any time; it
depends upon the visitors."
The dressmaker goes in at eleven.
"Gavrila
Ardalionovitch is allowed much earlier than other people, too; he is
even admitted to early lunch now and then.”

“It is much warmer in the rooms here than it is abroad at this season,”
 observed the prince; “but it is much warmer there out of doors."
"As for
the houses--a Russian can’t live in them in the winter until he gets
accustomed to them.”

“Don’t they heat them at all?”

“Well, they do heat them a little; but the houses and stoves are so
different to ours.”

“H’m!"
"were you long away?”

“Four years!"
"and I was in the same place nearly all the time,--in one
village.”

“You must have forgotten Russia, hadn’t you?”

“Yes, indeed I had--a good deal; and, would you believe it, I often
wonder at myself for not having forgotten how to speak Russian?"
"Even
now, as I talk to you, I keep saying to myself ‘how well I am speaking
it.’ Perhaps that is partly why I am so talkative this morning."
"I assure
you, ever since yesterday evening I have had the strongest desire to go
on and on talking Russian.”

“H’m!"
"yes; did you live in Petersburg in former years?”

This good flunkey, in spite of his conscientious scruples, really could
not resist continuing such a very genteel and agreeable conversation."
“In Petersburg?
Oh no!
"hardly at all, and now they say so much is
changed in the place that even those who did know it well are obliged to
relearn what they knew."
"They talk a good deal about the new law courts,
and changes there, don’t they?”

“H’m!"
"yes, that’s true enough."
"Well now, how is the law over there, do
they administer it more justly than here?”

“Oh, I don’t know about that!"
"I’ve heard much that is good about our
legal administration, too."
"There is no capital punishment here for one
thing.”

“Is there over there?”

“Yes--I saw an execution in France--at Lyons."
"Schneider took me over
with him to see it.”

“What, did they hang the fellow?”

“No, they cut off people’s heads in France.”

“What did the fellow do?--yell?”

“Oh no--it’s the work of an instant."
"They put a man inside a frame and
a sort of broad knife falls by machinery--they call the thing a
guillotine--it falls with fearful force and weight--the head springs
off so quickly that you can’t wink your eye in between."
"But all the
preparations are so dreadful."
"When they announce the sentence, you know,
and prepare the criminal and tie his hands, and cart him off to the
scaffold--that’s the fearful part of the business."
"The people all crowd
round--even women--though they don’t at all approve of women looking on.”

“No, it’s not a thing for women.”

“Of course not--of course not!--bah!"
"The criminal was a fine intelligent
fearless man; Le Gros was his name; and I may tell you--believe it or
not, as you like--that when that man stepped upon the scaffold he _cried_,
he did indeed,--he was as white as a bit of paper."
"Isn’t it a dreadful
idea that he should have cried--cried!"
"Whoever heard of a grown man
crying from fear--not a child, but a man who never had cried before--a
grown man of forty-five years."
"Imagine what must have been going on in
that man’s mind at such a moment; what dreadful convulsions his whole
spirit must have endured; it is an outrage on the soul that’s what it
is."
"Because it is said ‘thou shalt not kill,’ is he to be killed because
he murdered some one else?"
"No, it is not right, it’s an impossible
theory."
"I assure you, I saw the sight a month ago and it’s dancing
before my eyes to this moment."
"I dream of it, often.”

The prince had grown animated as he spoke, and a tinge of colour
suffused his pale face, though his way of talking was as quiet as ever."
The servant followed his words with sympathetic interest.
"Clearly he
was not at all anxious to bring the conversation to an end."
Who knows?
"Perhaps he too was a man of imagination and with some capacity for
thought."
"“Well, at all events it is a good thing that there’s no pain when the
poor fellow’s head flies off,” he remarked."
"“Do you know, though,” cried the prince warmly, “you made that remark
now, and everyone says the same thing, and the machine is designed with
the purpose of avoiding pain, this guillotine I mean; but a thought came
into my head then: what if it be a bad plan after all?"
"You may laugh at
my idea, perhaps--but I could not help its occurring to me all the same."
"Now with the rack and tortures and so on--you suffer terrible pain of
course; but then your torture is bodily pain only (although no doubt you
have plenty of that) until you die."
"But _here_ I should imagine the
most terrible part of the whole punishment is, not the bodily pain at
all--but the certain knowledge that in an hour,--then in ten minutes,
then in half a minute, then now--this very _instant_--your soul must
quit your body and that you will no longer be a man--and that this
is certain, _certain_!"
That’s the point--the certainty of it.
"Just that
instant when you place your head on the block and hear the iron grate
over your head--then--that quarter of a second is the most awful of all."
"“This is not my own fantastical opinion--many people have thought the
same; but I feel it so deeply that I’ll tell you what I think."
"I believe
that to execute a man for murder is to punish him immeasurably more
dreadfully than is equivalent to his crime."
"A murder by sentence is
far more dreadful than a murder committed by a criminal."
"The man who is
attacked by robbers at night, in a dark wood, or anywhere, undoubtedly
hopes and hopes that he may yet escape until the very moment of his
death."
"There are plenty of instances of a man running away, or imploring
for mercy--at all events hoping on in some degree--even after his throat
was cut."
"But in the case of an execution, that last hope--having which
it is so immeasurably less dreadful to die,--is taken away from the
wretch and _certainty_ substituted in its place!"
"There is his sentence,
and with it that terrible certainty that he cannot possibly escape
death--which, I consider, must be the most dreadful anguish in the
world."
"You may place a soldier before a cannon’s mouth in battle, and
fire upon him--and he will still hope."
"But read to that same soldier his
death-sentence, and he will either go mad or burst into tears."
"Who dares
to say that any man can suffer this without going mad?"
"No, no!"
"it is
an abuse, a shame, it is unnecessary--why should such a thing exist?"
"Doubtless there may be men who have been sentenced, who have suffered
this mental anguish for a while and then have been reprieved; perhaps
such men may have been able to relate their feelings afterwards."
"Our
Lord Christ spoke of this anguish and dread."
No!
no!
no!
"No man should
be treated so, no man, no man!”

The servant, though of course he could not have expressed all this
as the prince did, still clearly entered into it and was greatly
conciliated, as was evident from the increased amiability of his
expression."
"“If you are really very anxious for a smoke,” he remarked,
“I think it might possibly be managed, if you are very quick about it."
"You see they might come out and inquire for you, and you wouldn’t be on
the spot."
You see that door there?
"Go in there and you’ll find a little
room on the right; you can smoke there, only open the window, because I
ought not to allow it really, and--.” But there was no time, after all."
"A young fellow entered the ante-room at this moment, with a bundle
of papers in his hand."
"The footman hastened to help him take off his
overcoat."
"The new arrival glanced at the prince out of the corners of
his eyes."
"“This gentleman declares, Gavrila Ardalionovitch,” began the man,
confidentially and almost familiarly, “that he is Prince Muishkin and
a relative of Madame Epanchin’s."
"He has just arrived from abroad, with
nothing but a bundle by way of luggage--.”

The prince did not hear the rest, because at this point the servant
continued his communication in a whisper."
"Gavrila Ardalionovitch listened attentively, and gazed at the prince
with great curiosity."
"At last he motioned the man aside and stepped
hurriedly towards the prince."
"“Are you Prince Muishkin?” he asked, with the greatest courtesy and
amiability."
"He was a remarkably handsome young fellow of some twenty-eight summers,
fair and of middle height; he wore a small beard, and his face was most
intelligent."
"Yet his smile, in spite of its sweetness, was a little
thin, if I may so call it, and showed his teeth too evenly; his
gaze though decidedly good-humoured and ingenuous, was a trifle too
inquisitive and intent to be altogether agreeable."
"“Probably when he is alone he looks quite different, and hardly smiles
at all!” thought the prince."
"He explained about himself in a few words, very much the same as he had
told the footman and Rogojin beforehand."
"Gavrila Ardalionovitch meanwhile seemed to be trying to recall
something."
"“Was it not you, then, who sent a letter a year or less ago--from
Switzerland, I think it was--to Elizabetha Prokofievna (Mrs. Epanchin)?”

“It was.”

“Oh, then, of course they will remember who you are."
"You wish to see
the general?"
"I’ll tell him at once--he will be free in a minute; but
you--you had better wait in the ante-chamber,--hadn’t you?"
"Why is he
here?” he added, severely, to the man."
"“I tell you, sir, he wished it himself!”

At this moment the study door opened, and a military man, with a
portfolio under his arm, came out talking loudly, and after bidding
good-bye to someone inside, took his departure."
"“You there, Gania?” cried a voice from the study, “come in here, will
you?”

Gavrila Ardalionovitch nodded to the prince and entered the room
hastily."
"A couple of minutes later the door opened again and the affable voice of
Gania cried:

“Come in please, prince!”

III."
"General Ivan Fedorovitch Epanchin was standing in the middle of the
room, and gazed with great curiosity at the prince as he entered."
"He
even advanced a couple of steps to meet him."
The prince came forward and introduced himself.
"“Quite so,” replied the general, “and what can I do for you?”

“Oh, I have no special business; my principal object was to make your
acquaintance."
I should not like to disturb you.
"I do not know your times
and arrangements here, you see, but I have only just arrived."
"I came
straight from the station."
"I am come direct from Switzerland.”

The general very nearly smiled, but thought better of it and kept his
smile back."
"Then he reflected, blinked his eyes, stared at his guest
once more from head to foot; then abruptly motioned him to a chair, sat
down himself, and waited with some impatience for the prince to speak."
"Gania stood at his table in the far corner of the room, turning over
papers."
"“I have not much time for making acquaintances, as a rule,” said the
general, “but as, of course, you have your object in coming, I--”

“I felt sure you would think I had some object in view when I resolved
to pay you this visit,” the prince interrupted; “but I give you my word,
beyond the pleasure of making your acquaintance I had no personal object
whatever.”

“The pleasure is, of course, mutual; but life is not all pleasure, as
you are aware."
"There is such a thing as business, and I really do not
see what possible reason there can be, or what we have in common to--”

“Oh, there is no reason, of course, and I suppose there is nothing in
common between us, or very little; for if I am Prince Muishkin, and your
wife happens to be a member of my house, that can hardly be called a
‘reason.’ I quite understand that."
"And yet that was my whole motive for
coming."
"You see I have not been in Russia for four years, and knew very
little about anything when I left."
"I had been very ill for a long time,
and I feel now the need of a few good friends."
"In fact, I have a certain
question upon which I much need advice, and do not know whom to go to
for it."
I thought of your family when I was passing through Berlin.
"‘They are almost relations,’ I said to myself, ‘so I’ll begin with them;
perhaps we may get on with each other, I with them and they with me, if
they are kind people;’ and I have heard that you are very kind people!”

“Oh, thank you, thank you, I’m sure,” replied the general, considerably
taken aback."
"“May I ask where you have taken up your quarters?”

“Nowhere, as yet.”

“What, straight from the station to my house?"
"And how about your
luggage?”

“I only had a small bundle, containing linen, with me, nothing more."
"I
can carry it in my hand, easily."
"There will be plenty of time to take a
room in some hotel by the evening.”

“Oh, then you _do_ intend to take a room?”

“Of course.”

“To judge from your words, you came straight to my house with the
intention of staying there.”

“That could only have been on your invitation."
"I confess, however, that
I should not have stayed here even if you had invited me, not for any
particular reason, but because it is--well, contrary to my practice and
nature, somehow.”

“Oh, indeed!"
"Then it is perhaps as well that I neither _did_ invite you,
nor _do_ invite you now."
"Excuse me, prince, but we had better make this
matter clear, once for all."
"We have just agreed that with regard to our
relationship there is not much to be said, though, of course, it would
have been very delightful to us to feel that such relationship did
actually exist; therefore, perhaps--”

“Therefore, perhaps I had better get up and go away?” said the prince,
laughing merrily as he rose from his place; just as merrily as though
the circumstances were by no means strained or difficult."
"“And I give
you my word, general, that though I know nothing whatever of manners and
customs of society, and how people live and all that, yet I felt quite
sure that this visit of mine would end exactly as it has ended now."
"Oh, well, I suppose it’s all right; especially as my letter was not
answered."
"Well, good-bye, and forgive me for having disturbed you!”

The prince’s expression was so good-natured at this moment, and so
entirely free from even a suspicion of unpleasant feeling was the
smile with which he looked at the general as he spoke, that the latter
suddenly paused, and appeared to gaze at his guest from quite a new
point of view, all in an instant."
"“Do you know, prince,” he said, in quite a different tone, “I do not
know you at all, yet, and after all, Elizabetha Prokofievna would
very likely be pleased to have a peep at a man of her own name."
"Wait a
little, if you don’t mind, and if you have time to spare?”

“Oh, I assure you I’ve lots of time, my time is entirely my own!” And
the prince immediately replaced his soft, round hat on the table."
"“I
confess, I thought Elizabetha Prokofievna would very likely remember
that I had written her a letter."
"Just now your servant--outside
there--was dreadfully suspicious that I had come to beg of you."
"I
noticed that!"
"Probably he has very strict instructions on that score;
but I assure you I did not come to beg."
I came to make some friends.
"But I am rather bothered at having disturbed you; that’s all I care
about.--”

“Look here, prince,” said the general, with a cordial smile, “if you
really are the sort of man you appear to be, it may be a source of great
pleasure to us to make your better acquaintance; but, you see, I am
a very busy man, and have to be perpetually sitting here and signing
papers, or off to see his excellency, or to my department, or somewhere;
so that though I should be glad to see more of people, nice people--you
see, I--however, I am sure you are so well brought up that you will see
at once, and--but how old are you, prince?”

“Twenty-six.”

“No?"
"I thought you very much younger.”

“Yes, they say I have a ‘young’ face."
"As to disturbing you I shall soon
learn to avoid doing that, for I hate disturbing people."
"Besides, you
and I are so differently constituted, I should think, that there must be
very little in common between us."
"Not that I will ever believe there is
_nothing_ in common between any two people, as some declare is the case."
"I am sure people make a great mistake in sorting each other into groups,
by appearances; but I am boring you, I see, you--”

“Just two words: have you any means at all?"
"Or perhaps you may be
intending to undertake some sort of employment?"
"Excuse my questioning
you, but--”

“Oh, my dear sir, I esteem and understand your kindness in putting the
question."
"No; at present I have no means whatever, and no employment
either, but I hope to find some."
I was living on other people abroad.
"Schneider, the professor who treated me and taught me, too, in
Switzerland, gave me just enough money for my journey, so that now I
have but a few copecks left."
"There certainly is one question upon which
I am anxious to have advice, but--”

“Tell me, how do you intend to live now, and what are your plans?”
 interrupted the general."
"“I wish to work, somehow or other.”

“Oh yes, but then, you see, you are a philosopher."
"Have you any talents,
or ability in any direction--that is, any that would bring in money and
bread?"
"Excuse me again--”

“Oh, don’t apologize."
"No, I don’t think I have either talents or special
abilities of any kind; on the contrary."
"I have always been an invalid
and unable to learn much."
"As for bread, I should think--”

The general interrupted once more with questions; while the prince again
replied with the narrative we have heard before."
"It appeared that the
general had known Pavlicheff; but why the latter had taken an interest
in the prince, that young gentleman could not explain; probably by
virtue of the old friendship with his father, he thought."
"The prince had been left an orphan when quite a little child, and
Pavlicheff had entrusted him to an old lady, a relative of his own,
living in the country, the child needing the fresh air and exercise of
country life."
"He was educated, first by a governess, and afterwards by a
tutor, but could not remember much about this time of his life."
"His fits
were so frequent then, that they made almost an idiot of him (the prince
used the expression “idiot” himself)."
"Pavlicheff had met Professor
Schneider in Berlin, and the latter had persuaded him to send the boy
to Switzerland, to Schneider’s establishment there, for the cure of his
epilepsy, and, five years before this time, the prince was sent off."
"But
Pavlicheff had died two or three years since, and Schneider had himself
supported the young fellow, from that day to this, at his own expense."
"Although he had not quite cured him, he had greatly improved his
condition; and now, at last, at the prince’s own desire, and because
of a certain matter which came to the ears of the latter, Schneider had
despatched the young man to Russia."
The general was much astonished.
"“Then you have no one, absolutely _no_ one in Russia?” he asked."
"“No one, at present; but I hope to make friends; and then I have a
letter from--”

“At all events,” put in the general, not listening to the news about the
letter, “at all events, you must have learned _something_, and your
malady would not prevent your undertaking some easy work, in one of the
departments, for instance?”

“Oh dear no, oh no!"
"As for a situation, I should much like to find one
for I am anxious to discover what I really am fit for."
"I have learned
a good deal in the last four years, and, besides, I read a great many
Russian books.”

“Russian books, indeed?"
"Then, of course, you can read and write quite
correctly?”

“Oh dear, yes!”

“Capital!"
"And your handwriting?”

“Ah, there I am _really_ talented!"
I may say I am a real caligraphist.
"Let
me write you something, just to show you,” said the prince, with some
excitement."
“With pleasure!
"In fact, it is very necessary."
"I like your readiness,
prince; in fact, I must say--I--I--like you very well, altogether,” said
the general."
"“What delightful writing materials you have here, such a lot of pencils
and things, and what beautiful paper!"
It’s a charming room altogether.
"I know that picture, it’s a Swiss view."
"I’m sure the artist painted it
from nature, and that I have seen the very place--”

“Quite likely, though I bought it here."
"Gania, give the prince some
paper."
"Here are pens and paper; now then, take this table."
"What’s
this?” the general continued to Gania, who had that moment taken a large
photograph out of his portfolio, and shown it to his senior."
“Halloa!
Nastasia Philipovna!
Did she send it you herself?
"Herself?” he inquired,
with much curiosity and great animation."
"“She gave it me just now, when I called in to congratulate her."
"I asked
her for it long ago."
"I don’t know whether she meant it for a hint that
I had come empty-handed, without a present for her birthday, or what,”
 added Gania, with an unpleasant smile."
"“Oh, nonsense, nonsense,” said the general, with decision."
"“What
extraordinary ideas you have, Gania!"
"As if she would hint; that’s
not her way at all."
"Besides, what could _you_ give her, without having
thousands at your disposal?"
"You might have given her your portrait,
however."
"Has she ever asked you for it?”

“No, not yet."
Very likely she never will.
"I suppose you haven’t
forgotten about tonight, have you, Ivan Fedorovitch?"
"You were one of
those specially invited, you know.”

“Oh no, I remember all right, and I shall go, of course."
"I should think
so!"
She’s twenty-five years old today!
"And, you know, Gania, you must
be ready for great things; she has promised both myself and Afanasy
Ivanovitch that she will give a decided answer tonight, yes or no."
"So be
prepared!”

Gania suddenly became so ill at ease that his face grew paler than ever."
"“Are you sure she said that?” he asked, and his voice seemed to quiver
as he spoke."
"“Yes, she promised."
"We both worried her so that she gave in; but she
wished us to tell you nothing about it until the day.”

The general watched Gania’s confusion intently, and clearly did not like
it."
"“Remember, Ivan Fedorovitch,” said Gania, in great agitation, “that I
was to be free too, until her decision; and that even then I was to have
my ‘yes or no’ free.”

“Why, don’t you, aren’t you--” began the general, in alarm."
"“Oh, don’t misunderstand--”

“But, my dear fellow, what are you doing, what do you mean?”

“Oh, I’m not rejecting her."
"I may have expressed myself badly, but I
didn’t mean that.”

“Reject her!"
"I should think not!” said the general with annoyance, and
apparently not in the least anxious to conceal it."
"“Why, my dear
fellow, it’s not a question of your rejecting her, it is whether you are
prepared to receive her consent joyfully, and with proper satisfaction."
"How are things going on at home?”

“At home?"
"Oh, I can do as I like there, of course; only my father will
make a fool of himself, as usual."
"He is rapidly becoming a general
nuisance."
"I don’t ever talk to him now, but I hold him in check, safe
enough."
"I swear if it had not been for my mother, I should have shown
him the way out, long ago."
"My mother is always crying, of course, and my
sister sulks."
"I had to tell them at last that I intended to be master of
my own destiny, and that I expect to be obeyed at home."
"At least, I gave
my sister to understand as much, and my mother was present.”

“Well, I must say, I cannot understand it!” said the general, shrugging
his shoulders and dropping his hands."
"“You remember your mother, Nina
Alexandrovna, that day she came and sat here and groaned--and when I
asked her what was the matter, she says, ‘Oh, it’s such a _dishonour_
to us!’ dishonour!"
Stuff and nonsense!
"I should like to know who can
reproach Nastasia Philipovna, or who can say a word of any kind against
her."
Did she mean because Nastasia had been living with Totski?
"What
nonsense it is!"
"You would not let her come near your daughters, says
Nina Alexandrovna."
"What next, I wonder?"
"I don’t see how she can fail
to--to understand--”

“Her own position?” prompted Gania."
“She does understand.
"Don’t be
annoyed with her."
"I have warned her not to meddle in other people’s
affairs."
"However, although there’s comparative peace at home at present,
the storm will break if anything is finally settled tonight.”

The prince heard the whole of the foregoing conversation, as he sat at
the table, writing."
"He finished at last, and brought the result of his
labour to the general’s desk."
"“So this is Nastasia Philipovna,” he said, looking attentively and
curiously at the portrait."
"“How wonderfully beautiful!” he immediately
added, with warmth."
"The picture was certainly that of an unusually
lovely woman."
"She was photographed in a black silk dress of simple
design, her hair was evidently dark and plainly arranged, her eyes were
deep and thoughtful, the expression of her face passionate, but proud."
"She was rather thin, perhaps, and a little pale."
"Both Gania and the
general gazed at the prince in amazement."
"“How do you know it’s Nastasia Philipovna?” asked the general; “you
surely don’t know her already, do you?”

“Yes, I do!"
"I have only been one day in Russia, but I have heard of
the great beauty!” And the prince proceeded to narrate his meeting with
Rogojin in the train and the whole of the latter’s story."
"“There’s news!” said the general in some excitement, after listening to
the story with engrossed attention."
"“Oh, of course it’s nothing but humbug!” cried Gania, a little
disturbed, however."
"“It’s all humbug; the young merchant was pleased
to indulge in a little innocent recreation!"
"I have heard something of
Rogojin!”

“Yes, so have I!” replied the general."
"“Nastasia Philipovna told us
all about the earrings that very day."
"But now it is quite a different
matter."
"You see the fellow really has a million of roubles, and he is
passionately in love."
"The whole story smells of passion, and we all
know what this class of gentry is capable of when infatuated."
"I am much
afraid of some disagreeable scandal, I am indeed!”

“You are afraid of the million, I suppose,” said Gania, grinning and
showing his teeth."
"“And you are _not_, I presume, eh?”

“How did he strike you, prince?” asked Gania, suddenly."
"“Did he seem to
be a serious sort of a man, or just a common rowdy fellow?"
"What was your
own opinion about the matter?”

While Gania put this question, a new idea suddenly flashed into his
brain, and blazed out, impatiently, in his eyes."
"The general, who was
really agitated and disturbed, looked at the prince too, but did not
seem to expect much from his reply."
"“I really don’t quite know how to tell you,” replied the prince, “but
it certainly did seem to me that the man was full of passion, and not,
perhaps, quite healthy passion."
He seemed to be still far from well.
"Very likely he will be in bed again in a day or two, especially if he
lives fast.”

“No!"
"do you think so?” said the general, catching at the idea."
"“Yes, I do think so!”

“Yes, but the sort of scandal I referred to may happen at any moment."
"It
may be this very evening,” remarked Gania to the general, with a smile."
“Of course; quite so.
"In that case it all depends upon what is going on
in her brain at this moment.”

“You know the kind of person she is at times.”

“How?"
"What kind of person is she?” cried the general, arrived at the
limits of his patience."
"“Look here, Gania, don’t you go annoying her
tonight."
"What you are to do is to be as agreeable towards her as ever you
can."
"Well, what are you smiling at?"
"You must understand, Gania, that
I have no interest whatever in speaking like this."
"Whichever way the
question is settled, it will be to my advantage."
"Nothing will move
Totski from his resolution, so I run no risk."
"If there is anything I
desire, you must know that it is your benefit only."
Can’t you trust me?
"You are a sensible fellow, and I have been counting on you; for, in this
matter, that, that--”

“Yes, that’s the chief thing,” said Gania, helping the general out of
his difficulties again, and curling his lips in an envenomed smile,
which he did not attempt to conceal."
"He gazed with his fevered eyes
straight into those of the general, as though he were anxious that the
latter might read his thoughts."
The general grew purple with anger.
"“Yes, of course it is the chief thing!” he cried, looking sharply at
Gania."
"“What a very curious man you are, Gania!"
"You actually seem to
be _glad_ to hear of this millionaire fellow’s arrival--just as though you
wished for an excuse to get out of the whole thing."
"This is an affair in
which you ought to act honestly with both sides, and give due warning,
to avoid compromising others."
"But, even now, there is still time."
"Do
you understand me?"
"I wish to know whether you desire this arrangement or
whether you do not?"
"If not, say so,--and--and welcome!"
"No one is trying
to force you into the snare, Gavrila Ardalionovitch, if you see a snare
in the matter, at least.”

“I do desire it,” murmured Gania, softly but firmly, lowering his eyes;
and he relapsed into gloomy silence."
The general was satisfied.
"He had excited himself, and was evidently
now regretting that he had gone so far."
"He turned to the prince, and
suddenly the disagreeable thought of the latter’s presence struck
him, and the certainty that he must have heard every word of the
conversation."
"But he felt at ease in another moment; it only needed one
glance at the prince to see that in that quarter there was nothing to
fear."
"“Oh!” cried the general, catching sight of the prince’s specimen of
caligraphy, which the latter had now handed him for inspection."
"“Why,
this is simply beautiful; look at that, Gania, there’s real talent
there!”

On a sheet of thick writing-paper the prince had written in medieval
characters the legend:

“The gentle Abbot Pafnute signed this.”

“There,” explained the prince, with great delight and animation, “there,
that’s the abbot’s real signature--from a manuscript of the fourteenth
century."
"All these old abbots and bishops used to write most
beautifully, with such taste and so much care and diligence."
"Have you no
copy of Pogodin, general?"
If you had one I could show you another type.
"Stop a bit--here you have the large round writing common in France
during the eighteenth century."
"Some of the letters are shaped quite
differently from those now in use."
"It was the writing current then, and
employed by public writers generally."
"I copied this from one of them,
and you can see how good it is."
"Look at the well-rounded a and d. I
have tried to translate the French character into the Russian letters--a
difficult thing to do, but I think I have succeeded fairly."
"Here is a
fine sentence, written in a good, original hand--‘Zeal triumphs over
all.’ That is the script of the Russian War Office."
"That is how official
documents addressed to important personages should be written."
"The
letters are round, the type black, and the style somewhat remarkable."
"A
stylist would not allow these ornaments, or attempts at flourishes--just
look at these unfinished tails!--but it has distinction and really
depicts the soul of the writer."
"He would like to give play to his
imagination, and follow the inspiration of his genius, but a soldier is
only at ease in the guard-room, and the pen stops half-way, a slave
to discipline."
How delightful!
"The first time I met an example of this
handwriting, I was positively astonished, and where do you think I
chanced to find it?"
"In Switzerland, of all places!"
"Now that is an
ordinary English hand."
"It can hardly be improved, it is so refined and
exquisite--almost perfection."
"This is an example of another kind,
a mixture of styles."
"The copy was given me by a French commercial
traveller."
"It is founded on the English, but the downstrokes are a
little blacker, and more marked."
"Notice that the oval has some slight
modification--it is more rounded."
"This writing allows for flourishes;
now a flourish is a dangerous thing!"
"Its use requires such taste, but,
if successful, what a distinction it gives to the whole!"
"It results in
an incomparable type--one to fall in love with!”

“Dear me!"
"How you have gone into all the refinements and details of the
question!"
"Why, my dear fellow, you are not a caligraphist, you are an
artist!"
"Eh, Gania?”

“Wonderful!” said Gania."
"“And he knows it too,” he added, with a
sarcastic smile."
"“You may smile,--but there’s a career in this,” said the general."
"“You
don’t know what a great personage I shall show this to, prince."
"Why, you
can command a situation at thirty-five roubles per month to start with."
"However, it’s half-past twelve,” he concluded, looking at his watch; “so
to business, prince, for I must be setting to work and shall not see you
again today."
Sit down a minute.
"I have told you that I cannot receive
you myself very often, but I should like to be of some assistance to
you, some small assistance, of a kind that would give you satisfaction."
"I shall find you a place in one of the State departments, an easy
place--but you will require to be accurate."
"Now, as to your plans--in
the house, or rather in the family of Gania here--my young friend, whom
I hope you will know better--his mother and sister have prepared two
or three rooms for lodgers, and let them to highly recommended young
fellows, with board and attendance."
"I am sure Nina Alexandrovna will
take you in on my recommendation."
"There you will be comfortable and well
taken care of; for I do not think, prince, that you are the sort of
man to be left to the mercy of Fate in a town like Petersburg."
"Nina
Alexandrovna, Gania’s mother, and Varvara Alexandrovna, are ladies for
whom I have the highest possible esteem and respect."
"Nina Alexandrovna
is the wife of General Ardalion Alexandrovitch, my old brother in arms,
with whom, I regret to say, on account of certain circumstances, I am no
longer acquainted."
"I give you all this information, prince, in order
to make it clear to you that I am personally recommending you to this
family, and that in so doing, I am more or less taking upon myself to
answer for you."
"The terms are most reasonable, and I trust that your
salary will very shortly prove amply sufficient for your expenditure."
"Of
course pocket-money is a necessity, if only a little; do not be angry,
prince, if I strongly recommend you to avoid carrying money in your
pocket."
"But as your purse is quite empty at the present moment, you must
allow me to press these twenty-five roubles upon your acceptance, as
something to begin with."
"Of course we will settle this little matter
another time, and if you are the upright, honest man you look, I
anticipate very little trouble between us on that score."
"Taking so much
interest in you as you may perceive I do, I am not without my object,
and you shall know it in good time."
"You see, I am perfectly candid with
you."
"I hope, Gania, you have nothing to say against the prince’s taking
up his abode in your house?”

“Oh, on the contrary!"
"my mother will be very glad,” said Gania,
courteously and kindly."
"“I think only one of your rooms is engaged as yet, is it not?"
"That
fellow Ferd-Ferd--”

“Ferdishenko.”

“Yes--I don’t like that Ferdishenko."
"I can’t understand why Nastasia
Philipovna encourages him so."
"Is he really her cousin, as he says?”

“Oh dear no, it’s all a joke."
"No more cousin than I am.”

“Well, what do you think of the arrangement, prince?”

“Thank you, general; you have behaved very kindly to me; all the more
so since I did not ask you to help me."
I don’t say that out of pride.
"I
certainly did not know where to lay my head tonight."
"Rogojin asked me to
come to his house, of course, but--”

“Rogojin?"
"No, no, my good fellow."
"I should strongly recommend you,
paternally,--or, if you prefer it, as a friend,--to forget all about
Rogojin, and, in fact, to stick to the family into which you are about
to enter.”

“Thank you,” began the prince; “and since you are so very kind there is
just one matter which I--”

“You must really excuse me,” interrupted the general, “but I positively
haven’t another moment now."
"I shall just tell Elizabetha Prokofievna
about you, and if she wishes to receive you at once--as I shall advise
her--I strongly recommend you to ingratiate yourself with her at the
first opportunity, for my wife may be of the greatest service to you in
many ways."
"If she cannot receive you now, you must be content to wait
till another time."
"Meanwhile you, Gania, just look over these accounts,
will you?"
"We mustn’t forget to finish off that matter--”

The general left the room, and the prince never succeeded in broaching
the business which he had on hand, though he had endeavoured to do so
four times."
Gania lit a cigarette and offered one to the prince.
"The latter accepted
the offer, but did not talk, being unwilling to disturb Gania’s work."
He commenced to examine the study and its contents.
"But Gania hardly
so much as glanced at the papers lying before him; he was absent and
thoughtful, and his smile and general appearance struck the prince still
more disagreeably now that the two were left alone together."
"Suddenly Gania approached our hero who was at the moment standing over
Nastasia Philipovna’s portrait, gazing at it."
"“Do you admire that sort of woman, prince?” he asked, looking intently
at him."
He seemed to have some special object in the question.
"“It’s a wonderful face,” said the prince, “and I feel sure that her
destiny is not by any means an ordinary, uneventful one."
"Her face is
smiling enough, but she must have suffered terribly--hasn’t she?"
"Her
eyes show it--those two bones there, the little points under her eyes,
just where the cheek begins."
"It’s a proud face too, terribly proud!"
"And
I--I can’t say whether she is good and kind, or not."
"Oh, if she be but
good!"
"That would make all well!”

“And would you marry a woman like that, now?” continued Gania, never
taking his excited eyes off the prince’s face."
"“I cannot marry at all,” said the latter."
"“I am an invalid.”

“Would Rogojin marry her, do you think?”

“Why not?"
"Certainly he would, I should think."
"He would marry her
tomorrow!--marry her tomorrow and murder her in a week!”

Hardly had the prince uttered the last word when Gania gave such a
fearful shudder that the prince almost cried out."
"“What’s the matter?” said he, seizing Gania’s hand."
“Your highness!
"His excellency begs your presence in her excellency’s
apartments!” announced the footman, appearing at the door."
The prince immediately followed the man out of the room.
IV.
"All three of the Miss Epanchins were fine, healthy girls, well-grown,
with good shoulders and busts, and strong--almost masculine--hands;
and, of course, with all the above attributes, they enjoyed capital
appetites, of which they were not in the least ashamed."
"Elizabetha Prokofievna sometimes informed the girls that they were
a little too candid in this matter, but in spite of their outward
deference to their mother these three young women, in solemn conclave,
had long agreed to modify the unquestioning obedience which they had
been in the habit of according to her; and Mrs. General Epanchin had
judged it better to say nothing about it, though, of course, she was
well aware of the fact."
"It is true that her nature sometimes rebelled against these dictates
of reason, and that she grew yearly more capricious and impatient; but
having a respectful and well-disciplined husband under her thumb at
all times, she found it possible, as a rule, to empty any little
accumulations of spleen upon his head, and therefore the harmony of the
family was kept duly balanced, and things went as smoothly as family
matters can."
"Mrs. Epanchin had a fair appetite herself, and generally took her share
of the capital mid-day lunch which was always served for the girls, and
which was nearly as good as a dinner."
"The young ladies used to have a
cup of coffee each before this meal, at ten o’clock, while still in bed."
This was a favourite and unalterable arrangement with them.
"At half-past
twelve, the table was laid in the small dining-room, and occasionally
the general himself appeared at the family gathering, if he had time."
"Besides tea and coffee, cheese, honey, butter, pan-cakes of various
kinds (the lady of the house loved these best), cutlets, and so on,
there was generally strong beef soup, and other substantial delicacies."
"On the particular morning on which our story has opened, the family had
assembled in the dining-room, and were waiting the general’s appearance,
the latter having promised to come this day."
"If he had been one moment
late, he would have been sent for at once; but he turned up punctually."
"As he came forward to wish his wife good-morning and kiss her hands, as
his custom was, he observed something in her look which boded ill."
"He
thought he knew the reason, and had expected it, but still, he was not
altogether comfortable."
"His daughters advanced to kiss him, too, and
though they did not look exactly angry, there was something strange in
their expression as well."
"The general was, owing to certain circumstances, a little inclined to be
too suspicious at home, and needlessly nervous; but, as an experienced
father and husband, he judged it better to take measures at once to
protect himself from any dangers there might be in the air."
"However, I hope I shall not interfere with the proper sequence of my
narrative too much, if I diverge for a moment at this point, in order
to explain the mutual relations between General Epanchin’s family and
others acting a part in this history, at the time when we take up the
thread of their destiny."
"I have already stated that the general, though
he was a man of lowly origin, and of poor education, was, for all that,
an experienced and talented husband and father."
"Among other things,
he considered it undesirable to hurry his daughters to the matrimonial
altar and to worry them too much with assurances of his paternal wishes
for their happiness, as is the custom among parents of many grown-up
daughters."
"He even succeeded in ranging his wife on his side on this
question, though he found the feat very difficult to accomplish, because
unnatural; but the general’s arguments were conclusive, and founded upon
obvious facts."
"The general considered that the girls’ taste and good
sense should be allowed to develop and mature deliberately, and that the
parents’ duty should merely be to keep watch, in order that no strange
or undesirable choice be made; but that the selection once effected,
both father and mother were bound from that moment to enter heart and
soul into the cause, and to see that the matter progressed without
hindrance until the altar should be happily reached."
"Besides this, it was clear that the Epanchins’ position gained each
year, with geometrical accuracy, both as to financial solidity and
social weight; and, therefore, the longer the girls waited, the better
was their chance of making a brilliant match."
"But again, amidst the incontrovertible facts just recorded, one more,
equally significant, rose up to confront the family; and this was,
that the eldest daughter, Alexandra, had imperceptibly arrived at her
twenty-fifth birthday."
"Almost at the same moment, Afanasy Ivanovitch
Totski, a man of immense wealth, high connections, and good standing,
announced his intention of marrying."
"Afanasy Ivanovitch was a gentleman
of fifty-five years of age, artistically gifted, and of most refined
tastes."
"He wished to marry well, and, moreover, he was a keen admirer
and judge of beauty."
"Now, since Totski had, of late, been upon terms of great cordiality with
Epanchin, which excellent relations were intensified by the fact that
they were, so to speak, partners in several financial enterprises, it
so happened that the former now put in a friendly request to the general
for counsel with regard to the important step he meditated."
"Might he
suggest, for instance, such a thing as a marriage between himself and
one of the general’s daughters?"
"Evidently the quiet, pleasant current of the family life of the
Epanchins was about to undergo a change."
"The undoubted beauty of the family, _par excellence_, was the youngest,
Aglaya, as aforesaid."
"But Totski himself, though an egotist of the
extremest type, realized that he had no chance there; Aglaya was clearly
not for such as he."
"Perhaps the sisterly love and friendship of the three girls had more or
less exaggerated Aglaya’s chances of happiness."
"In their opinion, the
latter’s destiny was not merely to be very happy; she was to live in
a heaven on earth."
"Aglaya’s husband was to be a compendium of all the
virtues, and of all success, not to speak of fabulous wealth."
"The two
elder sisters had agreed that all was to be sacrificed by them, if need
be, for Aglaya’s sake; her dowry was to be colossal and unprecedented."
"The general and his wife were aware of this agreement, and, therefore,
when Totski suggested himself for one of the sisters, the parents made
no doubt that one of the two elder girls would probably accept the
offer, since Totski would certainly make no difficulty as to dowry."
"The
general valued the proposal very highly."
"He knew life, and realized what
such an offer was worth."
"The answer of the sisters to the communication was, if not conclusive,
at least consoling and hopeful."
"It made known that the eldest,
Alexandra, would very likely be disposed to listen to a proposal."
"Alexandra was a good-natured girl, though she had a will of her own."
"She
was intelligent and kind-hearted, and, if she were to marry Totski, she
would make him a good wife."
"She did not care for a brilliant marriage;
she was eminently a woman calculated to soothe and sweeten the life of
any man; decidedly pretty, if not absolutely handsome."
"What better could
Totski wish?"
So the matter crept slowly forward.
"The general and Totski had agreed to
avoid any hasty and irrevocable step."
"Alexandra’s parents had not even
begun to talk to their daughters freely upon the subject, when suddenly,
as it were, a dissonant chord was struck amid the harmony of the
proceedings."
"Mrs. Epanchin began to show signs of discontent, and
that was a serious matter."
"A certain circumstance had crept in, a
disagreeable and troublesome factor, which threatened to overturn the
whole business."
This circumstance had come into existence eighteen years before.
"Close
to an estate of Totski’s, in one of the central provinces of Russia,
there lived, at that time, a poor gentleman whose estate was of the
wretchedest description."
"This gentleman was noted in the district for
his persistent ill-fortune; his name was Barashkoff, and, as regards
family and descent, he was vastly superior to Totski, but his estate was
mortgaged to the last acre."
"One day, when he had ridden over to the town
to see a creditor, the chief peasant of his village followed him shortly
after, with the news that his house had been burnt down, and that his
wife had perished with it, but his children were safe."
"Even Barashkoff, inured to the storms of evil fortune as he was, could
not stand this last stroke."
"He went mad and died shortly after in the
town hospital."
"His estate was sold for the creditors; and the little
girls--two of them, of seven and eight years of age respectively,--were
adopted by Totski, who undertook their maintenance and education in the
kindness of his heart."
"They were brought up together with the children
of his German bailiff."
"Very soon, however, there was only one of
them left--Nastasia Philipovna--for the other little one died of
whooping-cough."
"Totski, who was living abroad at this time, very soon
forgot all about the child; but five years after, returning to Russia,
it struck him that he would like to look over his estate and see how
matters were going there, and, arrived at his bailiff’s house, he was
not long in discovering that among the children of the latter there now
dwelt a most lovely little girl of twelve, sweet and intelligent, and
bright, and promising to develop beauty of most unusual quality--as to
which last Totski was an undoubted authority."
"He only stayed at his country seat a few days on this occasion, but
he had time to make his arrangements."
"Great changes took place in
the child’s education; a good governess was engaged, a Swiss lady of
experience and culture."
"For four years this lady resided in the house
with little Nastia, and then the education was considered complete."
"The governess took her departure, and another lady came down to fetch
Nastia, by Totski’s instructions."
"The child was now transported to
another of Totski’s estates in a distant part of the country."
"Here
she found a delightful little house, just built, and prepared for her
reception with great care and taste; and here she took up her abode
together with the lady who had accompanied her from her old home."
"In
the house there were two experienced maids, musical instruments of
all sorts, a charming “young lady’s library,” pictures, paint-boxes,
a lap-dog, and everything to make life agreeable."
"Within a fortnight
Totski himself arrived, and from that time he appeared to have taken a
great fancy to this part of the world and came down each summer, staying
two and three months at a time."
"So passed four years peacefully and
happily, in charming surroundings."
"At the end of that time, and about four months after Totski’s last
visit (he had stayed but a fortnight on this occasion), a report reached
Nastasia Philipovna that he was about to be married in St. Petersburg,
to a rich, eminent, and lovely woman."
"The report was only partially
true, the marriage project being only in an embryo condition; but a
great change now came over Nastasia Philipovna."
"She suddenly displayed
unusual decision of character; and without wasting time in thought,
she left her country home and came up to St. Petersburg, straight to
Totski’s house, all alone."
"The latter, amazed at her conduct, began to express his displeasure;
but he very soon became aware that he must change his voice, style, and
everything else, with this young lady; the good old times were gone."
"An
entirely new and different woman sat before him, between whom and
the girl he had left in the country last July there seemed nothing in
common."
"In the first place, this new woman understood a good deal more than was
usual for young people of her age; so much indeed, that Totski could not
help wondering where she had picked up her knowledge."
"Surely not from
her “young lady’s library”?"
"It even embraced legal matters, and the
“world” in general, to a considerable extent."
Her character was absolutely changed.
"No more of the girlish
alternations of timidity and petulance, the adorable naivete, the
reveries, the tears, the playfulness..."
"It was an entirely new and
hitherto unknown being who now sat and laughed at him, and informed him
to his face that she had never had the faintest feeling for him of any
kind, except loathing and contempt--contempt which had followed closely
upon her sensations of surprise and bewilderment after her first
acquaintance with him."
"This new woman gave him further to understand that though it was
absolutely the same to her whom he married, yet she had decided to
prevent this marriage--for no particular reason, but that she _chose_ to
do so, and because she wished to amuse herself at his expense for that
it was “quite her turn to laugh a little now!”

Such were her words--very likely she did not give her real reason for
this eccentric conduct; but, at all events, that was all the explanation
she deigned to offer."
"Meanwhile, Totski thought the matter over as well as his scattered ideas
would permit."
"His meditations lasted a fortnight, however, and at the
end of that time his resolution was taken."
"The fact was, Totski was
at that time a man of fifty years of age; his position was solid and
respectable; his place in society had long been firmly fixed upon safe
foundations; he loved himself, his personal comforts, and his position
better than all the world, as every respectable gentleman should!"
"At the same time his grasp of things in general soon showed Totski that
he now had to deal with a being who was outside the pale of the ordinary
rules of traditional behaviour, and who would not only threaten mischief
but would undoubtedly carry it out, and stop for no one."
"There was evidently, he concluded, something at work here; some storm of
the mind, some paroxysm of romantic anger, goodness knows against whom
or what, some insatiable contempt--in a word, something altogether
absurd and impossible, but at the same time most dangerous to be met
with by any respectable person with a position in society to keep up."
"For a man of Totski’s wealth and standing, it would, of course, have
been the simplest possible matter to take steps which would rid him at
once from all annoyance; while it was obviously impossible for Nastasia
Philipovna to harm him in any way, either legally or by stirring up a
scandal, for, in case of the latter danger, he could so easily remove
her to a sphere of safety."
"However, these arguments would only hold good
in case of Nastasia acting as others might in such an emergency."
"She was
much more likely to overstep the bounds of reasonable conduct by some
extraordinary eccentricity."
Here the sound judgment of Totski stood him in good stead.
"He realized
that Nastasia Philipovna must be well aware that she could do nothing
by legal means to injure him, and that her flashing eyes betrayed some
entirely different intention."
"Nastasia Philipovna was quite capable of ruining herself, and even of
perpetrating something which would send her to Siberia, for the mere
pleasure of injuring a man for whom she had developed so inhuman a sense
of loathing and contempt."
"He had sufficient insight to understand that
she valued nothing in the world--herself least of all--and he made no
attempt to conceal the fact that he was a coward in some respects."
"For
instance, if he had been told that he would be stabbed at the altar, or
publicly insulted, he would undoubtedly have been frightened; but not so
much at the idea of being murdered, or wounded, or insulted, as at the
thought that if such things were to happen he would be made to look
ridiculous in the eyes of society."
"He knew well that Nastasia thoroughly understood him and where to wound
him and how, and therefore, as the marriage was still only in embryo,
Totski decided to conciliate her by giving it up."
"His decision was
strengthened by the fact that Nastasia Philipovna had curiously altered
of late."
"It would be difficult to conceive how different she was
physically, at the present time, to the girl of a few years ago."
"She was
pretty then... but now!..."
"Totski laughed angrily when he thought how
short-sighted he had been."
"In days gone by he remembered how he had
looked at her beautiful eyes, how even then he had marvelled at their
dark mysterious depths, and at their wondering gaze which seemed to seek
an answer to some unknown riddle."
Her complexion also had altered.
"She
was now exceedingly pale, but, curiously, this change only made her more
beautiful."
"Like most men of the world, Totski had rather despised such
a cheaply-bought conquest, but of late years he had begun to think
differently about it."
"It had struck him as long ago as last spring that
he ought to be finding a good match for Nastasia; for instance, some
respectable and reasonable young fellow serving in a government office
in another part of the country."
"How maliciously Nastasia laughed at the
idea of such a thing, now!"
"However, it appeared to Totski that he might make use of her in another
way; and he determined to establish her in St. Petersburg, surrounding
her with all the comforts and luxuries that his wealth could command."
"In
this way he might gain glory in certain circles."
"Five years of this Petersburg life went by, and, of course, during that
time a great deal happened."
"Totski’s position was very uncomfortable;
having “funked” once, he could not totally regain his ease."
"He was
afraid, he did not know why, but he was simply _afraid_ of Nastasia
Philipovna."
"For the first two years or so he had suspected that she
wished to marry him herself, and that only her vanity prevented her
telling him so."
"He thought that she wanted him to approach her with a
humble proposal from his own side."
"But to his great, and not entirely
pleasurable amazement, he discovered that this was by no means the case,
and that were he to offer himself he would be refused."
"He could not
understand such a state of things, and was obliged to conclude that it
was pride, the pride of an injured and imaginative woman, which had
gone to such lengths that it preferred to sit and nurse its contempt and
hatred in solitude rather than mount to heights of hitherto unattainable
splendour."
"To make matters worse, she was quite impervious to mercenary
considerations, and could not be bribed in any way."
"Finally, Totski took cunning means to try to break his chains and
be free."
"He tried to tempt her in various ways to lose her heart; he
invited princes, hussars, secretaries of embassies, poets, novelists,
even Socialists, to see her; but not one of them all made the faintest
impression upon Nastasia."
"It was as though she had a pebble in place
of a heart, as though her feelings and affections were dried up and
withered for ever."
"She lived almost entirely alone; she read, she studied, she loved music."
"Her principal acquaintances were poor women of various grades, a couple
of actresses, and the family of a poor schoolteacher."
"Among these people
she was much beloved."
"She received four or five friends sometimes, of an evening."
"Totski
often came."
"Lately, too, General Epanchin had been enabled with
great difficulty to introduce himself into her circle."
"Gania made
her acquaintance also, and others were Ferdishenko, an ill-bred, and
would-be witty, young clerk, and Ptitsin, a money-lender of modest
and polished manners, who had risen from poverty."
"In fact, Nastasia
Philipovna’s beauty became a thing known to all the town; but not a
single man could boast of anything more than his own admiration for
her; and this reputation of hers, and her wit and culture and grace, all
confirmed Totski in the plan he had now prepared."
"And it was at this moment that General Epanchin began to play so large
and important a part in the story."
"When Totski had approached the general with his request for friendly
counsel as to a marriage with one of his daughters, he had made a full
and candid confession."
"He had said that he intended to stop at no means
to obtain his freedom; even if Nastasia were to promise to leave him
entirely alone in future, he would not (he said) believe and trust her;
words were not enough for him; he must have solid guarantees of some
sort."
"So he and the general determined to try what an attempt to appeal
to her heart would effect."
"Having arrived at Nastasia’s house one day,
with Epanchin, Totski immediately began to speak of the intolerable
torment of his position."
"He admitted that he was to blame for all, but
candidly confessed that he could not bring himself to feel any remorse
for his original guilt towards herself, because he was a man of sensual
passions which were inborn and ineradicable, and that he had no power
over himself in this respect; but that he wished, seriously, to marry at
last, and that the whole fate of the most desirable social union which
he contemplated, was in her hands; in a word, he confided his all to her
generosity of heart."
"General Epanchin took up his part and spoke in the character of father
of a family; he spoke sensibly, and without wasting words over any
attempt at sentimentality, he merely recorded his full admission of
her right to be the arbiter of Totski’s destiny at this moment."
"He then
pointed out that the fate of his daughter, and very likely of both his
other daughters, now hung upon her reply."
"To Nastasia’s question as to what they wished her to do, Totski
confessed that he had been so frightened by her, five years ago, that
he could never now be entirely comfortable until she herself married."
"He
immediately added that such a suggestion from him would, of course, be
absurd, unless accompanied by remarks of a more pointed nature."
"He
very well knew, he said, that a certain young gentleman of good family,
namely, Gavrila Ardalionovitch Ivolgin, with whom she was acquainted,
and whom she received at her house, had long loved her passionately,
and would give his life for some response from her."
"The young fellow had
confessed this love of his to him (Totski) and had also admitted it in
the hearing of his benefactor, General Epanchin."
"Lastly, he could not
help being of opinion that Nastasia must be aware of Gania’s love for
her, and if he (Totski) mistook not, she had looked with some favour
upon it, being often lonely, and rather tired of her present life."
"Having remarked how difficult it was for him, of all people, to speak
to her of these matters, Totski concluded by saying that he trusted
Nastasia Philipovna would not look with contempt upon him if he now
expressed his sincere desire to guarantee her future by a gift of
seventy-five thousand roubles."
"He added that the sum would have been
left her all the same in his will, and that therefore she must not
consider the gift as in any way an indemnification to her for anything,
but that there was no reason, after all, why a man should not be allowed
to entertain a natural desire to lighten his conscience, etc., etc."
"; in
fact, all that would naturally be said under the circumstances."
"Totski
was very eloquent all through, and, in conclusion, just touched on the
fact that not a soul in the world, not even General Epanchin, had ever
heard a word about the above seventy-five thousand roubles, and that
this was the first time he had ever given expression to his intentions
in respect to them."
"Nastasia Philipovna’s reply to this long rigmarole astonished both the
friends considerably."
"Not only was there no trace of her former irony, of her old hatred and
enmity, and of that dreadful laughter, the very recollection of which
sent a cold chill down Totski’s back to this very day; but she seemed
charmed and really glad to have the opportunity of talking seriously
with him for once in a way."
"She confessed that she had long wished to
have a frank and free conversation and to ask for friendly advice, but
that pride had hitherto prevented her; now, however, that the ice was
broken, nothing could be more welcome to her than this opportunity."
"First, with a sad smile, and then with a twinkle of merriment in her
eyes, she admitted that such a storm as that of five years ago was now
quite out of the question."
"She said that she had long since changed
her views of things, and recognized that facts must be taken into
consideration in spite of the feelings of the heart."
"What was done was
done and ended, and she could not understand why Totski should still
feel alarmed."
"She next turned to General Epanchin and observed, most courteously, that
she had long since known of his daughters, and that she had heard none
but good report; that she had learned to think of them with deep and
sincere respect."
"The idea alone that she could in any way serve them,
would be to her both a pride and a source of real happiness."
"It was true that she was lonely in her present life; Totski had judged
her thoughts aright."
"She longed to rise, if not to love, at least to
family life and new hopes and objects, but as to Gavrila Ardalionovitch,
she could not as yet say much."
"She thought it must be the case that he
loved her; she felt that she too might learn to love him, if she could
be sure of the firmness of his attachment to herself; but he was very
young, and it was a difficult question to decide."
"What she specially
liked about him was that he worked, and supported his family by his
toil."
"She had heard that he was proud and ambitious; she had heard much that
was interesting of his mother and sister, she had heard of them from Mr.
Ptitsin, and would much like to make their acquaintance, but--another
question!--would they like to receive her into their house?"
"At all
events, though she did not reject the idea of this marriage, she desired
not to be hurried."
"As for the seventy-five thousand roubles, Mr. Totski
need not have found any difficulty or awkwardness about the matter; she
quite understood the value of money, and would, of course, accept the
gift."
"She thanked him for his delicacy, however, but saw no reason why
Gavrila Ardalionovitch should not know about it."
"She would not marry the latter, she said, until she felt persuaded that
neither on his part nor on the part of his family did there exist any
sort of concealed suspicions as to herself."
"She did not intend to ask
forgiveness for anything in the past, which fact she desired to be
known."
"She did not consider herself to blame for anything that had
happened in former years, and she thought that Gavrila Ardalionovitch
should be informed as to the relations which had existed between herself
and Totski during the last five years."
"If she accepted this money it was
not to be considered as indemnification for her misfortune as a young
girl, which had not been in any degree her own fault, but merely as
compensation for her ruined life."
"She became so excited and agitated during all these explanations and
confessions that General Epanchin was highly gratified, and considered
the matter satisfactorily arranged once for all."
"But the once bitten
Totski was twice shy, and looked for hidden snakes among the flowers."
"However, the special point to which the two friends particularly trusted
to bring about their object (namely, Gania’s attractiveness for Nastasia
Philipovna), stood out more and more prominently; the pourparlers had
commenced, and gradually even Totski began to believe in the possibility
of success."
Before long Nastasia and Gania had talked the matter over.
"Very
little was said--her modesty seemed to suffer under the infliction
of discussing such a question."
"But she recognized his love, on the
understanding that she bound herself to nothing whatever, and that
she reserved the right to say “no” up to the very hour of the marriage
ceremony."
"Gania was to have the same right of refusal at the last
moment."
"It soon became clear to Gania, after scenes of wrath and quarrellings
at the domestic hearth, that his family were seriously opposed to the
match, and that Nastasia was aware of this fact was equally evident."
"She
said nothing about it, though he daily expected her to do so."
"There were several rumours afloat, before long, which upset Totski’s
equanimity a good deal, but we will not now stop to describe them;
merely mentioning an instance or two."
"One was that Nastasia had entered
into close and secret relations with the Epanchin girls--a most unlikely
rumour; another was that Nastasia had long satisfied herself of the fact
that Gania was merely marrying her for money, and that his nature was
gloomy and greedy, impatient and selfish, to an extraordinary degree;
and that although he had been keen enough in his desire to achieve a
conquest before, yet since the two friends had agreed to exploit his
passion for their own purposes, it was clear enough that he had begun to
consider the whole thing a nuisance and a nightmare."
"In his heart passion and hate seemed to hold divided sway, and although
he had at last given his consent to marry the woman (as he said), under
the stress of circumstances, yet he promised himself that he would “take
it out of her,” after marriage."
"Nastasia seemed to Totski to have divined all this, and to be preparing
something on her own account, which frightened him to such an extent
that he did not dare communicate his views even to the general."
"But at
times he would pluck up his courage and be full of hope and good spirits
again, acting, in fact, as weak men do act in such circumstances."
"However, both the friends felt that the thing looked rosy indeed when
one day Nastasia informed them that she would give her final answer on
the evening of her birthday, which anniversary was due in a very short
time."
"A strange rumour began to circulate, meanwhile; no less than that
the respectable and highly respected General Epanchin was himself so
fascinated by Nastasia Philipovna that his feeling for her amounted
almost to passion."
"What he thought to gain by Gania’s marriage to
the girl it was difficult to imagine."
"Possibly he counted on Gania’s
complaisance; for Totski had long suspected that there existed some
secret understanding between the general and his secretary."
"At all
events the fact was known that he had prepared a magnificent present of
pearls for Nastasia’s birthday, and that he was looking forward to the
occasion when he should present his gift with the greatest excitement
and impatience."
"The day before her birthday he was in a fever of
agitation."
"Mrs. Epanchin, long accustomed to her husband’s infidelities, had
heard of the pearls, and the rumour excited her liveliest curiosity and
interest."
"The general remarked her suspicions, and felt that a grand
explanation must shortly take place--which fact alarmed him much."
"This is the reason why he was so unwilling to take lunch (on the morning
upon which we took up this narrative) with the rest of his family."
"Before the prince’s arrival he had made up his mind to plead business,
and “cut” the meal; which simply meant running away."
"He was particularly anxious that this one day should be
passed--especially the evening--without unpleasantness between himself
and his family; and just at the right moment the prince turned up--“as
though Heaven had sent him on purpose,” said the general to himself, as
he left the study to seek out the wife of his bosom."
"V.

Mrs. General Epanchin was a proud woman by nature."
"What must her
feelings have been when she heard that Prince Muishkin, the last of
his and her line, had arrived in beggar’s guise, a wretched idiot, a
recipient of charity--all of which details the general gave out for
greater effect!"
"He was anxious to steal her interest at the first swoop,
so as to distract her thoughts from other matters nearer home."
"Mrs. Epanchin was in the habit of holding herself very straight, and
staring before her, without speaking, in moments of excitement."
"She was a fine woman of the same age as her husband, with a slightly
hooked nose, a high, narrow forehead, thick hair turning a little grey,
and a sallow complexion."
"Her eyes were grey and wore a very curious
expression at times."
"She believed them to be most effective--a belief
that nothing could alter."
"“What, receive him!"
"Now, at once?” asked Mrs. Epanchin, gazing vaguely
at her husband as he stood fidgeting before her."
"“Oh, dear me, I assure you there is no need to stand on ceremony with
him,” the general explained hastily."
"“He is quite a child, not to say
a pathetic-looking creature."
"He has fits of some sort, and has just
arrived from Switzerland, straight from the station, dressed like a
German and without a farthing in his pocket."
"I gave him twenty-five
roubles to go on with, and am going to find him some easy place in one
of the government offices."
"I should like you to ply him well with the
victuals, my dears, for I should think he must be very hungry.”

“You astonish me,” said the lady, gazing as before."
"“Fits, and hungry
too!"
"What sort of fits?”

“Oh, they don’t come on frequently, besides, he’s a regular child,
though he seems to be fairly educated."
"I should like you, if possible,
my dears,” the general added, making slowly for the door, “to put him
through his paces a bit, and see what he is good for."
"I think you should
be kind to him; it is a good deed, you know--however, just as you like,
of course--but he is a sort of relation, remember, and I thought it
might interest you to see the young fellow, seeing that this is so.”

“Oh, of course, mamma, if we needn’t stand on ceremony with him, we must
give the poor fellow something to eat after his journey; especially as
he has not the least idea where to go to,” said Alexandra, the eldest of
the girls."
"“Besides, he’s quite a child; we can entertain him with a little
hide-and-seek, in case of need,” said Adelaida."
“Hide-and-seek?
What do you mean?” inquired Mrs. Epanchin.
"“Oh, do stop pretending, mamma,” cried Aglaya, in vexation."
"“Send him
up, father; mother allows.”

The general rang the bell and gave orders that the prince should be
shown in."
"“Only on condition that he has a napkin under his chin at lunch, then,”
 said Mrs. Epanchin, “and let Fedor, or Mavra, stand behind him while he
eats."
Is he quiet when he has these fits?
"He doesn’t show violence, does
he?”

“On the contrary, he seems to be very well brought up."
"His manners
are excellent--but here he is himself."
"Here you are, prince--let me
introduce you, the last of the Muishkins, a relative of your own, my
dear, or at least of the same name."
"Receive him kindly, please."
"They’ll
bring in lunch directly, prince; you must stop and have some, but you
must excuse me."
"I’m in a hurry, I must be off--”

“We all know where _you_ must be off to!” said Mrs. Epanchin, in a meaning
voice."
"“Yes, yes--I must hurry away, I’m late!"
"Look here, dears, let him
write you something in your albums; you’ve no idea what a wonderful
caligraphist he is, wonderful talent!"
"He has just written out ‘Abbot
Pafnute signed this’ for me."
"Well, _au revoir!_”

“Stop a minute; where are you off to?"
"Who is this abbot?” cried Mrs.
Epanchin to her retreating husband in a tone of excited annoyance."
"“Yes, my dear, it was an old abbot of that name--I must be off to see the
count, he’s waiting for me, I’m late--Good-bye!"
"_Au revoir_, prince!”--and
the general bolted at full speed."
"“Oh, yes--I know what count you’re going to see!” remarked his wife in
a cutting manner, as she turned her angry eyes on the prince."
"“Now
then, what’s all this about?--What abbot--Who’s Pafnute?” she added,
brusquely."
"“Mamma!” said Alexandra, shocked at her rudeness."
Aglaya stamped her foot.
“Nonsense!
Let me alone!” said the angry mother.
"“Now then, prince, sit
down here, no, nearer, come nearer the light!"
"I want to have a good look
at you."
"So, now then, who is this abbot?”

“Abbot Pafnute,” said our friend, seriously and with deference."
"“Pafnute, yes."
"And who was he?”

Mrs. Epanchin put these questions hastily and brusquely, and when the
prince answered she nodded her head sagely at each word he said."
"“The Abbot Pafnute lived in the fourteenth century,” began the prince;
“he was in charge of one of the monasteries on the Volga, about where
our present Kostroma government lies."
"He went to Oreol and helped in the
great matters then going on in the religious world; he signed an edict
there, and I have seen a print of his signature; it struck me, so I
copied it."
"When the general asked me, in his study, to write something
for him, to show my handwriting, I wrote ‘The Abbot Pafnute signed
this,’ in the exact handwriting of the abbot."
"The general liked it very
much, and that’s why he recalled it just now.”

“Aglaya, make a note of ‘Pafnute,’ or we shall forget him."
H’m!
"and
where is this signature?”

“I think it was left on the general’s table.”

“Let it be sent for at once!”

“Oh, I’ll write you a new one in half a minute,” said the prince, “if
you like!”

“Of course, mamma!” said Alexandra."
"“But let’s have lunch now, we are
all hungry!”

“Yes; come along, prince,” said the mother, “are you very hungry?”

“Yes; I must say that I am pretty hungry, thanks very much.”

“H’m!"
"I like to see that you know your manners; and you are by no means
such a person as the general thought fit to describe you."
"Come along;
you sit here, opposite to me,” she continued, “I wish to be able to see
your face."
"Alexandra, Adelaida, look after the prince!"
"He doesn’t seem
so very ill, does he?"
"I don’t think he requires a napkin under his chin,
after all; are you accustomed to having one on, prince?”

“Formerly, when I was seven years old or so."
"I believe I wore one; but
now I usually hold my napkin on my knee when I eat.”

“Of course, of course!"
"And about your fits?”

“Fits?” asked the prince, slightly surprised."
"“I very seldom have fits
nowadays."
"I don’t know how it may be here, though; they say the climate
may be bad for me.”

“He talks very well, you know!” said Mrs. Epanchin, who still continued
to nod at each word the prince spoke."
"“I really did not expect it at
all; in fact, I suppose it was all stuff and nonsense on the general’s
part, as usual."
"Eat away, prince, and tell me where you were born, and
where you were brought up."
"I wish to know all about you, you interest me
very much!”

The prince expressed his thanks once more, and eating heartily the
while, recommenced the narrative of his life in Switzerland, all of
which we have heard before."
"Mrs. Epanchin became more and more pleased
with her guest; the girls, too, listened with considerable attention."
"In
talking over the question of relationship it turned out that the prince
was very well up in the matter and knew his pedigree off by heart."
"It
was found that scarcely any connection existed between himself and Mrs.
Epanchin, but the talk, and the opportunity of conversing about her
family tree, gratified the latter exceedingly, and she rose from the
table in great good humour."
"“Let’s all go to my boudoir,” she said, “and they shall bring some
coffee in there."
"That’s the room where we all assemble and busy
ourselves as we like best,” she explained."
"“Alexandra, my eldest,
here, plays the piano, or reads or sews; Adelaida paints landscapes and
portraits (but never finishes any); and Aglaya sits and does nothing."
"I don’t work too much, either."
"Here we are, now; sit down, prince, near
the fire and talk to us."
I want to hear you relate something.
"I wish
to make sure of you first and then tell my old friend, Princess
Bielokonski, about you."
"I wish you to know all the good people and to
interest them."
"Now then, begin!”

“Mamma, it’s rather a strange order, that!” said Adelaida, who was
fussing among her paints and paint-brushes at the easel."
"Aglaya and
Alexandra had settled themselves with folded hands on a sofa, evidently
meaning to be listeners."
"The prince felt that the general attention was
concentrated upon himself."
"“I should refuse to say a word if _I_ were ordered to tell a story like
that!” observed Aglaya."
“Why?
what’s there strange about it?
He has a tongue.
"Why shouldn’t he
tell us something?"
"I want to judge whether he is a good story-teller;
anything you like, prince--how you liked Switzerland, what was your first
impression, anything."
"You’ll see, he’ll begin directly and tell us all
about it beautifully.”

“The impression was forcible--” the prince began."
"“There, you see, girls,” said the impatient lady, “he _has_ begun, you
see.”

“Well, then, _let_ him talk, mamma,” said Alexandra."
"“This prince is a
great humbug and by no means an idiot,” she whispered to Aglaya."
"“Oh, I saw that at once,” replied the latter."
"“I don’t think it at all
nice of him to play a part."
"What does he wish to gain by it, I wonder?”

“My first impression was a very strong one,” repeated the prince."
"“When
they took me away from Russia, I remember I passed through many German
towns and looked out of the windows, but did not trouble so much as to
ask questions about them."
This was after a long series of fits.
"I always
used to fall into a sort of torpid condition after such a series, and
lost my memory almost entirely; and though I was not altogether without
reason at such times, yet I had no logical power of thought."
"This would
continue for three or four days, and then I would recover myself again."
"I remember my melancholy was intolerable; I felt inclined to cry; I
sat and wondered and wondered uncomfortably; the consciousness that
everything was strange weighed terribly upon me; I could understand that
it was all foreign and strange."
"I recollect I awoke from this state for
the first time at Basle, one evening; the bray of a donkey aroused me,
a donkey in the town market."
"I saw the donkey and was extremely pleased
with it, and from that moment my head seemed to clear.”

“A donkey?"
How strange!
Yet it is not strange.
"Anyone of us might fall
in love with a donkey!"
"It happened in mythological times,” said Madame
Epanchin, looking wrathfully at her daughters, who had begun to laugh."
"“Go on, prince.”

“Since that evening I have been specially fond of donkeys."
"I began to
ask questions about them, for I had never seen one before; and I at
once came to the conclusion that this must be one of the most useful of
animals--strong, willing, patient, cheap; and, thanks to this donkey,
I began to like the whole country I was travelling through; and my
melancholy passed away.”

“All this is very strange and interesting,” said Mrs. Epanchin."
"“Now
let’s leave the donkey and go on to other matters."
"What are you laughing
at, Aglaya?"
"and you too, Adelaida?"
"The prince told us his experiences
very cleverly; he saw the donkey himself, and what have you ever seen?"
"_you_ have never been abroad.”

“I have seen a donkey though, mamma!” said Aglaya."
“And I’ve heard one!” said Adelaida.
"All three of the girls laughed out
loud, and the prince laughed with them."
"“Well, it’s too bad of you,” said mamma."
"“You must forgive them, prince;
they are good girls."
"I am very fond of them, though I often have to be
scolding them; they are all as silly and mad as march hares.”

“Oh, why shouldn’t they laugh?” said the prince."
"“I shouldn’t have let
the chance go by in their place, I know."
"But I stick up for the donkey,
all the same; he’s a patient, good-natured fellow.”

“Are you a patient man, prince?"
"I ask out of curiosity,” said Mrs.
Epanchin."
All laughed again.
"“Oh, that wretched donkey again, I see!” cried the lady."
"“I assure you,
prince, I was not guilty of the least--”

“Insinuation?"
Oh!
"I assure you, I take your word for it.” And the prince
continued laughing merrily."
“I must say it’s very nice of you to laugh.
"I see you really are a
kind-hearted fellow,” said Mrs. Epanchin."
"“I’m not always kind, though.”

“I am kind myself, and _always_ kind too, if you please!” she retorted,
unexpectedly; “and that is my chief fault, for one ought not to be
always kind."
"I am often angry with these girls and their father; but the
worst of it is, I am always kindest when I am cross."
"I was very angry
just before you came, and Aglaya there read me a lesson--thanks, Aglaya,
dear--come and kiss me--there--that’s enough” she added, as Aglaya came
forward and kissed her lips and then her hand."
"“Now then, go on, prince."
"Perhaps you can think of something more exciting than about the donkey,
eh?”

“I must say, again, _I_ can’t understand how you can expect anyone to tell
you stories straight away, so,” said Adelaida."
"“I know I never could!”

“Yes, but the prince can, because he is clever--cleverer than you are
by ten or twenty times, if you like."
"There, that’s so, prince; and
seriously, let’s drop the donkey now--what else did you see abroad,
besides the donkey?”

“Yes, but the prince told us about the donkey very cleverly, all the
same,” said Alexandra."
"“I have always been most interested to hear how
people go mad and get well again, and that sort of thing."
"Especially
when it happens suddenly.”

“Quite so, quite so!” cried Mrs. Epanchin, delighted."
"“I see you _can_
be sensible now and then, Alexandra."
"You were speaking of Switzerland,
prince?”

“Yes."
"We came to Lucerne, and I was taken out in a boat."
"I felt how
lovely it was, but the loveliness weighed upon me somehow or other, and
made me feel melancholy.”

“Why?” asked Alexandra."
"“I don’t know; I always feel like that when I look at the beauties of
nature for the first time; but then, I was ill at that time, of course!”

“Oh, but I should like to see it!” said Adelaida; “and I don’t know
_when_ we shall ever go abroad."
"I’ve been two years looking out for a good
subject for a picture."
I’ve done all I know.
"‘The North and South I know
by heart,’ as our poet observes."
"Do help me to a subject, prince.”

“Oh, but I know nothing about painting."
"It seems to me one only has to
look, and paint what one sees.”

“But I don’t know _how_ to see!”

“Nonsense, what rubbish you talk!” the mother struck in."
"“Not know how
to see!"
Open your eyes and look!
"If you can’t see here, you won’t see
abroad either."
"Tell us what you saw yourself, prince!”

“Yes, that’s better,” said Adelaida; “the prince _learned to see_ abroad.”

“Oh, I hardly know!"
"You see, I only went to restore my health."
"I don’t
know whether I learned to see, exactly."
"I was very happy, however,
nearly all the time.”

“Happy!"
you can be happy?” cried Aglaya.
"“Then how can you say you did
not learn to see?"
"I should think you could teach _us_ to see!”

“Oh!"
"_do_ teach us,” laughed Adelaida."
“Oh!
"I can’t do that,” said the prince, laughing too."
"“I lived almost
all the while in one little Swiss village; what can I teach you?"
"At
first I was only just not absolutely dull; then my health began to
improve--then every day became dearer and more precious to me, and the
longer I stayed, the dearer became the time to me; so much so that I
could not help observing it; but why this was so, it would be difficult
to say.”

“So that you didn’t care to go away anywhere else?”

“Well, at first I did; I was restless; I didn’t know however I should
manage to support life--you know there are such moments, especially in
solitude."
"There was a waterfall near us, such a lovely thin streak of
water, like a thread but white and moving."
"It fell from a great height,
but it looked quite low, and it was half a mile away, though it did not
seem fifty paces."
"I loved to listen to it at night, but it was then
that I became so restless."
"Sometimes I went and climbed the mountain and
stood there in the midst of the tall pines, all alone in the terrible
silence, with our little village in the distance, and the sky so blue,
and the sun so bright, and an old ruined castle on the mountain-side,
far away."
"I used to watch the line where earth and sky met, and longed
to go and seek there the key of all mysteries, thinking that I might
find there a new life, perhaps some great city where life should be
grander and richer--and then it struck me that life may be grand enough
even in a prison.”

“I read that last most praiseworthy thought in my manual, when I was
twelve years old,” said Aglaya."
"“All this is pure philosophy,” said Adelaida."
"“You are a philosopher,
prince, and have come here to instruct us in your views.”

“Perhaps you are right,” said the prince, smiling."
"“I think I am a
philosopher, perhaps, and who knows, perhaps I do wish to teach my views
of things to those I meet with?”

“Your philosophy is rather like that of an old woman we know, who is
rich and yet does nothing but try how little she can spend."
"She talks of
nothing but money all day."
"Your great philosophical idea of a grand life
in a prison and your four happy years in that Swiss village are like
this, rather,” said Aglaya."
"“As to life in a prison, of course there may be two opinions,” said the
prince."
"“I once heard the story of a man who lived twelve years in a
prison--I heard it from the man himself."
"He was one of the persons under
treatment with my professor; he had fits, and attacks of melancholy,
then he would weep, and once he tried to commit suicide."
"_His_ life in
prison was sad enough; his only acquaintances were spiders and a tree
that grew outside his grating--but I think I had better tell you of
another man I met last year."
"There was a very strange feature in this
case, strange because of its extremely rare occurrence."
"This man had
once been brought to the scaffold in company with several others, and
had had the sentence of death by shooting passed upon him for some
political crime."
"Twenty minutes later he had been reprieved and
some other punishment substituted; but the interval between the two
sentences, twenty minutes, or at least a quarter of an hour, had been
passed in the certainty that within a few minutes he must die."
"I was
very anxious to hear him speak of his impressions during that dreadful
time, and I several times inquired of him as to what he thought and
felt."
"He remembered everything with the most accurate and extraordinary
distinctness, and declared that he would never forget a single iota of
the experience."
"“About twenty paces from the scaffold, where he had stood to hear the
sentence, were three posts, fixed in the ground, to which to fasten the
criminals (of whom there were several)."
"The first three criminals were
taken to the posts, dressed in long white tunics, with white caps drawn
over their faces, so that they could not see the rifles pointed at them."
Then a group of soldiers took their stand opposite to each post.
"My
friend was the eighth on the list, and therefore he would have been
among the third lot to go up."
"A priest went about among them with a
cross: and there was about five minutes of time left for him to live."
"“He said that those five minutes seemed to him to be a most interminable
period, an enormous wealth of time; he seemed to be living, in these
minutes, so many lives that there was no need as yet to think of that
last moment, so that he made several arrangements, dividing up the time
into portions--one for saying farewell to his companions, two minutes
for that; then a couple more for thinking over his own life and career
and all about himself; and another minute for a last look around."
"He
remembered having divided his time like this quite well."
"While saying
good-bye to his friends he recollected asking one of them some very
usual everyday question, and being much interested in the answer."
"Then
having bade farewell, he embarked upon those two minutes which he had
allotted to looking into himself; he knew beforehand what he was going
to think about."
"He wished to put it to himself as quickly and clearly
as possible, that here was he, a living, thinking man, and that in three
minutes he would be nobody; or if somebody or something, then what and
where?"
"He thought he would decide this question once for all in these
last three minutes."
"A little way off there stood a church, and its
gilded spire glittered in the sun."
"He remembered staring stubbornly at
this spire, and at the rays of light sparkling from it."
"He could not
tear his eyes from these rays of light; he got the idea that these rays
were his new nature, and that in three minutes he would become one of
them, amalgamated somehow with them."
"“The repugnance to what must ensue almost immediately, and the
uncertainty, were dreadful, he said; but worst of all was the idea,
‘What should I do if I were not to die now?"
"What if I were to return to
life again?"
"What an eternity of days, and all mine!"
"How I should grudge
and count up every minute of it, so as to waste not a single instant!’
He said that this thought weighed so upon him and became such a terrible
burden upon his brain that he could not bear it, and wished they would
shoot him quickly and have done with it.”

The prince paused and all waited, expecting him to go on again and
finish the story."
“Is that all?” asked Aglaya.
“All?
"Yes,” said the prince, emerging from a momentary reverie."
"“And why did you tell us this?”

“Oh, I happened to recall it, that’s all!"
"It fitted into the
conversation--”

“You probably wish to deduce, prince,” said Alexandra, “that moments of
time cannot be reckoned by money value, and that sometimes five minutes
are worth priceless treasures."
"All this is very praiseworthy; but may I
ask about this friend of yours, who told you the terrible experience of
his life?"
"He was reprieved, you say; in other words, they did restore to
him that ‘eternity of days.’ What did he do with these riches of time?"
"Did he keep careful account of his minutes?”

“Oh no, he didn’t!"
I asked him myself.
"He said that he had not lived a
bit as he had intended, and had wasted many, and many a minute.”

“Very well, then there’s an experiment, and the thing is proved; one
cannot live and count each moment; say what you like, but one _cannot_.”

“That is true,” said the prince, “I have thought so myself."
"And yet, why
shouldn’t one do it?”

“You think, then, that you could live more wisely than other people?”
 said Aglaya."
"“I have had that idea.”

“And you have it still?”

“Yes--I have it still,” the prince replied."
"He had contemplated Aglaya until now, with a pleasant though rather
timid smile, but as the last words fell from his lips he began to laugh,
and looked at her merrily."
“You are not very modest!” said she.
“But how brave you are!” said he.
"“You are laughing, and I--that man’s
tale impressed me so much, that I dreamt of it afterwards; yes, I dreamt
of those five minutes...”

He looked at his listeners again with that same serious, searching
expression."
"“You are not angry with me?” he asked suddenly, and with a kind of
nervous hurry, although he looked them straight in the face."
“Why should we be angry?” they cried.
"“Only because I seem to be giving you a lecture, all the time!”

At this they laughed heartily."
"“Please don’t be angry with me,” continued the prince."
"“I know very well
that I have seen less of life than other people, and have less knowledge
of it."
"I must appear to speak strangely sometimes...”

He said the last words nervously."
"“You say you have been happy, and that proves you have lived, not less,
but more than other people."
"Why make all these excuses?” interrupted
Aglaya in a mocking tone of voice."
"“Besides, you need not mind about
lecturing us; you have nothing to boast of."
"With your quietism, one
could live happily for a hundred years at least."
"One might show you the
execution of a felon, or show you one’s little finger."
"You could draw
a moral from either, and be quite satisfied."
"That sort of existence is
easy enough.”

“I can’t understand why you always fly into a temper,” said Mrs.
Epanchin, who had been listening to the conversation and examining the
faces of the speakers in turn."
“I do not understand what you mean.
"What
has your little finger to do with it?"
"The prince talks well, though he
is not amusing."
"He began all right, but now he seems sad.”

“Never mind, mamma!"
"Prince, I wish you had seen an execution,” said
Aglaya."
"“I should like to ask you a question about that, if you had.”

“I have seen an execution,” said the prince."
“You have!” cried Aglaya.
“I might have guessed it.
"That’s a fitting
crown to the rest of the story."
"If you have seen an execution, how can
you say you lived happily all the while?”

“But is there capital punishment where you were?” asked Adelaida."
“I saw it at Lyons.
"Schneider took us there, and as soon as we arrived
we came in for that.”

“Well, and did you like it very much?"
"Was it very edifying and
instructive?” asked Aglaya."
"“No, I didn’t like it at all, and was ill after seeing it; but I confess
I stared as though my eyes were fixed to the sight."
"I could not tear
them away.”

“I, too, should have been unable to tear my eyes away,” said Aglaya."
“They do not at all approve of women going to see an execution there.
"The women who do go are condemned for it afterwards in the newspapers.”

“That is, by contending that it is not a sight for women they admit that
it is a sight for men."
I congratulate them on the deduction.
"I suppose
you quite agree with them, prince?”

“Tell us about the execution,” put in Adelaida."
"“I would much rather not, just now,” said the prince, a little disturbed
and frowning slightly."
"“You don’t seem to want to tell us,” said Aglaya, with a mocking air."
"“No,--the thing is, I was telling all about the execution a little while
ago, and--”

“Whom did you tell about it?”

“The man-servant, while I was waiting to see the general.”

“Our man-servant?” exclaimed several voices at once."
"“Yes, the one who waits in the entrance hall, a greyish, red-faced
man--”

“The prince is clearly a democrat,” remarked Aglaya."
"“Well, if you could tell Aleksey about it, surely you can tell us too.”

“I do so want to hear about it,” repeated Adelaida."
"“Just now, I confess,” began the prince, with more animation, “when you
asked me for a subject for a picture, I confess I had serious thoughts
of giving you one."
"I thought of asking you to draw the face of a
criminal, one minute before the fall of the guillotine, while the
wretched man is still standing on the scaffold, preparatory to placing
his neck on the block.”

“What, his face?"
only his face?” asked Adelaida.
"“That would be a
strange subject indeed."
"And what sort of a picture would that make?”

“Oh, why not?” the prince insisted, with some warmth."
"“When I was in
Basle I saw a picture very much in that style--I should like to tell you
about it; I will some time or other; it struck me very forcibly.”

“Oh, you shall tell us about the Basle picture another time; now we must
have all about the execution,” said Adelaida."
"“Tell us about that face
as it appeared to your imagination--how should it be drawn?--just the
face alone, do you mean?”

“It was just a minute before the execution,” began the prince, readily,
carried away by the recollection and evidently forgetting everything
else in a moment; “just at the instant when he stepped off the ladder on
to the scaffold."
"He happened to look in my direction: I saw his eyes and
understood all, at once--but how am I to describe it?"
"I do so wish you
or somebody else could draw it, you, if possible."
"I thought at the time
what a picture it would make."
"You must imagine all that went before, of
course, all--all."
"He had lived in the prison for some time and had not
expected that the execution would take place for at least a week yet--he
had counted on all the formalities and so on taking time; but it so
happened that his papers had been got ready quickly."
"At five o’clock in
the morning he was asleep--it was October, and at five in the morning
it was cold and dark."
"The governor of the prison comes in on tip-toe and
touches the sleeping man’s shoulder gently."
He starts up.
"‘What is it?’
he says."
"‘The execution is fixed for ten o’clock.’ He was only just
awake, and would not believe at first, but began to argue that his
papers would not be out for a week, and so on."
"When he was wide awake
and realized the truth, he became very silent and argued no more--so
they say; but after a bit he said: ‘It comes very hard on one so
suddenly’ and then he was silent again and said nothing."
"“The three or four hours went by, of course, in necessary
preparations--the priest, breakfast, (coffee, meat, and some wine they
gave him; doesn’t it seem ridiculous?)"
"And yet I believe these people
give them a good breakfast out of pure kindness of heart, and believe
that they are doing a good action."
"Then he is dressed, and then begins
the procession through the town to the scaffold."
"I think he, too,
must feel that he has an age to live still while they cart him along."
"Probably he thought, on the way, ‘Oh, I have a long, long time yet."
Three streets of life yet!
"When we’ve passed this street there’ll be
that other one; and then that one where the baker’s shop is on the
right; and when shall we get there?"
"It’s ages, ages!’ Around him are
crowds shouting, yelling--ten thousand faces, twenty thousand eyes."
"All this has to be endured, and especially the thought: ‘Here are ten
thousand men, and not one of them is going to be executed, and yet I am
to die.’ Well, all that is preparatory."
"“At the scaffold there is a ladder, and just there he burst into
tears--and this was a strong man, and a terribly wicked one, they say!"
"There was a priest with him the whole time, talking; even in the cart
as they drove along, he talked and talked."
"Probably the other heard
nothing; he would begin to listen now and then, and at the third word or
so he had forgotten all about it."
"“At last he began to mount the steps; his legs were tied, so that he had
to take very small steps."
"The priest, who seemed to be a wise man, had
stopped talking now, and only held the cross for the wretched fellow to
kiss."
"At the foot of the ladder he had been pale enough; but when he set
foot on the scaffold at the top, his face suddenly became the colour
of paper, positively like white notepaper."
"His legs must have become
suddenly feeble and helpless, and he felt a choking in his throat--you
know the sudden feeling one has in moments of terrible fear, when one
does not lose one’s wits, but is absolutely powerless to move?"
"If some
dreadful thing were suddenly to happen; if a house were just about to
fall on one;--don’t you know how one would long to sit down and shut
one’s eyes and wait, and wait?"
"Well, when this terrible feeling came
over him, the priest quickly pressed the cross to his lips, without a
word--a little silver cross it was--and he kept on pressing it to the
man’s lips every second."
"And whenever the cross touched his lips, the
eyes would open for a moment, and the legs moved once, and he kissed the
cross greedily, hurriedly--just as though he were anxious to catch hold
of something in case of its being useful to him afterwards, though he
could hardly have had any connected religious thoughts at the time."
"And
so up to the very block."
“How strange that criminals seldom swoon at such a moment!
"On
the contrary, the brain is especially active, and works
incessantly--probably hard, hard, hard--like an engine at full pressure."
"I imagine that various thoughts must beat loud and fast through
his head--all unfinished ones, and strange, funny thoughts, very
likely!--like this, for instance: ‘That man is looking at me, and he
has a wart on his forehead!"
"and the executioner has burst one of his
buttons, and the lowest one is all rusty!’ And meanwhile he notices and
remembers everything."
"There is one point that cannot be forgotten, round
which everything else dances and turns about; and because of this
point he cannot faint, and this lasts until the very final quarter of
a second, when the wretched neck is on the block and the victim listens
and waits and _knows_--that’s the point, he _knows_ that he is just _now_
about to die, and listens for the rasp of the iron over his head."
"If I
lay there, I should certainly listen for that grating sound, and hear
it, too!"
"There would probably be but the tenth part of an instant left
to hear it in, but one would certainly hear it."
"And imagine, some people
declare that when the head flies off it is _conscious_ of having flown
off!"
Just imagine what a thing to realize!
"Fancy if consciousness were
to last for even five seconds!"
"“Draw the scaffold so that only the top step of the ladder comes in
clearly."
"The criminal must be just stepping on to it, his face as white
as note-paper."
"The priest is holding the cross to his blue lips, and the
criminal kisses it, and knows and sees and understands everything."
"The cross and the head--there’s your picture; the priest and the
executioner, with his two assistants, and a few heads and eyes below."
Those might come in as subordinate accessories--a sort of mist.
"There’s
a picture for you.” The prince paused, and looked around."
"“Certainly that isn’t much like quietism,” murmured Alexandra, half to
herself."
"“Now tell us about your love affairs,” said Adelaida, after a moment’s
pause."
The prince gazed at her in amazement.
"“You know,” Adelaida continued, “you owe us a description of the Basle
picture; but first I wish to hear how you fell in love."
"Don’t deny the
fact, for you did, of course."
"Besides, you stop philosophizing when you
are telling about anything.”

“Why are you ashamed of your stories the moment after you have told
them?” asked Aglaya, suddenly."
"“How silly you are!” said Mrs. Epanchin, looking indignantly towards the
last speaker."
"“Yes, that wasn’t a clever remark,” said Alexandra."
"“Don’t listen to her, prince,” said Mrs. Epanchin; “she says that sort
of thing out of mischief."
"Don’t think anything of their nonsense, it
means nothing."
"They love to chaff, but they like you."
"I can see it in
their faces--I know their faces.”

“I know their faces, too,” said the prince, with a peculiar stress on
the words."
"“How so?” asked Adelaida, with curiosity."
"“What do _you_ know about our faces?” exclaimed the other two, in chorus."
But the prince was silent and serious.
All awaited his reply.
"“I’ll tell you afterwards,” he said quietly."
"“Ah, you want to arouse our curiosity!” said Aglaya."
"“And how terribly
solemn you are about it!”

“Very well,” interrupted Adelaida, “then if you can read faces so well,
you _must_ have been in love."
"Come now; I’ve guessed--let’s have the
secret!”

“I have not been in love,” said the prince, as quietly and seriously as
before."
"“I have been happy in another way.”

“How, how?”

“Well, I’ll tell you,” said the prince, apparently in a deep reverie."
VI.
"“Here you all are,” began the prince, “settling yourselves down to
listen to me with so much curiosity, that if I do not satisfy you you
will probably be angry with me."
"No, no!"
"I’m only joking!” he added,
hastily, with a smile."
"“Well, then--they were all children there, and I was always among
children and only with children."
"They were the children of the village
in which I lived, and they went to the school there--all of them."
"I did
not teach them, oh no; there was a master for that, one Jules Thibaut."
"I may have taught them some things, but I was among them just as an
outsider, and I passed all four years of my life there among them."
"I wished for nothing better; I used to tell them everything and hid
nothing from them."
"Their fathers and relations were very angry with me,
because the children could do nothing without me at last, and used to
throng after me at all times."
"The schoolmaster was my greatest enemy
in the end!"
"I had many enemies, and all because of the children."
"Even
Schneider reproached me."
What were they afraid of?
"One can tell a child
everything, anything."
"I have often been struck by the fact that parents
know their children so little."
"They should not conceal so much from
them."
"How well even little children understand that their parents
conceal things from them, because they consider them too young to
understand!"
"Children are capable of giving advice in the most important
matters."
"How can one deceive these dear little birds, when they look
at one so sweetly and confidingly?"
"I call them birds because there is
nothing in the world better than birds!"
"“However, most of the people were angry with me about one and the same
thing; but Thibaut simply was jealous of me."
"At first he had wagged his
head and wondered how it was that the children understood what I told
them so well, and could not learn from him; and he laughed like anything
when I replied that neither he nor I could teach them very much, but
that _they_ might teach us a good deal."
"“How he could hate me and tell scandalous stories about me, living among
children as he did, is what I cannot understand."
"Children soothe and
heal the wounded heart."
"I remember there was one poor fellow at our
professor’s who was being treated for madness, and you have no idea what
those children did for him, eventually."
"I don’t think he was mad, but
only terribly unhappy."
But I’ll tell you all about him another day.
"Now
I must get on with this story."
"“The children did not love me at first; I was such a sickly, awkward
kind of a fellow then--and I know I am ugly."
"Besides, I was a foreigner."
"The children used to laugh at me, at first; and they even went so far
as to throw stones at me, when they saw me kiss Marie."
"I only kissed her
once in my life--no, no, don’t laugh!” The prince hastened to suppress
the smiles of his audience at this point."
"“It was not a matter of _love_
at all!"
"If only you knew what a miserable creature she was, you would
have pitied her, just as I did."
She belonged to our village.
"Her mother
was an old, old woman, and they used to sell string and thread, and soap
and tobacco, out of the window of their little house, and lived on the
pittance they gained by this trade."
"The old woman was ill and very old,
and could hardly move."
"Marie was her daughter, a girl of twenty, weak
and thin and consumptive; but still she did heavy work at the houses
around, day by day."
"Well, one fine day a commercial traveller betrayed
her and carried her off; and a week later he deserted her."
"She came home
dirty, draggled, and shoeless; she had walked for a whole week without
shoes; she had slept in the fields, and caught a terrible cold; her feet
were swollen and sore, and her hands torn and scratched all over."
"She
never had been pretty even before; but her eyes were quiet, innocent,
kind eyes."
"“She was very quiet always--and I remember once, when she had suddenly
begun singing at her work, everyone said, ‘Marie tried to sing today!’
and she got so chaffed that she was silent for ever after."
"She had been
treated kindly in the place before; but when she came back now--ill and
shunned and miserable--not one of them all had the slightest sympathy
for her."
Cruel people!
"Oh, what hazy understandings they have on such
matters!"
Her mother was the first to show the way.
"She received her
wrathfully, unkindly, and with contempt."
"‘You have disgraced me,’ she
said."
"She was the first to cast her into ignominy; but when they all
heard that Marie had returned to the village, they ran out to see
her and crowded into the little cottage--old men, children, women,
girls--such a hurrying, stamping, greedy crowd."
"Marie was lying on
the floor at the old woman’s feet, hungry, torn, draggled, crying,
miserable."
"“When everyone crowded into the room she hid her face in her dishevelled
hair and lay cowering on the floor."
"Everyone looked at her as though she
were a piece of dirt off the road."
"The old men scolded and condemned,
and the young ones laughed at her."
"The women condemned her too, and
looked at her contemptuously, just as though she were some loathsome
insect."
"“Her mother allowed all this to go on, and nodded her head and
encouraged them."
"The old woman was very ill at that time, and knew she
was dying (she really did die a couple of months later), and though she
felt the end approaching she never thought of forgiving her daughter, to
the very day of her death."
She would not even speak to her.
"She made
her sleep on straw in a shed, and hardly gave her food enough to support
life."
"“Marie was very gentle to her mother, and nursed her, and did everything
for her; but the old woman accepted all her services without a word
and never showed her the slightest kindness."
"Marie bore all this; and
I could see when I got to know her that she thought it quite right and
fitting, considering herself the lowest and meanest of creatures."
"“When the old woman took to her bed finally, the other old women in the
village sat with her by turns, as the custom is there; and then Marie
was quite driven out of the house."
"They gave her no food at all, and she
could not get any work in the village; none would employ her."
"The men
seemed to consider her no longer a woman, they said such dreadful things
to her."
"Sometimes on Sundays, if they were drunk enough, they used to
throw her a penny or two, into the mud, and Marie would silently pick up
the money."
She had began to spit blood at that time.
"“At last her rags became so tattered and torn that she was ashamed of
appearing in the village any longer."
"The children used to pelt her with
mud; so she begged to be taken on as assistant cowherd, but the cowherd
would not have her."
"Then she took to helping him without leave; and he
saw how valuable her assistance was to him, and did not drive her away
again; on the contrary, he occasionally gave her the remnants of his
dinner, bread and cheese."
He considered that he was being very kind.
"When the mother died, the village parson was not ashamed to hold Marie
up to public derision and shame."
"Marie was standing at the coffin’s
head, in all her rags, crying."
“A crowd of people had collected to see how she would cry.
"The parson,
a young fellow ambitious of becoming a great preacher, began his sermon
and pointed to Marie."
"‘There,’ he said, ‘there is the cause of the death
of this venerable woman’--(which was a lie, because she had been ill for
at least two years)--‘there she stands before you, and dares not lift
her eyes from the ground, because she knows that the finger of God is
upon her."
"Look at her tatters and rags--the badge of those who lose
their virtue."
Who is she?
her daughter!’ and so on to the end.
"“And just fancy, this infamy pleased them, all of them, nearly."
"Only the
children had altered--for then they were all on my side and had learned
to love Marie."
"“This is how it was: I had wished to do something for Marie; I longed to
give her some money, but I never had a farthing while I was there."
"But
I had a little diamond pin, and this I sold to a travelling pedlar; he
gave me eight francs for it--it was worth at least forty."
"“I long sought to meet Marie alone; and at last I did meet her, on the
hillside beyond the village."
"I gave her the eight francs and asked her
to take care of the money because I could get no more; and then I kissed
her and said that she was not to suppose I kissed her with any evil
motives or because I was in love with her, for that I did so solely out
of pity for her, and because from the first I had not accounted her as
guilty so much as unfortunate."
"I longed to console and encourage her
somehow, and to assure her that she was not the low, base thing which
she and others strove to make out; but I don’t think she understood me."
"She stood before me, dreadfully ashamed of herself, and with downcast
eyes; and when I had finished she kissed my hand."
"I would have kissed
hers, but she drew it away."
"Just at this moment the whole troop of
children saw us."
"(I found out afterwards that they had long kept a
watch upon me.)"
"They all began whistling and clapping their hands, and
laughing at us."
"Marie ran away at once; and when I tried to talk to
them, they threw stones at me."
"All the village heard of it the same day,
and Marie’s position became worse than ever."
"The children would not let
her pass now in the streets, but annoyed her and threw dirt at her more
than before."
"They used to run after her--she racing away with her poor
feeble lungs panting and gasping, and they pelting her and shouting
abuse at her."
"“Once I had to interfere by force; and after that I took to speaking
to them every day and whenever I could."
"Occasionally they stopped and
listened; but they teased Marie all the same."
"“I told them how unhappy Marie was, and after a while they stopped their
abuse of her, and let her go by silently."
"Little by little we got into
the way of conversing together, the children and I. I concealed nothing
from them, I told them all."
"They listened very attentively and soon
began to be sorry for Marie."
"At last some of them took to saying
‘Good-morning’ to her, kindly, when they met her."
"It is the custom there
to salute anyone you meet with ‘Good-morning’ whether acquainted or not."
"I can imagine how astonished Marie was at these first greetings from the
children."
"“Once two little girls got hold of some food and took it to her, and
came back and told me."
"They said she had burst into tears, and that they
loved her very much now."
"Very soon after that they all became fond of
Marie, and at the same time they began to develop the greatest affection
for myself."
They often came to me and begged me to tell them stories.
"I
think I must have told stories well, for they did so love to hear them."
"At last I took to reading up interesting things on purpose to pass them
on to the little ones, and this went on for all the rest of my time
there, three years."
"Later, when everyone--even Schneider--was angry with
me for hiding nothing from the children, I pointed out how foolish it
was, for they always knew things, only they learnt them in a way that
soiled their minds but not so from me."
"One has only to remember one’s
own childhood to admit the truth of this."
But nobody was convinced...
"It
was two weeks before her mother died that I had kissed Marie; and when
the clergyman preached that sermon the children were all on my side."
"“When I told them what a shame it was of the parson to talk as he had
done, and explained my reason, they were so angry that some of them went
and broke his windows with stones."
"Of course I stopped them, for that
was not right, but all the village heard of it, and how I caught it for
spoiling the children!"
"Everyone discovered now that the little ones had
taken to being fond of Marie, and their parents were terribly alarmed;
but Marie was so happy."
"The children were forbidden to meet her; but
they used to run out of the village to the herd and take her food and
things; and sometimes just ran off there and kissed her, and said,
‘_Je vous aime, Marie!_’ and then trotted back again."
"They imagined
that I was in love with Marie, and this was the only point on which
I did not undeceive them, for they got such enjoyment out of it."
"And
what delicacy and tenderness they showed!"
“In the evening I used to walk to the waterfall.
"There was a spot there
which was quite closed in and hidden from view by large trees; and to
this spot the children used to come to me."
"They could not bear that
their dear Leon should love a poor girl without shoes to her feet and
dressed all in rags and tatters."
"So, would you believe it, they actually
clubbed together, somehow, and bought her shoes and stockings, and some
linen, and even a dress!"
"I can’t understand how they managed it, but
they did it, all together."
"When I asked them about it they only laughed
and shouted, and the little girls clapped their hands and kissed me."
"I
sometimes went to see Marie secretly, too."
"She had become very ill, and
could hardly walk."
"She still went with the herd, but could not help the
herdsman any longer."
"She used to sit on a stone near, and wait there
almost motionless all day, till the herd went home."
"Her consumption was
so advanced, and she was so weak, that she used to sit with closed eyes,
breathing heavily."
"Her face was as thin as a skeleton’s, and sweat used
to stand on her white brow in large drops."
"I always found her sitting
just like that."
"I used to come up quietly to look at her; but Marie
would hear me, open her eyes, and tremble violently as she kissed my
hands."
"I did not take my hand away because it made her happy to have it,
and so she would sit and cry quietly."
"Sometimes she tried to speak; but
it was very difficult to understand her."
"She was almost like a madwoman,
with excitement and ecstasy, whenever I came."
"Occasionally the children
came with me; when they did so, they would stand some way off and keep
guard over us, so as to tell me if anybody came near."
"This was a great
pleasure to them."
"“When we left her, Marie used to relapse at once into her old condition,
and sit with closed eyes and motionless limbs."
"One day she could not
go out at all, and remained at home all alone in the empty hut; but
the children very soon became aware of the fact, and nearly all of them
visited her that day as she lay alone and helpless in her miserable bed."
"“For two days the children looked after her, and then, when the village
people got to know that Marie was really dying, some of the old women
came and took it in turns to sit by her and look after her a bit."
"I
think they began to be a little sorry for her in the village at last;
at all events they did not interfere with the children any more, on her
account."
"“Marie lay in a state of uncomfortable delirium the whole while; she
coughed dreadfully."
"The old women would not let the children stay in the
room; but they all collected outside the window each morning, if only
for a moment, and shouted ‘_Bon jour, notre bonne Marie!_’ and Marie no
sooner caught sight of, or heard them, and she became quite animated at
once, and, in spite of the old women, would try to sit up and nod her
head and smile at them, and thank them."
"The little ones used to bring
her nice things and sweets to eat, but she could hardly touch anything."
"Thanks to them, I assure you, the girl died almost perfectly happy."
"She
almost forgot her misery, and seemed to accept their love as a sort of
symbol of pardon for her offence, though she never ceased to consider
herself a dreadful sinner."
"They used to flutter at her window just like
little birds, calling out: ‘_Nous t’aimons, Marie!_’

“She died very soon; I had thought she would live much longer."
"The
day before her death I went to see her for the last time, just before
sunset."
"I think she recognized me, for she pressed my hand."
“Next morning they came and told me that Marie was dead.
"The children
could not be restrained now; they went and covered her coffin with
flowers, and put a wreath of lovely blossoms on her head."
"The pastor did
not throw any more shameful words at the poor dead woman; but there were
very few people at the funeral."
"However, when it came to carrying the
coffin, all the children rushed up, to carry it themselves."
"Of course
they could not do it alone, but they insisted on helping, and walked
alongside and behind, crying."
"“They have planted roses all round her grave, and every year they look
after the flowers and make Marie’s resting-place as beautiful as they
can."
"I was in ill odour after all this with the parents of the children,
and especially with the parson and schoolmaster."
"Schneider was obliged
to promise that I should not meet them and talk to them; but we
conversed from a distance by signs, and they used to write me sweet
little notes."
"Afterwards I came closer than ever to those little souls,
but even then it was very dear to me, to have them so fond of me."
"“Schneider said that I did the children great harm by my pernicious
‘system’; what nonsense that was!"
And what did he mean by my system?
"He said afterwards that he believed I was a child myself--just before
I came away."
"‘You have the form and face of an adult’ he said, ‘but as
regards soul, and character, and perhaps even intelligence, you are a
child in the completest sense of the word, and always will be, if you
live to be sixty.’ I laughed very much, for of course that is nonsense."
"But it is a fact that I do not care to be among grown-up people and
much prefer the society of children."
"However kind people may be to me, I
never feel quite at home with them, and am always glad to get back to
my little companions."
"Now my companions have always been children, not
because I was a child myself once, but because young things attract
me."
"On one of the first days of my stay in Switzerland, I was strolling
about alone and miserable, when I came upon the children rushing noisily
out of school, with their slates and bags, and books, their games, their
laughter and shouts--and my soul went out to them."
"I stopped and laughed
happily as I watched their little feet moving so quickly."
"Girls and
boys, laughing and crying; for as they went home many of them found
time to fight and make peace, to weep and play."
"I forgot my troubles in
looking at them."
"And then, all those three years, I tried to understand
why men should be for ever tormenting themselves."
"I lived the life of
a child there, and thought I should never leave the little village;
indeed, I was far from thinking that I should ever return to Russia."
"But at last I recognized the fact that Schneider could not keep me any
longer."
"And then something so important happened, that Schneider himself
urged me to depart."
"I am going to see now if can get good advice
about it."
"Perhaps my lot in life will be changed; but that is not the
principal thing."
"The principal thing is the entire change that has
already come over me."
I left many things behind me--too many.
"They have
gone."
"On the journey I said to myself, ‘I am going into the world of
men."
"I don’t know much, perhaps, but a new life has begun for me.’ I
made up my mind to be honest, and steadfast in accomplishing my task."
"Perhaps I shall meet with troubles and many disappointments, but I have
made up my mind to be polite and sincere to everyone; more cannot be
asked of me."
People may consider me a child if they like.
"I am often
called an idiot, and at one time I certainly was so ill that I was
nearly as bad as an idiot; but I am not an idiot now."
"How can I possibly
be so when I know myself that I am considered one?"
"“When I received a letter from those dear little souls, while passing
through Berlin, I only then realized how much I loved them."
"It was very,
very painful, getting that first little letter."
"How melancholy they had
been when they saw me off!"
"For a month before, they had been talking of
my departure and sorrowing over it; and at the waterfall, of an evening,
when we parted for the night, they would hug me so tight and kiss me so
warmly, far more so than before."
"And every now and then they would turn
up one by one when I was alone, just to give me a kiss and a hug, to
show their love for me."
"The whole flock went with me to the station,
which was about a mile from the village, and every now and then one of
them would stop to throw his arms round me, and all the little girls had
tears in their voices, though they tried hard not to cry."
"As the train
steamed out of the station, I saw them all standing on the platform
waving to me and crying ‘Hurrah!’ till they were lost in the distance."
"“I assure you, when I came in here just now and saw your kind faces (I
can read faces well) my heart felt light for the first time since that
moment of parting."
"I think I must be one of those who are born to be in
luck, for one does not often meet with people whom one feels he can love
from the first sight of their faces; and yet, no sooner do I step out of
the railway carriage than I happen upon you!"
"“I know it is more or less a shamefaced thing to speak of one’s feelings
before others; and yet here am I talking like this to you, and am not
a bit ashamed or shy."
"I am an unsociable sort of fellow and shall very
likely not come to see you again for some time; but don’t think the
worse of me for that."
"It is not that I do not value your society; and
you must never suppose that I have taken offence at anything."
"“You asked me about your faces, and what I could read in them; I will
tell you with the greatest pleasure."
"You, Adelaida Ivanovna, have a very
happy face; it is the most sympathetic of the three."
"Not to speak of
your natural beauty, one can look at your face and say to one’s self,
‘She has the face of a kind sister.’ You are simple and merry, but you
can see into another’s heart very quickly."
"That’s what I read in your
face."
"“You too, Alexandra Ivanovna, have a very lovely face; but I think you
may have some secret sorrow."
"Your heart is undoubtedly a kind, good one,
but you are not merry."
"There is a certain suspicion of ‘shadow’ in your
face, like in that of Holbein’s Madonna in Dresden."
"So much for your
face."
Have I guessed right?
"“As for your face, Lizabetha Prokofievna, I not only think, but am
perfectly _sure_, that you are an absolute child--in all, in all, mind,
both good and bad--and in spite of your years."
"Don’t be angry with me
for saying so; you know what my feelings for children are."
"And do not
suppose that I am so candid out of pure simplicity of soul."
"Oh dear no,
it is by no means the case!"
"Perhaps I have my own very profound object
in view.”

VII."
"When the prince ceased speaking all were gazing merrily at him--even
Aglaya; but Lizabetha Prokofievna looked the jolliest of all."
"“Well!” she cried, “we _have_ ‘put him through his paces,’ with a
vengeance!"
"My dears, you imagined, I believe, that you were about
to patronize this young gentleman, like some poor _protégé_ picked up
somewhere, and taken under your magnificent protection."
"What fools we
were, and what a specially big fool is your father!"
"Well done, prince!"
"I
assure you the general actually asked me to put you through your paces,
and examine you."
"As to what you said about my face, you are absolutely
correct in your judgment."
"I am a child, and know it."
"I knew it long
before you said so; you have expressed my own thoughts."
"I think your
nature and mine must be extremely alike, and I am very glad of it."
"We
are like two drops of water, only you are a man and I a woman, and I’ve
not been to Switzerland, and that is all the difference between us.”

“Don’t be in a hurry, mother; the prince says that he has some motive
behind his simplicity,” cried Aglaya."
"“Yes, yes, so he does,” laughed the others."
"“Oh, don’t you begin bantering him,” said mamma."
"“He is probably a good
deal cleverer than all three of you girls put together."
We shall see.
"Only you haven’t told us anything about Aglaya yet, prince; and Aglaya
and I are both waiting to hear.”

“I cannot say anything at present."
"I’ll tell you afterwards.”

“Why?"
"Her face is clear enough, isn’t it?”

“Oh yes, of course."
"You are very beautiful, Aglaya Ivanovna, so
beautiful that one is afraid to look at you.”

“Is that all?"
What about her character?” persisted Mrs. Epanchin.
“It is difficult to judge when such beauty is concerned.
"I have not
prepared my judgment."
"Beauty is a riddle.”

“That means that you have set Aglaya a riddle!” said Adelaida."
"“Guess
it, Aglaya!"
"But she’s pretty, prince, isn’t she?”

“Most wonderfully so,” said the latter, warmly, gazing at Aglaya with
admiration."
"“Almost as lovely as Nastasia Philipovna, but quite a
different type.”

All present exchanged looks of surprise."
“As lovely as _who?_” said Mrs. Epanchin.
"“As _Nastasia Philipovna?_
Where have you seen Nastasia Philipovna?"
"What Nastasia Philipovna?”

“Gavrila Ardalionovitch showed the general her portrait just now.”

“How so?"
"Did he bring the portrait for my husband?”

“Only to show it."
"Nastasia Philipovna gave it to Gavrila Ardalionovitch
today, and the latter brought it here to show to the general.”

“I must see it!” cried Mrs. Epanchin."
“Where is the portrait?
"If she
gave it to him, he must have it; and he is still in the study."
"He
never leaves before four o’clock on Wednesdays."
"Send for Gavrila
Ardalionovitch at once."
"No, I don’t long to see _him_ so much."
"Look here,
dear prince, _be_ so kind, will you?"
"Just step to the study and fetch this
portrait!"
Say we want to look at it.
"Please do this for me, will you?”

“He is a nice fellow, but a little too simple,” said Adelaida, as the
prince left the room."
"“He is, indeed,” said Alexandra; “almost laughably so at times.”

Neither one nor the other seemed to give expression to her full
thoughts."
"“He got out of it very neatly about our faces, though,” said Aglaya."
"“He
flattered us all round, even mamma.”

“Nonsense!” cried the latter."
“He did not flatter me.
"It was I who found
his appreciation flattering."
"I think you are a great deal more foolish
than he is."
"He is simple, of course, but also very knowing."
"Just like
myself.”

“How stupid of me to speak of the portrait,” thought the prince as
he entered the study, with a feeling of guilt at his heart, “and yet,
perhaps I was right after all.” He had an idea, unformed as yet, but a
strange idea."
"Gavrila Ardalionovitch was still sitting in the study, buried in a
mass of papers."
"He looked as though he did not take his salary from the
public company, whose servant he was, for a sinecure."
"He grew very wroth and confused when the prince asked for the portrait,
and explained how it came about that he had spoken of it."
"“Oh, curse it all,” he said; “what on earth must you go blabbing for?"
"You know nothing about the thing, and yet--idiot!” he added, muttering
the last word to himself in irrepressible rage."
“I am very sorry; I was not thinking at the time.
"I merely said that
Aglaya was almost as beautiful as Nastasia Philipovna.”

Gania asked for further details; and the prince once more repeated the
conversation."
Gania looked at him with ironical contempt the while.
"“Nastasia Philipovna,” he began, and there paused; he was clearly much
agitated and annoyed."
The prince reminded him of the portrait.
"“Listen, prince,” said Gania, as though an idea had just struck him, “I
wish to ask you a great favour, and yet I really don’t know--”

He paused again, he was trying to make up his mind to something, and
was turning the matter over."
The prince waited quietly.
"Once more Gania
fixed him with intent and questioning eyes."
"“Prince,” he began again, “they are rather angry with me, in there,
owing to a circumstance which I need not explain, so that I do not care
to go in at present without an invitation."
"I particularly wish to speak
to Aglaya, but I have written a few words in case I shall not have the
chance of seeing her” (here the prince observed a small note in his
hand), “and I do not know how to get my communication to her."
"Don’t you
think you could undertake to give it to her at once, but only to her,
mind, and so that no one else should see you give it?"
"It isn’t much of a
secret, but still--Well, will you do it?”

“I don’t quite like it,” replied the prince."
"“Oh, but it is absolutely necessary for me,” Gania entreated."
"“Believe
me, if it were not so, I would not ask you; how else am I to get it to
her?"
"It is most important, dreadfully important!”

Gania was evidently much alarmed at the idea that the prince would not
consent to take his note, and he looked at him now with an expression of
absolute entreaty."
"“Well, I will take it then.”

“But mind, nobody is to see!” cried the delighted Gania “And of course I
may rely on your word of honour, eh?”

“I won’t show it to anyone,” said the prince."
"“The letter is not sealed--” continued Gania, and paused in confusion."
"“Oh, I won’t read it,” said the prince, quite simply."
"He took up the portrait, and went out of the room."
"Gania, left alone, clutched his head with his hands."
"“One word from her,” he said, “one word from her, and I may yet be
free.”

He could not settle himself to his papers again, for agitation and
excitement, but began walking up and down the room from corner to
corner."
"The prince walked along, musing."
"He did not like his commission, and
disliked the idea of Gania sending a note to Aglaya at all; but when
he was two rooms distant from the drawing-room, where they all were,
he stopped as though recalling something; went to the window, nearer the
light, and began to examine the portrait in his hand."
"He longed to solve the mystery of something in the face of Nastasia
Philipovna, something which had struck him as he looked at the portrait
for the first time; the impression had not left him."
"It was partly the
fact of her marvellous beauty that struck him, and partly something
else."
"There was a suggestion of immense pride and disdain in the face
almost of hatred, and at the same time something confiding and very full
of simplicity."
"The contrast aroused a deep sympathy in his heart as
he looked at the lovely face."
"The blinding loveliness of it was almost
intolerable, this pale thin face with its flaming eyes; it was a strange
beauty."
"The prince gazed at it for a minute or two, then glanced around him,
and hurriedly raised the portrait to his lips."
"When, a minute after, he
reached the drawing-room door, his face was quite composed."
"But just as
he reached the door he met Aglaya coming out alone."
"“Gavrila Ardalionovitch begged me to give you this,” he said, handing
her the note."
"Aglaya stopped, took the letter, and gazed strangely into the prince’s
eyes."
"There was no confusion in her face; a little surprise, perhaps,
but that was all."
"By her look she seemed merely to challenge the prince
to an explanation as to how he and Gania happened to be connected in
this matter."
"But her expression was perfectly cool and quiet, and even
condescending."
"So they stood for a moment or two, confronting one another."
"At length a
faint smile passed over her face, and she passed by him without a word."
"Mrs. Epanchin examined the portrait of Nastasia Philipovna for some
little while, holding it critically at arm’s length."
"“Yes, she is pretty,” she said at last, “even very pretty."
"I have seen
her twice, but only at a distance."
"So you admire this kind of beauty, do
you?” she asked the prince, suddenly."
"“Yes, I do--this kind.”

“Do you mean especially this kind?”

“Yes, especially this kind.”

“Why?”

“There is much suffering in this face,” murmured the prince, more as
though talking to himself than answering the question."
"“I think you are wandering a little, prince,” Mrs. Epanchin decided,
after a lengthened survey of his face; and she tossed the portrait on to
the table, haughtily."
"Alexandra took it, and Adelaida came up, and both the girls examined the
photograph."
Just then Aglaya entered the room.
"“What a power!” cried Adelaida suddenly, as she earnestly examined the
portrait over her sister’s shoulder."
“Whom?
"What power?” asked her mother, crossly."
"“Such beauty is real power,” said Adelaida."
"“With such beauty as that
one might overthrow the world.” She returned to her easel thoughtfully."
"Aglaya merely glanced at the portrait--frowned, and put out her
underlip; then went and sat down on the sofa with folded hands."
"Mrs.
Epanchin rang the bell."
"“Ask Gavrila Ardalionovitch to step this way,” said she to the man who
answered."
"“Mamma!” cried Alexandra, significantly."
"“I shall just say two words to him, that’s all,” said her mother,
silencing all objection by her manner; she was evidently seriously put
out."
"“You see, prince, it is all secrets with us, just now--all secrets."
"It seems to be the etiquette of the house, for some reason or other."
"Stupid nonsense, and in a matter which ought to be approached with all
candour and open-heartedness."
"There is a marriage being talked of, and I
don’t like this marriage--”

“Mamma, what are you saying?” said Alexandra again, hurriedly."
"“Well, what, my dear girl?"
As if you can possibly like it yourself?
"The
heart is the great thing, and the rest is all rubbish--though one must
have sense as well."
Perhaps sense is really the great thing.
"Don’t smile
like that, Aglaya."
I don’t contradict myself.
"A fool with a heart and no
brains is just as unhappy as a fool with brains and no heart."
"I am one
and you are the other, and therefore both of us suffer, both of us are
unhappy.”

“Why are you so unhappy, mother?” asked Adelaida, who alone of all the
company seemed to have preserved her good temper and spirits up to now."
"“In the first place, because of my carefully brought-up daughters,” said
Mrs. Epanchin, cuttingly; “and as that is the best reason I can give you
we need not bother about any other at present."
"Enough of words, now!"
"We shall see how both of you (I don’t count Aglaya) will manage your
business, and whether you, most revered Alexandra Ivanovna, will be
happy with your fine mate.”

“Ah!” she added, as Gania suddenly entered the room, “here’s another
marrying subject."
"How do you do?” she continued, in response to Gania’s
bow; but she did not invite him to sit down."
"“You are going to be
married?”

“Married?"
"how--what marriage?” murmured Gania, overwhelmed with
confusion."
“Are you about to take a wife?
"I ask,--if you prefer that expression.”

“No, no I--I--no!” said Gania, bringing out his lie with a tell-tale
blush of shame."
"He glanced keenly at Aglaya, who was sitting some way
off, and dropped his eyes immediately."
"Aglaya gazed coldly, intently, and composedly at him, without taking her
eyes off his face, and watched his confusion."
“No?
"You say no, do you?” continued the pitiless Mrs. General."
"“Very
well, I shall remember that you told me this Wednesday morning, in
answer to my question, that you are not going to be married."
"What day is
it, Wednesday, isn’t it?”

“Yes, I think so!” said Adelaida."
"“You never know the day of the week; what’s the day of the month?”

“Twenty-seventh!” said Gania."
“Twenty-seventh; very well.
"Good-bye now; you have a good deal to do,
I’m sure, and I must dress and go out."
Take your portrait.
"Give my
respects to your unfortunate mother, Nina Alexandrovna."
"_Au revoir_, dear
prince, come in and see us often, do; and I shall tell old Princess
Bielokonski about you."
I shall go and see her on purpose.
"And listen,
my dear boy, I feel sure that God has sent you to Petersburg from
Switzerland on purpose for me."
"Maybe you will have other things to do,
besides, but you are sent chiefly for my sake, I feel sure of it."
"God
sent you to me!"
Au revoir!
"Alexandra, come with me, my dear.”

Mrs. Epanchin left the room."
"Gania--confused, annoyed, furious--took up his portrait, and turned to
the prince with a nasty smile on his face."
"“Prince,” he said, “I am just going home."
"If you have not changed your
mind as to living with us, perhaps you would like to come with me."
"You
don’t know the address, I believe?”

“Wait a minute, prince,” said Aglaya, suddenly rising from her seat, “do
write something in my album first, will you?"
"Father says you are a most
talented caligraphist; I’ll bring you my book in a minute.” She left the
room."
"“Well, _au revoir_, prince,” said Adelaida, “I must be going too.” She
pressed the prince’s hand warmly, and gave him a friendly smile as she
left the room."
She did not so much as look at Gania.
"“This is your doing, prince,” said Gania, turning on the latter so soon
as the others were all out of the room."
"“This is your doing, sir!"
"_You_
have been telling them that I am going to be married!” He said this in
a hurried whisper, his eyes flashing with rage and his face ablaze."
"“You
shameless tattler!”

“I assure you, you are under a delusion,” said the prince, calmly and
politely."
"“I did not even know that you were to be married.”

“You heard me talking about it, the general and me."
"You heard me say
that everything was to be settled today at Nastasia Philipovna’s, and
you went and blurted it out here."
You lie if you deny it.
"Who else
could have told them?"
"Devil take it, sir, who could have told them except
yourself?"
"Didn’t the old woman as good as hint as much to me?”

“If she hinted to you who told her you must know best, of course; but I
never said a word about it.”

“Did you give my note?"
"Is there an answer?” interrupted Gania,
impatiently."
"But at this moment Aglaya came back, and the prince had no time to
reply."
"“There, prince,” said she, “there’s my album."
"Now choose a page and
write me something, will you?"
"There’s a pen, a new one; do you mind a
steel one?"
"I have heard that you caligraphists don’t like steel pens.”

Conversing with the prince, Aglaya did not even seem to notice that
Gania was in the room."
"But while the prince was getting his pen ready,
finding a page, and making his preparations to write, Gania came up to
the fireplace where Aglaya was standing, to the right of the prince, and
in trembling, broken accents said, almost in her ear:

“One word, just one word from you, and I’m saved.”

The prince turned sharply round and looked at both of them."
"Gania’s
face was full of real despair; he seemed to have said the words almost
unconsciously and on the impulse of the moment."
"Aglaya gazed at him for some seconds with precisely the same composure
and calm astonishment as she had shown a little while before, when the
prince handed her the note, and it appeared that this calm surprise and
seemingly absolute incomprehension of what was said to her, were more
terribly overwhelming to Gania than even the most plainly expressed
disdain would have been."
“What shall I write?” asked the prince.
"“I’ll dictate to you,” said Aglaya, coming up to the table."
"“Now then,
are you ready?"
"Write, ‘I never condescend to bargain!’ Now put your name
and the date."
"Let me see it.”

The prince handed her the album."
“Capital!
How beautifully you have written it!
Thanks so much.
"_Au
revoir_, prince."
"Wait a minute,” she added, “I want to give you
something for a keepsake."
"Come with me this way, will you?”

The prince followed her."
"Arrived at the dining-room, she stopped."
"“Read this,” she said, handing him Gania’s note."
"The prince took it from her hand, but gazed at her in bewilderment."
“Oh!
"I _know_ you haven’t read it, and that you could never be that
man’s accomplice."
"Read it, I wish you to read it.”

The letter had evidently been written in a hurry:

“My fate is to be decided today” (it ran), “you know how."
"This day I
must give my word irrevocably."
"I have no right to ask your help, and I
dare not allow myself to indulge in any hopes; but once you said just
one word, and that word lighted up the night of my life, and became the
beacon of my days."
"Say one more such word, and save me from utter ruin."
"Only tell me, ‘break off the whole thing!’ and I will do so this very
day."
Oh!
what can it cost you to say just this one word?
"In doing so you
will but be giving me a sign of your sympathy for me, and of your pity;
only this, only this; nothing more, _nothing_."
"I dare not indulge in any
hope, because I am unworthy of it."
"But if you say but this word, I will
take up my cross again with joy, and return once more to my battle with
poverty."
"I shall meet the storm and be glad of it; I shall rise up with
renewed strength."
"“Send me back then this one word of sympathy, only sympathy, I swear
to you; and oh!"
"do not be angry with the audacity of despair, with the
drowning man who has dared to make this last effort to save himself from
perishing beneath the waters."
"“G.L.”

“This man assures me,” said Aglaya, scornfully, when the prince had
finished reading the letter, “that the words ‘break off everything’
do not commit me to anything whatever; and himself gives me a written
guarantee to that effect, in this letter."
"Observe how ingenuously he
underlines certain words, and how crudely he glosses over his hidden
thoughts."
"He must know that if he ‘broke off everything,’ _first_, by
himself, and without telling me a word about it or having the slightest
hope on my account, that in that case I should perhaps be able to change
my opinion of him, and even accept his--friendship."
"He must know that,
but his soul is such a wretched thing."
"He knows it and cannot make
up his mind; he knows it and yet asks for guarantees."
"He cannot bring
himself to _trust_, he wants me to give him hopes of myself before he lets
go of his hundred thousand roubles."
"As to the ‘former word’ which he
declares ‘lighted up the night of his life,’ he is simply an impudent
liar; I merely pitied him once."
But he is audacious and shameless.
"He
immediately began to hope, at that very moment."
I saw it.
"He has tried
to catch me ever since; he is still fishing for me."
"Well, enough of
this."
"Take the letter and give it back to him, as soon as you have left
our house; not before, of course.”

“And what shall I tell him by way of answer?”

“Nothing--of course!"
That’s the best answer.
"Is it the case that you are
going to live in his house?”

“Yes, your father kindly recommended me to him.”

“Then look out for him, I warn you!"
"He won’t forgive you easily, for
taking back the letter.”

Aglaya pressed the prince’s hand and left the room."
"Her face was serious
and frowning; she did not even smile as she nodded good-bye to him at
the door."
"“I’ll just get my parcel and we’ll go,” said the prince to Gania, as he
re-entered the drawing-room."
Gania stamped his foot with impatience.
"His
face looked dark and gloomy with rage."
"At last they left the house behind them, the prince carrying his bundle."
"“The answer--quick--the answer!” said Gania, the instant they were
outside."
“What did she say?
"Did you give the letter?” The prince
silently held out the note."
Gania was struck motionless with amazement.
"“How, what?"
my letter?” he cried.
“He never delivered it!
"I might have
guessed it, oh!"
curse him!
"Of course she did not understand what I
meant, naturally!"
"Why--why--_why_ didn’t you give her the note, you--”

“Excuse me; I was able to deliver it almost immediately after receiving
your commission, and I gave it, too, just as you asked me to."
"It has
come into my hands now because Aglaya Ivanovna has just returned it to
me.”

“How?"
"When?”

“As soon as I finished writing in her album for her, and when she asked
me to come out of the room with her (you heard?"
"), we went into the
dining-room, and she gave me your letter to read, and then told me to
return it.”

“To _read?_” cried Gania, almost at the top of his voice; “to _read_,
and you read it?”

And again he stood like a log in the middle of the pavement; so amazed
that his mouth remained open after the last word had left it."
"“Yes, I have just read it.”

“And she gave it you to read herself--_herself?_”

“Yes, herself; and you may believe me when I tell you that I would not
have read it for anything without her permission.”

Gania was silent for a minute or two, as though thinking out some
problem."
"Suddenly he cried:

“It’s impossible, she cannot have given it to you to read!"
"You are
lying."
"You read it yourself!”

“I am telling you the truth,” said the prince in his former composed
tone of voice; “and believe me, I am extremely sorry that the
circumstance should have made such an unpleasant impression upon you!”

“But, you wretched man, at least she must have said something?"
"There
must be _some_ answer from her!”

“Yes, of course, she did say something!”

“Out with it then, damn it!"
"Out with it at once!” and Gania stamped his
foot twice on the pavement."
"“As soon as I had finished reading it, she told me that you were fishing
for her; that you wished to compromise her so far as to receive some
hopes from her, trusting to which hopes you might break with the
prospect of receiving a hundred thousand roubles."
"She said that if you
had done this without bargaining with her, if you had broken with the
money prospects without trying to force a guarantee out of her first,
she might have been your friend."
"That’s all, I think."
"Oh no, when I
asked her what I was to say, as I took the letter, she replied that ‘no
answer is the best answer.’ I think that was it."
"Forgive me if I do
not use her exact expressions."
"I tell you the sense as I understood it
myself.”

Ungovernable rage and madness took entire possession of Gania, and his
fury burst out without the least attempt at restraint."
“Oh!
"that’s it, is it!” he yelled."
"“She throws my letters out of the
window, does she!"
Oh!
"and she does not condescend to bargain, while I
_do_, eh?"
"We shall see, we shall see!"
"I shall pay her out for this.”

He twisted himself about with rage, and grew paler and paler; he shook
his fist."
So the pair walked along a few steps.
"Gania did not stand on
ceremony with the prince; he behaved just as though he were alone in
his room."
He clearly counted the latter as a nonentity.
"But suddenly he
seemed to have an idea, and recollected himself."
"“But how was it?” he asked, “how was it that you (idiot that you are),”
 he added to himself, “were so very confidential a couple of hours after
your first meeting with these people?"
"How was that, eh?”

Up to this moment jealousy had not been one of his torments; now it
suddenly gnawed at his heart."
"“That is a thing I cannot undertake to explain,” replied the prince."
Gania looked at him with angry contempt.
“Oh!
"I suppose the present she wished to make to you, when she took you
into the dining-room, was her confidence, eh?”

“I suppose that was it; I cannot explain it otherwise.”

“But why, _why?_ Devil take it, what did you do in there?"
"Why did they
fancy you?"
"Look here, can’t you remember exactly what you said to them,
from the very beginning?"
"Can’t you remember?”

“Oh, we talked of a great many things."
"When first I went in we began to
speak of Switzerland.”

“Oh, the devil take Switzerland!”

“Then about executions.”

“Executions?”

“Yes--at least about one."
"Then I told the whole three years’ story of my
life, and the history of a poor peasant girl--”

“Oh, damn the peasant girl!"
"go on, go on!” said Gania, impatiently."
"“Then how Schneider told me about my childish nature, and--”

“Oh, _curse_ Schneider and his dirty opinions!"
"Go on.”

“Then I began to talk about faces, at least about the _expressions_ of
faces, and said that Aglaya Ivanovna was nearly as lovely as Nastasia
Philipovna."
"It was then I blurted out about the portrait--”

“But you didn’t repeat what you heard in the study?"
"You didn’t repeat
that--eh?”

“No, I tell you I did _not_.”

“Then how did they--look here!"
"Did Aglaya show my letter to the old
lady?”

“Oh, there I can give you my fullest assurance that she did _not_."
"I was
there all the while--she had no time to do it!”

“But perhaps you may not have observed it, oh, you damned idiot, you!”
 he shouted, quite beside himself with fury."
"“You can’t even describe
what went on.”

Gania having once descended to abuse, and receiving no check, very soon
knew no bounds or limit to his licence, as is often the way in such
cases."
"His rage so blinded him that he had not even been able to detect
that this “idiot,” whom he was abusing to such an extent, was very
far from being slow of comprehension, and had a way of taking in
an impression, and afterwards giving it out again, which was very
un-idiotic indeed."
But something a little unforeseen now occurred.
"“I think I ought to tell you, Gavrila Ardalionovitch,” said the prince,
suddenly, “that though I once was so ill that I really was little better
than an idiot, yet now I am almost recovered, and that, therefore, it is
not altogether pleasant to be called an idiot to my face."
"Of course your
anger is excusable, considering the treatment you have just experienced;
but I must remind you that you have twice abused me rather rudely."
"I
do not like this sort of thing, and especially so at the first time
of meeting a man, and, therefore, as we happen to be at this moment
standing at a crossroad, don’t you think we had better part, you to the
left, homewards, and I to the right, here?"
"I have twenty-five roubles,
and I shall easily find a lodging.”

Gania was much confused, and blushed for shame “Do forgive me, prince!”
 he cried, suddenly changing his abusive tone for one of great courtesy."
"“For Heaven’s sake, forgive me!"
"You see what a miserable plight I am
in, but you hardly know anything of the facts of the case as yet."
"If you
did, I am sure you would forgive me, at least partially."
"Of course it
was inexcusable of me, I know, but--”

“Oh, dear me, I really do not require such profuse apologies,” replied
the prince, hastily."
"“I quite understand how unpleasant your position
is, and that is what made you abuse me."
"So come along to your house,
after all."
"I shall be delighted--”

“I am not going to let him go like this,” thought Gania, glancing
angrily at the prince as they walked along."
"“The fellow has sucked
everything out of me, and now he takes off his mask--there’s something
more than appears, here we shall see."
"It shall all be as clear as water
by tonight, everything!”

But by this time they had reached Gania’s house."
VIII.
"The flat occupied by Gania and his family was on the third floor of the
house."
"It was reached by a clean light staircase, and consisted of seven
rooms, a nice enough lodging, and one would have thought a little too
good for a clerk on two thousand roubles a year."
"But it was designed
to accommodate a few lodgers on board terms, and had been taken a few
months since, much to the disgust of Gania, at the urgent request of his
mother and his sister, Varvara Ardalionovna, who longed to do something
to increase the family income a little, and fixed their hopes upon
letting lodgings."
Gania frowned upon the idea.
"He thought it _infra dig_,
and did not quite like appearing in society afterwards--that society in
which he had been accustomed to pose up to now as a young man of rather
brilliant prospects."
"All these concessions and rebuffs of fortune,
of late, had wounded his spirit severely, and his temper had become
extremely irritable, his wrath being generally quite out of proportion
to the cause."
"But if he had made up his mind to put up with this sort of
life for a while, it was only on the plain understanding with his inner
self that he would very soon change it all, and have things as he
chose again."
"Yet the very means by which he hoped to make this change
threatened to involve him in even greater difficulties than he had had
before."
"The flat was divided by a passage which led straight out of the
entrance-hall."
"Along one side of this corridor lay the three rooms which
were designed for the accommodation of the “highly recommended” lodgers."
"Besides these three rooms there was another small one at the end of the
passage, close to the kitchen, which was allotted to General Ivolgin,
the nominal master of the house, who slept on a wide sofa, and was
obliged to pass into and out of his room through the kitchen, and up
or down the back stairs."
"Colia, Gania’s young brother, a school-boy of
thirteen, shared this room with his father."
"He, too, had to sleep on
an old sofa, a narrow, uncomfortable thing with a torn rug over it; his
chief duty being to look after his father, who needed to be watched more
and more every day."
"The prince was given the middle room of the three, the first being
occupied by one Ferdishenko, while the third was empty."
But Gania first conducted the prince to the family apartments.
"These
consisted of a “salon,” which became the dining-room when required; a
drawing-room, which was only a drawing-room in the morning, and became
Gania’s study in the evening, and his bedroom at night; and lastly Nina
Alexandrovna’s and Varvara’s bedroom, a small, close chamber which they
shared together."
"In a word, the whole place was confined, and a “tight fit” for the
party."
"Gania used to grind his teeth with rage over the state of
affairs; though he was anxious to be dutiful and polite to his mother."
"However, it was very soon apparent to anyone coming into the house, that
Gania was the tyrant of the family."
"Nina Alexandrovna and her daughter were both seated in the drawing-room,
engaged in knitting, and talking to a visitor, Ivan Petrovitch Ptitsin."
"The lady of the house appeared to be a woman of about fifty years of
age, thin-faced, and with black lines under the eyes."
"She looked ill and
rather sad; but her face was a pleasant one for all that; and from the
first word that fell from her lips, any stranger would at once conclude
that she was of a serious and particularly sincere nature."
"In spite of
her sorrowful expression, she gave the idea of possessing considerable
firmness and decision."
"Her dress was modest and simple to a degree, dark and elderly in style;
but both her face and appearance gave evidence that she had seen better
days."
"Varvara was a girl of some twenty-three summers, of middle height, thin,
but possessing a face which, without being actually beautiful, had
the rare quality of charm, and might fascinate even to the extent of
passionate regard."
"She was very like her mother: she even dressed like her, which proved
that she had no taste for smart clothes."
"The expression of her grey eyes
was merry and gentle, when it was not, as lately, too full of thought
and anxiety."
"The same decision and firmness was to be observed in her
face as in her mother’s, but her strength seemed to be more vigorous
than that of Nina Alexandrovna."
"She was subject to outbursts of temper,
of which even her brother was a little afraid."
"The present visitor, Ptitsin, was also afraid of her."
"This was a young
fellow of something under thirty, dressed plainly, but neatly."
"His
manners were good, but rather ponderously so."
"His dark beard bore
evidence to the fact that he was not in any government employ."
"He could
speak well, but preferred silence."
"On the whole he made a decidedly
agreeable impression."
"He was clearly attracted by Varvara, and made no
secret of his feelings."
"She trusted him in a friendly way, but had not
shown him any decided encouragement as yet, which fact did not quell his
ardour in the least."
"Nina Alexandrovna was very fond of him, and had grown quite confidential
with him of late."
"Ptitsin, as was well known, was engaged in the
business of lending out money on good security, and at a good rate of
interest."
He was a great friend of Gania’s.
"After a formal introduction by Gania (who greeted his mother very
shortly, took no notice of his sister, and immediately marched Ptitsin
out of the room), Nina Alexandrovna addressed a few kind words to the
prince and forthwith requested Colia, who had just appeared at the door,
to show him to the “middle room.”

Colia was a nice-looking boy."
"His expression was simple and confiding,
and his manners were very polite and engaging."
"“Where’s your luggage?” he asked, as he led the prince away to his room."
"“I had a bundle; it’s in the entrance hall.”

“I’ll bring it you directly."
"We only have a cook and one maid, so I have
to help as much as I can."
"Varia looks after things, generally, and
loses her temper over it."
"Gania says you have only just arrived from
Switzerland?”

“Yes.”

“Is it jolly there?”

“Very.”

“Mountains?”

“Yes.”

“I’ll go and get your bundle.”

Here Varvara joined them."
“The maid shall bring your bed-linen directly.
"Have you a portmanteau?”

“No; a bundle--your brother has just gone to the hall for it.”

“There’s nothing there except this,” said Colia, returning at this
moment."
"“Where did you put it?”

“Oh!"
"but that’s all I have,” said the prince, taking it."
“Ah!
"I thought perhaps Ferdishenko had taken it.”

“Don’t talk nonsense,” said Varia, severely."
"She seemed put out, and was
only just polite with the prince."
"“Oho!” laughed the boy, “you can be nicer than that to _me_, you know--I’m
not Ptitsin!”

“You ought to be whipped, Colia, you silly boy."
"If you want anything”
 (to the prince) “please apply to the servant."
We dine at half-past four.
"You can take your dinner with us, or have it in your room, just as you
please."
"Come along, Colia, don’t disturb the prince.”

At the door they met Gania coming in."
“Is father in?” he asked.
"Colia whispered something in his ear and went
out."
"“Just a couple of words, prince, if you’ll excuse me."
"Don’t blab over
_there_ about what you may see here, or in this house as to all that about
Aglaya and me, you know."
"Things are not altogether pleasant in this
establishment--devil take it all!"
You’ll see.
"At all events keep your
tongue to yourself for _today_.”

“I assure you I ‘blabbed’ a great deal less than you seem to suppose,”
 said the prince, with some annoyance."
"Clearly the relations between
Gania and himself were by no means improving."
"“Oh well; I caught it quite hot enough today, thanks to you."
"However,
I forgive you.”

“I think you might fairly remember that I was not in any way bound, I
had no reason to be silent about that portrait."
"You never asked me not
to mention it.”

“Pfu!"
"what a wretched room this is--dark, and the window looking
into the yard."
"Your coming to our house is, in no respect, opportune."
"However, it’s not _my_ affair."
"I don’t keep the lodgings.”

Ptitsin here looked in and beckoned to Gania, who hastily left the room,
in spite of the fact that he had evidently wished to say something more
and had only made the remark about the room to gain time."
"The prince had
hardly had time to wash and tidy himself a little when the door opened
once more, and another figure appeared."
"This was a gentleman of about thirty, tall, broad-shouldered, and
red-haired; his face was red, too, and he possessed a pair of thick
lips, a wide nose, small eyes, rather bloodshot, and with an ironical
expression in them; as though he were perpetually winking at someone."
"His whole appearance gave one the idea of impudence; his dress was
shabby."
He opened the door just enough to let his head in.
"His head remained so
placed for a few seconds while he quietly scrutinized the room; the door
then opened enough to admit his body; but still he did not enter."
"He
stood on the threshold and examined the prince carefully."
"At last he
gave the door a final shove, entered, approached the prince, took his
hand and seated himself and the owner of the room on two chairs side by
side."
"“Ferdishenko,” he said, gazing intently and inquiringly into the
prince’s eyes."
"“Very well, what next?” said the latter, almost laughing in his face."
"“A lodger here,” continued the other, staring as before."
“Do you wish to make acquaintance?” asked the prince.
"“Ah!” said the visitor, passing his fingers through his hair and
sighing."
"He then looked over to the other side of the room and around
it."
"“Got any money?” he asked, suddenly."
"“Not much.”

“How much?”

“Twenty-five roubles.”

“Let’s see it.”

The prince took his banknote out and showed it to Ferdishenko."
"The
latter unfolded it and looked at it; then he turned it round and
examined the other side; then he held it up to the light."
"“How strange that it should have browned so,” he said, reflectively."
"“These twenty-five rouble notes brown in a most extraordinary way, while
other notes often grow paler."
"Take it.”

The prince took his note."
Ferdishenko rose.
"“I came here to warn you,” he said."
"“In the first place, don’t lend me
any money, for I shall certainly ask you to.”

“Very well.”

“Shall you pay here?”

“Yes, I intend to.”

“Oh!"
I _don’t_ intend to.
Thanks.
"I live here, next door to you; you
noticed a room, did you?"
"Don’t come to me very often; I shall see you
here quite often enough."
"Have you seen the general?”

“No.”

“Nor heard him?”

“No; of course not.”

“Well, you’ll both hear and see him soon; he even tries to borrow money
from me."
"_Avis au lecteur._ Good-bye; do you think a man can possibly
live with a name like Ferdishenko?”

“Why not?”

“Good-bye.”

And so he departed."
"The prince found out afterwards that this gentleman
made it his business to amaze people with his originality and wit, but
that it did not as a rule “come off.” He even produced a bad impression
on some people, which grieved him sorely; but he did not change his ways
for all that."
"As he went out of the prince’s room, he collided with yet another
visitor coming in."
"Ferdishenko took the opportunity of making several
warning gestures to the prince from behind the new arrival’s back, and
left the room in conscious pride."
"This next arrival was a tall red-faced man of about fifty-five, with
greyish hair and whiskers, and large eyes which stood out of their
sockets."
"His appearance would have been distinguished had it not been
that he gave the idea of being rather dirty."
"He was dressed in an old
coat, and he smelled of vodka when he came near."
"His walk was effective,
and he clearly did his best to appear dignified, and to impress people
by his manner."
"This gentleman now approached the prince slowly, and with a most
courteous smile; silently took his hand and held it in his own, as he
examined the prince’s features as though searching for familiar traits
therein."
"“‘Tis he, ‘tis he!” he said at last, quietly, but with much solemnity."
“As though he were alive once more.
"I heard the familiar name--the
dear familiar name--and, oh!"
"how it reminded me of the irrevocable
past--Prince Muishkin, I believe?”

“Exactly so.”

“General Ivolgin--retired and unfortunate."
"May I ask your Christian and
generic names?”

“Lef Nicolaievitch.”

“So, so--the son of my old, I may say my childhood’s friend, Nicolai
Petrovitch.”

“My father’s name was Nicolai Lvovitch.”

“Lvovitch,” repeated the general without the slightest haste, and with
perfect confidence, just as though he had not committed himself the
least in the world, but merely made a little slip of the tongue."
"He sat
down, and taking the prince’s hand, drew him to a seat next to himself."
"“I carried you in my arms as a baby,” he observed."
“Really?” asked the prince.
"“Why, it’s twenty years since my father
died.”

“Yes, yes--twenty years and three months."
"We were educated together; I
went straight into the army, and he--”

“My father went into the army, too."
"He was a sub-lieutenant in the
Vasiliefsky regiment.”

“No, sir--in the Bielomirsky; he changed into the latter shortly before
his death."
"I was at his bedside when he died, and gave him my blessing
for eternity."
"Your mother--” The general paused, as though overcome with
emotion."
"“She died a few months later, from a cold,” said the prince."
"“Oh, not cold--believe an old man--not from a cold, but from grief for
her prince."
"Oh--your mother, your mother!"
heigh-ho!
Youth--youth!
"Your
father and I--old friends as we were--nearly murdered each other for her
sake.”

The prince began to be a little incredulous."
"“I was passionately in love with her when she was engaged--engaged to my
friend."
The prince noticed the fact and was furious.
"He came and woke me
at seven o’clock one morning."
"I rise and dress in amazement; silence on
both sides."
I understand it all.
"He takes a couple of pistols out of his
pocket--across a handkerchief--without witnesses."
"Why invite witnesses
when both of us would be walking in eternity in a couple of minutes?"
"The
pistols are loaded; we stretch the handkerchief and stand opposite one
another."
We aim the pistols at each other’s hearts.
"Suddenly tears start
to our eyes, our hands shake; we weep, we embrace--the battle is one of
self-sacrifice now!"
"The prince shouts, ‘She is yours;’ I cry, ‘She is
yours--’ in a word, in a word--You’ve come to live with us, hey?”

“Yes--yes--for a while, I think,” stammered the prince."
"“Prince, mother begs you to come to her,” said Colia, appearing at the
door."
"The prince rose to go, but the general once more laid his hand in a
friendly manner on his shoulder, and dragged him down on to the sofa."
"“As the true friend of your father, I wish to say a few words to you,”
 he began."
“I have suffered--there was a catastrophe.
"I suffered without
a trial; I had no trial."
"Nina Alexandrovna my wife, is an excellent
woman, so is my daughter Varvara."
"We have to let lodgings because we are
poor--a dreadful, unheard-of come-down for us--for me, who should
have been a governor-general; but we are very glad to have _you_, at all
events."
"Meanwhile there is a tragedy in the house.”

The prince looked inquiringly at the other."
"“Yes, a marriage is being arranged--a marriage between a questionable
woman and a young fellow who might be a flunkey."
"They wish to bring this
woman into the house where my wife and daughter reside, but while I
live and breathe she shall never enter my doors."
"I shall lie at the
threshold, and she shall trample me underfoot if she does."
"I hardly
talk to Gania now, and avoid him as much as I can."
"I warn you of this
beforehand, but you cannot fail to observe it."
"But you are the son of my
old friend, and I hope--”

“Prince, be so kind as to come to me for a moment in the drawing-room,”
 said Nina Alexandrovna herself, appearing at the door."
"“Imagine, my dear,” cried the general, “it turns out that I have nursed
the prince on my knee in the old days.” His wife looked searchingly at
him, and glanced at the prince, but said nothing."
"The prince rose and
followed her; but hardly had they reached the drawing-room, and Nina
Alexandrovna had begun to talk hurriedly, when in came the general."
She immediately relapsed into silence.
"The master of the house may have
observed this, but at all events he did not take any notice of it; he
was in high good humour."
"“A son of my old friend, dear,” he cried; “surely you must remember
Prince Nicolai Lvovitch?"
"You saw him at--at Tver.”

“I don’t remember any Nicolai Lvovitch."
"Was that your father?” she
inquired of the prince."
"“Yes, but he died at Elizabethgrad, not at Tver,” said the prince,
rather timidly."
"“So Pavlicheff told me.”

“No, Tver,” insisted the general; “he removed just before his death."
"You
were very small and cannot remember; and Pavlicheff, though an excellent
fellow, may have made a mistake.”

“You knew Pavlicheff then?”

“Oh, yes--a wonderful fellow; but I was present myself."
"I gave him my
blessing.”

“My father was just about to be tried when he died,” said the prince,
“although I never knew of what he was accused."
"He died in hospital.”

“Oh!"
"it was the Kolpakoff business, and of course he would have been
acquitted.”

“Yes?"
"Do you know that for a fact?” asked the prince, whose curiosity
was aroused by the general’s words."
“I should think so indeed!” cried the latter.
"“The court-martial came to
no decision."
"It was a mysterious, an impossible business, one might say!"
"Captain Larionoff, commander of the company, had died; his command
was handed over to the prince for the moment."
Very well.
"This soldier,
Kolpakoff, stole some leather from one of his comrades, intending to
sell it, and spent the money on drink."
Well!
"The prince--you understand
that what follows took place in the presence of the sergeant-major, and
a corporal--the prince rated Kolpakoff soundly, and threatened to have
him flogged."
"Well, Kolpakoff went back to the barracks, lay down on
a camp bedstead, and in a quarter of an hour was dead: you quite
understand?"
"It was, as I said, a strange, almost impossible, affair."
"In due course Kolpakoff was buried; the prince wrote his report, the
deceased’s name was removed from the roll."
"All as it should be, is it
not?"
"But exactly three months later at the inspection of the brigade,
the man Kolpakoff was found in the third company of the second battalion
of infantry, Novozemlianski division, just as if nothing had happened!”

“What?” said the prince, much astonished."
"“It did not occur--it’s a mistake!” said Nina Alexandrovna quickly,
looking, at the prince rather anxiously."
"“_Mon mari se trompe_,” she
added, speaking in French."
"“My dear, ‘_se trompe_’ is easily said."
"Do you remember any case at all
like it?"
Everybody was at their wits’ end.
"I should be the first to say
‘_qu’on se trompe_,’ but unfortunately I was an eye-witness, and was also
on the commission of inquiry."
"Everything proved that it was really he,
the very same soldier Kolpakoff who had been given the usual military
funeral to the sound of the drum."
"It is of course a most curious
case--nearly an impossible one."
"I recognize that... but--”

“Father, your dinner is ready,” said Varvara at this point, putting her
head in at the door."
"“Very glad, I’m particularly hungry."
"Yes, yes, a strange
coincidence--almost a psychological--”

“Your soup’ll be cold; do come.”

“Coming, coming,” said the general."
"“Son of my old friend--” he was
heard muttering as he went down the passage."
"“You will have to excuse very much in my husband, if you stay with us,”
 said Nina Alexandrovna; “but he will not disturb you often."
"He dines
alone."
"Everyone has his little peculiarities, you know, and some people
perhaps have more than those who are most pointed at and laughed at."
"One thing I must beg of you--if my husband applies to you for payment
for board and lodging, tell him that you have already paid me."
"Of course
anything paid by you to the general would be as fully settled as if
paid to me, so far as you are concerned; but I wish it to be so, if you
please, for convenience’ sake."
"What is it, Varia?”

Varia had quietly entered the room, and was holding out the portrait of
Nastasia Philipovna to her mother."
"Nina Alexandrovna started, and examined the photograph intently, gazing
at it long and sadly."
At last she looked up inquiringly at Varia.
"“It’s a present from herself to him,” said Varia; “the question is to be
finally decided this evening.”

“This evening!” repeated her mother in a tone of despair, but softly,
as though to herself."
"“Then it’s all settled, of course, and there’s no
hope left to us."
"She has anticipated her answer by the present of her
portrait."
"Did he show it you himself?” she added, in some surprise."
“You know we have hardly spoken to each other for a whole month.
"Ptitsin
told me all about it; and the photo was lying under the table, and I
picked it up.”

“Prince,” asked Nina Alexandrovna, “I wanted to inquire whether you have
known my son long?"
"I think he said that you had only arrived today from
somewhere.”

The prince gave a short narrative of what we have heard before, leaving
out the greater part."
The two ladies listened intently.
"“I did not ask about Gania out of curiosity,” said the elder, at last."
"“I wish to know how much you know about him, because he said just now
that we need not stand on ceremony with you."
"What, exactly, does that
mean?”

At this moment Gania and Ptitsin entered the room together, and Nina
Alexandrovna immediately became silent again."
"The prince remained seated
next to her, but Varia moved to the other end of the room; the portrait
of Nastasia Philipovna remained lying as before on the work-table."
"Gania
observed it there, and with a frown of annoyance snatched it up and
threw it across to his writing-table, which stood at the other end of
the room."
"“Is it today, Gania?” asked Nina Alexandrovna, at last."
“Is what today?” cried the former.
"Then suddenly recollecting himself,
he turned sharply on the prince."
"“Oh,” he growled, “I see, you are here,
that explains it!"
"Is it a disease, or what, that you can’t hold your
tongue?"
"Look here, understand once for all, prince--”

“I am to blame in this, Gania--no one else,” said Ptitsin."
Gania glanced inquiringly at the speaker.
"“It’s better so, you know, Gania--especially as, from one point of view,
the matter may be considered as settled,” said Ptitsin; and sitting
down a little way from the table he began to study a paper covered with
pencil writing."
"Gania stood and frowned, he expected a family scene."
"He never thought of
apologizing to the prince, however."
"“If it’s all settled, Gania, then of course Mr. Ptitsin is right,” said
Nina Alexandrovna."
“Don’t frown.
"You need not worry yourself, Gania;
I shall ask you no questions."
"You need not tell me anything you don’t
like."
"I assure you I have quite submitted to your will.” She said all
this, knitting away the while as though perfectly calm and composed."
"Gania was surprised, but cautiously kept silence and looked at his
mother, hoping that she would express herself more clearly."
"Nina
Alexandrovna observed his cautiousness and added, with a bitter smile:

“You are still suspicious, I see, and do not believe me; but you may
be quite at your ease."
"There shall be no more tears, nor questions--not
from my side, at all events."
"All I wish is that you may be happy, you
know that."
"I have submitted to my fate; but my heart will always be
with you, whether we remain united, or whether we part."
"Of course I only
answer for myself--you can hardly expect your sister--”

“My sister again,” cried Gania, looking at her with contempt and almost
hate."
"“Look here, mother, I have already given you my word that I shall
always respect you fully and absolutely, and so shall everyone else in
this house, be it who it may, who shall cross this threshold.”

Gania was so much relieved that he gazed at his mother almost
affectionately."
"“I was not at all afraid for myself, Gania, as you know well."
"It was not
for my own sake that I have been so anxious and worried all this time!"
They say it is all to be settled to-day.
"What is to be settled?”

“She has promised to tell me tonight at her own house whether she
consents or not,” replied Gania."
"“We have been silent on this subject for three weeks,” said his mother,
“and it was better so; and now I will only ask you one question."
"How can
she give her consent and make you a present of her portrait when you do
not love her?"
"How can such a--such a--”

“Practised hand--eh?”

“I was not going to express myself so."
"But how could you so blind her?”

Nina Alexandrovna’s question betrayed intense annoyance."
"Gania waited a
moment and then said, without taking the trouble to conceal the irony of
his tone:

“There you are, mother, you are always like that."
"You begin by promising
that there are to be no reproaches or insinuations or questions, and
here you are beginning them at once."
"We had better drop the subject--we
had, really."
"I shall never leave you, mother; any other man would cut
and run from such a sister as this."
"See how she is looking at me at this
moment!"
"Besides, how do you know that I am blinding Nastasia Philipovna?"
"As for Varia, I don’t care--she can do just as she pleases."
"There,
that’s quite enough!”

Gania’s irritation increased with every word he uttered, as he walked up
and down the room."
"These conversations always touched the family sores
before long."
"“I have said already that the moment she comes in I go out, and I shall
keep my word,” remarked Varia."
“Out of obstinacy” shouted Gania.
"“You haven’t married, either, thanks
to your obstinacy."
"Oh, you needn’t frown at me, Varvara!"
"You can go at
once for all I care; I am sick enough of your company."
"What, you are
going to leave us are you, too?” he cried, turning to the prince, who
was rising from his chair."
"Gania’s voice was full of the most uncontrolled and uncontrollable
irritation."
"The prince turned at the door to say something, but perceiving in
Gania’s expression that there was but that one drop wanting to make the
cup overflow, he changed his mind and left the room without a word."
"A few minutes later he was aware from the noisy voices in the drawing
room, that the conversation had become more quarrelsome than ever after
his departure."
"He crossed the salon and the entrance-hall, so as to pass down the
corridor into his own room."
"As he came near the front door he heard
someone outside vainly endeavouring to ring the bell, which was
evidently broken, and only shook a little, without emitting any sound."
The prince took down the chain and opened the door.
"He started back in
amazement--for there stood Nastasia Philipovna."
"He knew her at once from
her photograph."
Her eyes blazed with anger as she looked at him.
"She
quickly pushed by him into the hall, shouldering him out of her way, and
said, furiously, as she threw off her fur cloak:

“If you are too lazy to mend your bell, you should at least wait in
the hall to let people in when they rattle the bell handle."
"There, now,
you’ve dropped my fur cloak--dummy!”

Sure enough the cloak was lying on the ground."
"Nastasia had thrown it
off her towards the prince, expecting him to catch it, but the prince
had missed it."
"“Now then--announce me, quick!”

The prince wanted to say something, but was so confused and astonished
that he could not."
"However, he moved off towards the drawing-room with
the cloak over his arm."
"“Now then, where are you taking my cloak to?"
"Ha, ha, ha!"
"Are you mad?”

The prince turned and came back, more confused than ever."
"When she burst
out laughing, he smiled, but his tongue could not form a word as yet."
"At
first, when he had opened the door and saw her standing before him, he
had become as pale as death; but now the red blood had rushed back to
his cheeks in a torrent."
"“Why, what an idiot it is!” cried Nastasia, stamping her foot with
irritation."
"“Go on, do!"
"Whom are you going to announce?”

“Nastasia Philipovna,” murmured the prince."
"“And how do you know that?” she asked him, sharply."
"“I have never seen you before!”

“Go on, announce me--what’s that noise?”

“They are quarrelling,” said the prince, and entered the drawing-room,
just as matters in there had almost reached a crisis."
"Nina Alexandrovna
had forgotten that she had “submitted to everything!” She was defending
Varia."
"Ptitsin was taking her part, too."
"Not that Varia was afraid of
standing up for herself."
"She was by no means that sort of a girl; but
her brother was becoming ruder and more intolerable every moment."
"Her
usual practice in such cases as the present was to say nothing, but
stare at him, without taking her eyes off his face for an instant."
"This
manoeuvre, as she well knew, could drive Gania distracted."
"Just at this moment the door opened and the prince entered, announcing:

“Nastasia Philipovna!”

IX."
"Silence immediately fell on the room; all looked at the prince as though
they neither understood, nor hoped to understand."
"Gania was motionless
with horror."
"Nastasia’s arrival was a most unexpected and overwhelming event to all
parties."
"In the first place, she had never been before."
"Up to now she
had been so haughty that she had never even asked Gania to introduce her
to his parents."
Of late she had not so much as mentioned them.
"Gania was
partly glad of this; but still he had put it to her debit in the account
to be settled after marriage."
He would have borne anything from her rather than this visit.
"But one
thing seemed to him quite clear--her visit now, and the present of her
portrait on this particular day, pointed out plainly enough which way
she intended to make her decision!"
"The incredulous amazement with which all regarded the prince did not
last long, for Nastasia herself appeared at the door and passed in,
pushing by the prince again."
“At last I’ve stormed the citadel!
"Why do you tie up your bell?” she
said, merrily, as she pressed Gania’s hand, the latter having rushed
up to her as soon as she made her appearance."
"“What are you looking so
upset about?"
"Introduce me, please!”

The bewildered Gania introduced her first to Varia, and both women,
before shaking hands, exchanged looks of strange import."
"Nastasia,
however, smiled amiably; but Varia did not try to look amiable, and kept
her gloomy expression."
"She did not even vouchsafe the usual courteous
smile of etiquette."
"Gania darted a terrible glance of wrath at her
for this, but Nina Alexandrovna mended matters a little when Gania
introduced her at last."
"Hardly, however, had the old lady begun about
her “highly gratified feelings,” and so on, when Nastasia left her, and
flounced into a chair by Gania’s side in the corner by the window, and
cried: “Where’s your study?"
and where are the--the lodgers?
"You do take
in lodgers, don’t you?”

Gania looked dreadfully put out, and tried to say something in reply,
but Nastasia interrupted him:

“Why, where are you going to squeeze lodgers in here?"
"Don’t you use
a study?"
"Does this sort of thing pay?” she added, turning to Nina
Alexandrovna."
"“Well, it is troublesome, rather,” said the latter; “but I suppose it
will ‘pay’ pretty well."
"We have only just begun, however--”

Again Nastasia Philipovna did not hear the sentence out."
"She glanced at
Gania, and cried, laughing, “What a face!"
"My goodness, what a face you
have on at this moment!”

Indeed, Gania did not look in the least like himself."
"His bewilderment
and his alarmed perplexity passed off, however, and his lips now
twitched with rage as he continued to stare evilly at his laughing
guest, while his countenance became absolutely livid."
"There was another witness, who, though standing at the door motionless
and bewildered himself, still managed to remark Gania’s death-like
pallor, and the dreadful change that had come over his face."
"This
witness was the prince, who now advanced in alarm and muttered to Gania:

“Drink some water, and don’t look like that!”

It was clear that he came out with these words quite spontaneously, on
the spur of the moment."
"But his speech was productive of much--for
it appeared that all Gania’s rage now overflowed upon the prince."
"He
seized him by the shoulder and gazed with an intensity of loathing and
revenge at him, but said nothing--as though his feelings were too strong
to permit of words."
General agitation prevailed.
"Nina Alexandrovna gave a little cry of
anxiety; Ptitsin took a step forward in alarm; Colia and Ferdishenko
stood stock still at the door in amazement;--only Varia remained coolly
watching the scene from under her eyelashes."
"She did not sit down,
but stood by her mother with folded hands."
"However, Gania recollected
himself almost immediately."
"He let go of the prince and burst out
laughing."
"“Why, are you a doctor, prince, or what?” he asked, as naturally as
possible."
“I declare you quite frightened me!
"Nastasia Philipovna, let
me introduce this interesting character to you--though I have only known
him myself since the morning.”

Nastasia gazed at the prince in bewilderment."
“Prince?
He a Prince?
"Why,
I took him for the footman, just now, and sent him in to announce me!"
"Ha, ha, ha, isn’t that good!”

“Not bad that, not bad at all!” put in Ferdishenko, “_se non è vero_--”

“I rather think I pitched into you, too, didn’t I?"
Forgive me--do!
"Who
is he, did you say?"
What prince?
"Muishkin?” she added, addressing Gania."
"“He is a lodger of ours,” explained the latter."
"“An idiot!”--the prince distinctly heard the word half whispered from
behind him."
"This was Ferdishenko’s voluntary information for Nastasia’s
benefit."
"“Tell me, why didn’t you put me right when I made such a dreadful
mistake just now?” continued the latter, examining the prince from head
to foot without the slightest ceremony."
"She awaited the answer as though
convinced that it would be so foolish that she must inevitably fail to
restrain her laughter over it."
"“I was astonished, seeing you so suddenly--” murmured the prince."
“How did you know who I was?
Where had you seen me before?
"And why were
you so struck dumb at the sight of me?"
"What was there so overwhelming
about me?”

“Oho!"
"ho, ho, ho!” cried Ferdishenko."
"“_Now_ then, prince!"
"My word,
what things I would say if I had such a chance as that!"
"My goodness,
prince--go on!”

“So should I, in your place, I’ve no doubt!” laughed the prince to
Ferdishenko; then continued, addressing Nastasia: “Your portrait struck
me very forcibly this morning; then I was talking about you to the
Epanchins; and then, in the train, before I reached Petersburg, Parfen
Rogojin told me a good deal about you; and at the very moment that I
opened the door to you I happened to be thinking of you, when--there you
stood before me!”

“And how did you recognize me?”

“From the portrait!”

“What else?”

“I seemed to imagine you exactly as you are--I seemed to have seen you
somewhere.”

“Where--where?”

“I seem to have seen your eyes somewhere; but it cannot be!"
"I have not
seen you--I never was here before."
"I may have dreamed of you, I don’t
know.”

The prince said all this with manifest effort--in broken sentences, and
with many drawings of breath."
He was evidently much agitated.
"Nastasia
Philipovna looked at him inquisitively, but did not laugh."
"“Bravo, prince!” cried Ferdishenko, delighted."
"At this moment a loud voice from behind the group which hedged in the
prince and Nastasia Philipovna, divided the crowd, as it were, and
before them stood the head of the family, General Ivolgin."
"He was
dressed in evening clothes; his moustache was dyed."
This apparition was too much for Gania.
"Vain and ambitious almost to
morbidness, he had had much to put up with in the last two months, and
was seeking feverishly for some means of enabling himself to lead a more
presentable kind of existence."
"At home, he now adopted an attitude
of absolute cynicism, but he could not keep this up before Nastasia
Philipovna, although he had sworn to make her pay after marriage for all
he suffered now."
"He was experiencing a last humiliation, the bitterest
of all, at this moment--the humiliation of blushing for his own kindred
in his own house."
"A question flashed through his mind as to whether the
game was really worth the candle."
"For that had happened at this moment, which for two months had been his
nightmare; which had filled his soul with dread and shame--the meeting
between his father and Nastasia Philipovna."
"He had often tried to
imagine such an event, but had found the picture too mortifying and
exasperating, and had quietly dropped it."
"Very likely he anticipated
far worse things than was at all necessary; it is often so with vain
persons."
"He had long since determined, therefore, to get his father
out of the way, anywhere, before his marriage, in order to avoid such
a meeting; but when Nastasia entered the room just now, he had been so
overwhelmed with astonishment, that he had not thought of his father,
and had made no arrangements to keep him out of the way."
"And now it was
too late--there he was, and got up, too, in a dress coat and white tie,
and Nastasia in the very humour to heap ridicule on him and his family
circle; of this last fact, he felt quite persuaded."
"What else had she
come for?"
"There were his mother and his sister sitting before her, and
she seemed to have forgotten their very existence already; and if she
behaved like that, he thought, she must have some object in view."
Ferdishenko led the general up to Nastasia Philipovna.
"“Ardalion Alexandrovitch Ivolgin,” said the smiling general, with a low
bow of great dignity, “an old soldier, unfortunate, and the father
of this family; but happy in the hope of including in that family so
exquisite--”

He did not finish his sentence, for at this moment Ferdishenko pushed
a chair up from behind, and the general, not very firm on his legs,
at this post-prandial hour, flopped into it backwards."
"It was always a
difficult thing to put this warrior to confusion, and his sudden
descent left him as composed as before."
"He had sat down just opposite to
Nastasia, whose fingers he now took, and raised to his lips with great
elegance, and much courtesy."
"The general had once belonged to a very
select circle of society, but he had been turned out of it two or three
years since on account of certain weaknesses, in which he now indulged
with all the less restraint; but his good manners remained with him to
this day, in spite of all."
"Nastasia Philipovna seemed delighted at the appearance of this latest
arrival, of whom she had of course heard a good deal by report."
“I have heard that my son--” began Ardalion Alexandrovitch.
"“Your son, indeed!"
A nice papa you are!
"_You_ might have come to see me
anyhow, without compromising anyone."
"Do you hide yourself, or does your
son hide you?”

“The children of the nineteenth century, and their parents--” began the
general, again."
"“Nastasia Philipovna, will you excuse the general for a moment?"
"Someone is inquiring for him,” said Nina Alexandrovna in a loud voice,
interrupting the conversation."
“Excuse him?
"Oh no, I have wished to see him too long for that."
"Why,
what business can he have?"
"He has retired, hasn’t he?"
"You won’t leave
me, general, will you?”

“I give you my word that he shall come and see you--but he--he needs
rest just now.”

“General, they say you require rest,” said Nastasia Philipovna, with the
melancholy face of a child whose toy is taken away."
"Ardalion Alexandrovitch immediately did his best to make his foolish
position a great deal worse."
"“My dear, my dear!” he said, solemnly and reproachfully, looking at his
wife, with one hand on his heart."
"“Won’t you leave the room, mamma?” asked Varia, aloud."
"“No, Varia, I shall sit it out to the end.”

Nastasia must have overheard both question and reply, but her vivacity
was not in the least damped."
"On the contrary, it seemed to increase."
"She
immediately overwhelmed the general once more with questions, and within
five minutes that gentleman was as happy as a king, and holding forth at
the top of his voice, amid the laughter of almost all who heard him."
Colia jogged the prince’s arm.
"“Can’t _you_ get him out of the room, somehow?"
"_Do_, please,” and tears
of annoyance stood in the boy’s eyes."
"“Curse that Gania!” he muttered,
between his teeth."
"“Oh yes, I knew General Epanchin well,” General Ivolgin was saying at
this moment; “he and Prince Nicolai Ivanovitch Muishkin--whose son I
have this day embraced after an absence of twenty years--and I,
were three inseparables."
"Alas one is in the grave, torn to pieces by
calumnies and bullets; another is now before you, still battling with
calumnies and bullets--”

“Bullets?” cried Nastasia."
"“Yes, here in my chest."
"I received them at the siege of Kars, and I feel
them in bad weather now."
"And as to the third of our trio, Epanchin, of
course after that little affair with the poodle in the railway carriage,
it was all _up_ between us.”

“Poodle?"
What was that?
And in a railway carriage?
"Dear me,” said
Nastasia, thoughtfully, as though trying to recall something to mind."
"“Oh, just a silly, little occurrence, really not worth telling, about
Princess Bielokonski’s governess, Miss Smith, and--oh, it is really not
worth telling!”

“No, no, we must have it!” cried Nastasia merrily."
"“Yes, of course,” said Ferdishenko."
"“C’est du nouveau.”

“Ardalion,” said Nina Alexandrovitch, entreatingly."
"“Papa, you are wanted!” cried Colia."
"“Well, it is a silly little story, in a few words,” began the delighted
general."
"“A couple of years ago, soon after the new railway was opened,
I had to go somewhere or other on business."
"Well, I took a first-class
ticket, sat down, and began to smoke, or rather _continued_ to smoke, for
I had lighted up before."
I was alone in the carriage.
"Smoking is not
allowed, but is not prohibited either; it is half allowed--so to speak,
winked at."
"I had the window open.”

“Suddenly, just before the whistle, in came two ladies with a little
poodle, and sat down opposite to me; not bad-looking women; one was in
light blue, the other in black silk."
"The poodle, a beauty with a silver
collar, lay on light blue’s knee."
"They looked haughtily about, and
talked English together."
"I took no notice, just went on smoking."
"I
observed that the ladies were getting angry--over my cigar, doubtless."
One looked at me through her tortoise-shell eyeglass.
"“I took no notice, because they never said a word."
"If they didn’t like
the cigar, why couldn’t they say so?"
"Not a word, not a hint!"
"Suddenly,
and without the very slightest suspicion of warning, ‘light blue’ seizes
my cigar from between my fingers, and, wheugh!"
"out of the window with
it!"
"Well, on flew the train, and I sat bewildered, and the young woman,
tall and fair, and rather red in the face, too red, glared at me with
flashing eyes."
"“I didn’t say a word, but with extreme courtesy, I may say with most
refined courtesy, I reached my finger and thumb over towards the poodle,
took it up delicately by the nape of the neck, and chucked it out of
the window, after the cigar."
"The train went flying on, and the poodle’s
yells were lost in the distance.”

“Oh, you naughty man!” cried Nastasia, laughing and clapping her hands
like a child."
“Bravo!” said Ferdishenko.
"Ptitsin laughed too, though he had been very
sorry to see the general appear."
"Even Colia laughed and said, “Bravo!”

“And I was right, truly right,” cried the general, with warmth and
solemnity, “for if cigars are forbidden in railway carriages, poodles
are much more so.”

“Well, and what did the lady do?” asked Nastasia, impatiently."
"“She--ah, that’s where all the mischief of it lies!” replied Ivolgin,
frowning."
"“Without a word, as it were, of warning, she slapped me on the
cheek!"
"An extraordinary woman!”

“And you?”

The general dropped his eyes, and elevated his brows; shrugged his
shoulders, tightened his lips, spread his hands, and remained silent."
"At
last he blurted out:

“I lost my head!”

“Did you hit her?”

“No, oh no!--there was a great flare-up, but I didn’t hit her!"
"I had to
struggle a little, purely to defend myself; but the very devil was
in the business."
"It turned out that ‘light blue’ was an Englishwoman,
governess or something, at Princess Bielokonski’s, and the other woman
was one of the old-maid princesses Bielokonski."
"Well, everybody knows
what great friends the princess and Mrs. Epanchin are, so there was a
pretty kettle of fish."
"All the Bielokonskis went into mourning for the
poodle."
"Six princesses in tears, and the Englishwoman shrieking!"
"“Of course I wrote an apology, and called, but they would not receive
either me or my apology, and the Epanchins cut me, too!”

“But wait,” said Nastasia."
"“How is it that, five or six days since,
I read exactly the same story in the paper, as happening between a
Frenchman and an English girl?"
"The cigar was snatched away exactly as
you describe, and the poodle was chucked out of the window after it."
"The
slapping came off, too, as in your case; and the girl’s dress was light
blue!”

The general blushed dreadfully; Colia blushed too; and Ptitsin turned
hastily away."
"Ferdishenko was the only one who laughed as gaily as
before."
"As to Gania, I need not say that he was miserable; he stood dumb
and wretched and took no notice of anybody."
"“I assure you,” said the general, “that exactly the same thing happened
to myself!”

“I remembered there was some quarrel between father and Miss Smith, the
Bielokonski’s governess,” said Colia."
"“How very curious, point for point the same anecdote, and happening at
different ends of Europe!"
"Even the light blue dress the same,” continued
the pitiless Nastasia."
"“I must really send you the paper.”

“You must observe,” insisted the general, “that my experience was two
years earlier.”

“Ah!"
"that’s it, no doubt!”

Nastasia Philipovna laughed hysterically."
"“Father, will you hear a word from me outside!” said Gania, his voice
shaking with agitation, as he seized his father by the shoulder."
"His
eyes shone with a blaze of hatred."
"At this moment there was a terrific bang at the front door, almost
enough to break it down."
Some most unusual visitor must have arrived.
Colia ran to open.
X.
The entrance-hall suddenly became full of noise and people.
"To judge
from the sounds which penetrated to the drawing-room, a number of people
had already come in, and the stampede continued."
"Several voices were
talking and shouting at once; others were talking and shouting on the
stairs outside; it was evidently a most extraordinary visit that was
about to take place."
Everyone exchanged startled glances.
"Gania rushed out towards the
dining-room, but a number of men had already made their way in, and met
him."
“Ah!
"here he is, the Judas!” cried a voice which the prince recognized
at once."
"“How d’ye do, Gania, you old blackguard?”

“Yes, that’s the man!” said another voice."
"There was no room for doubt in the prince’s mind: one of the voices was
Rogojin’s, and the other Lebedeff’s."
"Gania stood at the door like a block and looked on in silence, putting
no obstacle in the way of their entrance, and ten or a dozen men
marched in behind Parfen Rogojin."
"They were a decidedly mixed-looking
collection, and some of them came in in their furs and caps."
"None of
them were quite drunk, but all appeared to be considerably excited."
"They seemed to need each other’s support, morally, before they dared
come in; not one of them would have entered alone but with the rest each
one was brave enough."
"Even Rogojin entered rather cautiously at the head
of his troop; but he was evidently preoccupied."
"He appeared to be gloomy
and morose, and had clearly come with some end in view."
"All the rest
were merely chorus, brought in to support the chief character."
"Besides
Lebedeff there was the dandy Zalesheff, who came in without his coat
and hat, two or three others followed his example; the rest were
more uncouth."
"They included a couple of young merchants, a man in
a great-coat, a medical student, a little Pole, a small fat man who
laughed continuously, and an enormously tall stout one who apparently
put great faith in the strength of his fists."
"A couple of “ladies” of
some sort put their heads in at the front door, but did not dare come
any farther."
"Colia promptly banged the door in their faces and locked
it."
"“Hallo, Gania, you blackguard!"
"You didn’t expect Rogojin, eh?” said the
latter, entering the drawing-room, and stopping before Gania."
"But at this moment he saw, seated before him, Nastasia Philipovna."
"He had not dreamed of meeting her here, evidently, for her appearance
produced a marvellous effect upon him."
"He grew pale, and his lips became
actually blue."
"“I suppose it is true, then!” he muttered to himself, and his face took
on an expression of despair."
“So that’s the end of it!
"Now you, sir,
will you answer me or not?” he went on suddenly, gazing at Gania with
ineffable malice."
"“Now then, you--”

He panted, and could hardly speak for agitation."
"He advanced into the
room mechanically; but perceiving Nina Alexandrovna and Varia he became
more or less embarrassed, in spite of his excitement."
"His followers
entered after him, and all paused a moment at sight of the ladies."
"Of
course their modesty was not fated to be long-lived, but for a moment
they were abashed."
"Once let them begin to shout, however, and nothing on
earth should disconcert them."
"“What, you here too, prince?” said Rogojin, absently, but a little
surprised all the same “Still in your gaiters, eh?” He sighed, and
forgot the prince next moment, and his wild eyes wandered over to
Nastasia again, as though attracted in that direction by some magnetic
force."
Nastasia looked at the new arrivals with great curiosity.
"Gania
recollected himself at last."
"“Excuse me, sirs,” he said, loudly, “but what does all this mean?”
 He glared at the advancing crowd generally, but addressed his remarks
especially to their captain, Rogojin."
"“You are not in a stable,
gentlemen, though you may think it--my mother and sister are present.”

“Yes, I see your mother and sister,” muttered Rogojin, through his
teeth; and Lebedeff seemed to feel himself called upon to second the
statement."
"“At all events, I must request you to step into the salon,” said Gania,
his rage rising quite out of proportion to his words, “and then I shall
inquire--”

“What, he doesn’t know me!” said Rogojin, showing his teeth
disagreeably."
"“He doesn’t recognize Rogojin!” He did not move an inch,
however."
"“I have met you somewhere, I believe, but--”

“Met me somewhere, pfu!"
"Why, it’s only three months since I lost two
hundred roubles of my father’s money to you, at cards."
"The old fellow
died before he found out."
Ptitsin knows all about it.
"Why, I’ve only to
pull out a three-rouble note and show it to you, and you’d crawl on your
hands and knees to the other end of the town for it; that’s the sort of
man you are."
"Why, I’ve come now, at this moment, to buy you up!"
"Oh, you
needn’t think that because I wear these boots I have no money."
"I have
lots of money, my beauty,--enough to buy up you and all yours together."
"So I shall, if I like to!"
I’ll buy you up!
"I will!” he yelled,
apparently growing more and more intoxicated and excited."
"“Oh, Nastasia
Philipovna!"
don’t turn me out!
"Say one word, do!"
"Are you going to marry
this man, or not?”

Rogojin asked his question like a lost soul appealing to some divinity,
with the reckless daring of one appointed to die, who has nothing to
lose."
He awaited the reply in deadly anxiety.
"Nastasia Philipovna gazed at him with a haughty, ironical expression of
face; but when she glanced at Nina Alexandrovna and Varia, and from them
to Gania, she changed her tone, all of a sudden."
“Certainly not; what are you thinking of?
"What could have induced you
to ask such a question?” she replied, quietly and seriously, and even,
apparently, with some astonishment."
“No?
"No?” shouted Rogojin, almost out of his mind with joy."
"“You are
not going to, after all?"
"And they told me--oh, Nastasia Philipovna--they
said you had promised to marry him, _him!_ As if you _could_ do
it!--him--pooh!"
"I don’t mind saying it to everyone--I’d buy him off
for a hundred roubles, any day pfu!"
"Give him a thousand, or three if he
likes, poor devil, and he’d cut and run the day before his wedding, and
leave his bride to me!"
"Wouldn’t you, Gania, you blackguard?"
"You’d take
three thousand, wouldn’t you?"
Here’s the money!
"Look, I’ve come on
purpose to pay you off and get your receipt, formally."
"I said I’d buy
you up, and so I will.”

“Get out of this, you drunken beast!” cried Gania, who was red and white
by turns."
"Rogojin’s troop, who were only waiting for an excuse, set up a howl at
this."
Lebedeff stepped forward and whispered something in Parfen’s ear.
"“You’re right, clerk,” said the latter, “you’re right, tipsy
spirit--you’re right!--Nastasia Philipovna,” he added, looking at her
like some lunatic, harmless generally, but suddenly wound up to a pitch
of audacity, “here are eighteen thousand roubles, and--and you shall
have more--.” Here he threw a packet of bank-notes tied up in white
paper, on the table before her, not daring to say all he wished to say."
"“No--no--no!” muttered Lebedeff, clutching at his arm."
"He was clearly
aghast at the largeness of the sum, and thought a far smaller amount
should have been tried first."
"“No, you fool--you don’t know whom you are dealing with--and it appears
I am a fool, too!” said Parfen, trembling beneath the flashing glance
of Nastasia."
"“Oh, curse it all!"
"What a fool I was to listen to you!” he
added, with profound melancholy."
"Nastasia Philipovna, observing his woe-begone expression, suddenly burst
out laughing."
"“Eighteen thousand roubles, for me?"
"Why, you declare yourself a fool at
once,” she said, with impudent familiarity, as she rose from the sofa
and prepared to go."
"Gania watched the whole scene with a sinking of the
heart."
"“Forty thousand, then--forty thousand roubles instead of eighteen!"
"Ptitsin and another have promised to find me forty thousand roubles by
seven o’clock tonight."
"Forty thousand roubles--paid down on the nail!”

The scene was growing more and more disgraceful; but Nastasia Philipovna
continued to laugh and did not go away."
"Nina Alexandrovna and Varia had
both risen from their places and were waiting, in silent horror, to
see what would happen."
"Varia’s eyes were all ablaze with anger; but
the scene had a different effect on Nina Alexandrovna."
"She paled and
trembled, and looked more and more like fainting every moment."
"“Very well then, a _hundred_ thousand!"
a hundred thousand!
"paid this
very day."
Ptitsin!
find it for me.
"A good share shall stick to your
fingers--come!”

“You are mad!” said Ptitsin, coming up quickly and seizing him by the
hand."
“You’re drunk--the police will be sent for if you don’t look out.
"Think where you are.”

“Yes, he’s boasting like a drunkard,” added Nastasia, as though with the
sole intention of goading him."
“I do _not_ boast!
"You shall have a hundred thousand, this very day."
"Ptitsin, get the money, you gay usurer!"
"Take what you like for it, but
get it by the evening!"
"I’ll show that I’m in earnest!” cried Rogojin,
working himself up into a frenzy of excitement."
"“Come, come; what’s all this?” cried General Ivolgin, suddenly and
angrily, coming close up to Rogojin."
"The unexpectedness of this sally on
the part of the hitherto silent old man caused some laughter among the
intruders."
“Halloa!
what’s this now?” laughed Rogojin.
"“You come along with me, old
fellow!"
"You shall have as much to drink as you like.”

“Oh, it’s too horrible!” cried poor Colia, sobbing with shame and
annoyance."
"“Surely there must be someone among all of you here who will turn this
shameless creature out of the room?” cried Varia, suddenly."
"She was
shaking and trembling with rage."
"“That’s me, I suppose."
"I’m the shameless creature!” cried Nastasia
Philipovna, with amused indifference."
"“Dear me, and I came--like a fool,
as I am--to invite them over to my house for the evening!"
"Look how your
sister treats me, Gavrila Ardalionovitch.”

For some moments Gania stood as if stunned or struck by lightning, after
his sister’s speech."
"But seeing that Nastasia Philipovna was really
about to leave the room this time, he sprang at Varia and seized her by
the arm like a madman."
"“What have you done?” he hissed, glaring at her as though he would like
to annihilate her on the spot."
"He was quite beside himself, and could
hardly articulate his words for rage."
“What have I done?
"Where are you dragging me to?”

“Do you wish me to beg pardon of this creature because she has come here
to insult our mother and disgrace the whole household, you low, base
wretch?” cried Varia, looking back at her brother with proud defiance."
"A few moments passed as they stood there face to face, Gania still
holding her wrist tightly."
"Varia struggled once--twice--to get free;
then could restrain herself no longer, and spat in his face."
“There’s a girl for you!” cried Nastasia Philipovna.
“Mr.
"Ptitsin, I
congratulate you on your choice.”

Gania lost his head."
"Forgetful of everything he aimed a blow at Varia,
which would inevitably have laid her low, but suddenly another hand
caught his."
Between him and Varia stood the prince.
"“Enough--enough!” said the latter, with insistence, but all of a tremble
with excitement."
"“Are you going to cross my path for ever, damn you!” cried Gania; and,
loosening his hold on Varia, he slapped the prince’s face with all his
force."
Exclamations of horror arose on all sides.
"The prince grew pale as
death; he gazed into Gania’s eyes with a strange, wild, reproachful
look; his lips trembled and vainly endeavoured to form some words; then
his mouth twisted into an incongruous smile."
"“Very well--never mind about me; but I shall not allow you to strike
her!” he said, at last, quietly."
"Then, suddenly, he could bear it no
longer, and covering his face with his hands, turned to the wall, and
murmured in broken accents:

“Oh!"
"how ashamed you will be of this afterwards!”

Gania certainly did look dreadfully abashed."
"Colia rushed up to comfort
the prince, and after him crowded Varia, Rogojin and all, even the
general."
"“It’s nothing, it’s nothing!” said the prince, and again he wore the
smile which was so inconsistent with the circumstances."
"“Yes, he will be ashamed!” cried Rogojin."
"“You will be properly ashamed
of yourself for having injured such a--such a sheep” (he could not find
a better word)."
"“Prince, my dear fellow, leave this and come away with
me."
"I’ll show you how Rogojin shows his affection for his friends.”

Nastasia Philipovna was also much impressed, both with Gania’s action
and with the prince’s reply."
"Her usually thoughtful, pale face, which all this while had been so
little in harmony with the jests and laughter which she had seemed to
put on for the occasion, was now evidently agitated by new feelings,
though she tried to conceal the fact and to look as though she were as
ready as ever for jesting and irony."
"“I really think I must have seen him somewhere!” she murmured seriously
enough."
"“Oh, aren’t you ashamed of yourself--aren’t you ashamed?"
"Are you really
the sort of woman you are trying to represent yourself to be?"
"Is
it possible?” The prince was now addressing Nastasia, in a tone of
reproach, which evidently came from his very heart."
"Nastasia Philipovna looked surprised, and smiled, but evidently
concealed something beneath her smile and with some confusion and a
glance at Gania she left the room."
"However, she had not reached the outer hall when she turned round,
walked quickly up to Nina Alexandrovna, seized her hand and lifted it to
her lips."
“He guessed quite right.
"I am not that sort of woman,” she whispered
hurriedly, flushing red all over."
"Then she turned again and left the
room so quickly that no one could imagine what she had come back for."
"All they saw was that she said something to Nina Alexandrovna in a
hurried whisper, and seemed to kiss her hand."
"Varia, however, both saw
and heard all, and watched Nastasia out of the room with an expression
of wonder."
"Gania recollected himself in time to rush after her in order to show her
out, but she had gone."
He followed her to the stairs.
"“Don’t come with me,” she cried, “_Au revoir_, till the evening--do you
hear?"
"_Au revoir!_”

He returned thoughtful and confused; the riddle lay heavier than ever on
his soul."
"He was troubled about the prince, too, and so bewildered that
he did not even observe Rogojin’s rowdy band crowd past him and step on
his toes, at the door as they went out."
They were all talking at once.
"Rogojin went ahead of the others, talking to Ptitsin, and apparently
insisting vehemently upon something very important."
"“You’ve lost the game, Gania” he cried, as he passed the latter."
"Gania gazed after him uneasily, but said nothing."
XI.
The prince now left the room and shut himself up in his own chamber.
"Colia followed him almost at once, anxious to do what he could to
console him."
"The poor boy seemed to be already so attached to him that
he could hardly leave him."
“You were quite right to go away!” he said.
"“The row will rage there
worse than ever now; and it’s like this every day with us--and all
through that Nastasia Philipovna.”

“You have so many sources of trouble here, Colia,” said the prince."
"“Yes, indeed, and it is all our own fault."
"But I have a great friend who
is much worse off even than we are."
"Would you like to know him?”

“Yes, very much."
"Is he one of your school-fellows?”

“Well, not exactly."
"I will tell you all about him some day.... What do
you think of Nastasia Philipovna?"
"She is beautiful, isn’t she?"
"I
had never seen her before, though I had a great wish to do so."
"She
fascinated me."
"I could forgive Gania if he were to marry her for love,
but for money!"
Oh dear!
"that is horrible!”

“Yes, your brother does not attract me much.”

“I am not surprised at that."
After what you...
"But I do hate that way
of looking at things!"
"Because some fool, or a rogue pretending to be a
fool, strikes a man, that man is to be dishonoured for his whole life,
unless he wipes out the disgrace with blood, or makes his assailant beg
forgiveness on his knees!"
I think that so very absurd and tyrannical.
"Lermontoff’s Bal Masque is based on that idea--a stupid and unnatural
one, in my opinion; but he was hardly more than a child when he wrote
it.”

“I like your sister very much.”

“Did you see how she spat in Gania’s face!"
Varia is afraid of no one.
"But you did not follow her example, and yet I am sure it was not through
cowardice."
Here she comes!
Speak of a wolf and you see his tail!
"I felt
sure that she would come."
"She is very generous, though of course she has
her faults.”

Varia pounced upon her brother."
"“This is not the place for you,” said she."
“Go to father.
"Is he plaguing
you, prince?”

“Not in the least; on the contrary, he interests me.”

“Scolding as usual, Varia!"
It is the worst thing about her.
"After all,
I believe father may have started off with Rogojin."
"No doubt he is sorry
now."
"Perhaps I had better go and see what he is doing,” added Colia,
running off."
"“Thank God, I have got mother away, and put her to bed without another
scene!"
Gania is worried--and ashamed--not without reason!
"What a
spectacle!"
"I have come to thank you once more, prince, and to ask you if
you knew Nastasia Philipovna before?”

“No, I have never known her.”

“Then what did you mean, when you said straight out to her that she was
not really ‘like that’?"
"You guessed right, I fancy."
"It is quite possible
she was not herself at the moment, though I cannot fathom her meaning."
Evidently she meant to hurt and insult us.
"I have heard curious tales
about her before now, but if she came to invite us to her house, why
did she behave so to my mother?"
"Ptitsin knows her very well; he says he
could not understand her today."
"With Rogojin, too!"
"No one with a spark
of self-respect could have talked like that in the house of her..."
"Mother is extremely vexed on your account, too...

“That is nothing!” said the prince, waving his hand."
"“But how meek she was when you spoke to her!”

“Meek!"
"What do you mean?”

“You told her it was a shame for her to behave so, and her manner
changed at once; she was like another person."
"You have some influence
over her, prince,” added Varia, smiling a little."
"The door opened at this point, and in came Gania most unexpectedly."
"He was not in the least disconcerted to see Varia there, but he stood a
moment at the door, and then approached the prince quietly."
"“Prince,” he said, with feeling, “I was a blackguard."
"Forgive me!” His
face gave evidence of suffering."
"The prince was considerably amazed,
and did not reply at once."
"“Oh, come, forgive me, forgive me!” Gania
insisted, rather impatiently."
"“If you like, I’ll kiss your hand."
"There!”

The prince was touched; he took Gania’s hands, and embraced him
heartily, while each kissed the other."
"“I never, never thought you were like that,” said Muishkin, drawing a
deep breath."
"“I thought you--you weren’t capable of--”

“Of what?"
"Apologizing, eh?"
"And where on earth did I get the idea
that you were an idiot?"
"You always observe what other people pass by
unnoticed; one could talk sense to you, but--”

“Here is another to whom you should apologize,” said the prince,
pointing to Varia."
"“No, no!"
they are all enemies!
"I’ve tried them often enough, believe
me,” and Gania turned his back on Varia with these words."
“But if I beg you to make it up?” said Varia.
"“And you’ll go to Nastasia Philipovna’s this evening--”

“If you insist: but, judge for yourself, can I go, ought I to go?”

“But she is not that sort of woman, I tell you!” said Gania, angrily."
"“She was only acting.”

“I know that--I know that; but what a part to play!"
"And think what she
must take _you_ for, Gania!"
"I know she kissed mother’s hand, and all that,
but she laughed at you, all the same."
"All this is not good enough
for seventy-five thousand roubles, my dear boy."
"You are capable of
honourable feelings still, and that’s why I am talking to you so."
Oh!
"_do_
take care what you are doing!"
"Don’t you know yourself that it will end
badly, Gania?”

So saying, and in a state of violent agitation, Varia left the room."
"“There, they are all like that,” said Gania, laughing, “just as if I do
not know all about it much better than they do.”

He sat down with these words, evidently intending to prolong his visit."
"“If you know it so well,” said the prince a little timidly, “why do you
choose all this worry for the sake of the seventy-five thousand, which,
you confess, does not cover it?”

“I didn’t mean that,” said Gania; “but while we are upon the subject,
let me hear your opinion."
"Is all this worry worth seventy-five thousand
or not?”

“Certainly not.”

“Of course!"
"And it would be a disgrace to marry so, eh?”

“A great disgrace.”

“Oh, well, then you may know that I shall certainly do it, now."
"I shall
certainly marry her."
"I was not quite sure of myself before, but now I
am."
"Don’t say a word: I know what you want to tell me--”

“No."
"I was only going to say that what surprises me most of all is your
extraordinary confidence.”

“How so?"
"What in?”

“That Nastasia Philipovna will accept you, and that the question is as
good as settled; and secondly, that even if she did, you would be able
to pocket the money."
"Of course, I know very little about it, but that’s
my view."
"When a man marries for money it often happens that the wife
keeps the money in her own hands.”

“Of course, you don’t know all; but, I assure you, you needn’t be
afraid, it won’t be like that in our case."
"There are circumstances,”
 said Gania, rather excitedly."
"“And as to her answer to me, there’s no
doubt about that."
"Why should you suppose she will refuse me?”

“Oh, I only judge by what I see."
"Varvara Ardalionovna said just now--”

“Oh she--they don’t know anything about it!"
"Nastasia was only chaffing
Rogojin."
"I was alarmed at first, but I have thought better of it now;
she was simply laughing at him."
"She looks on me as a fool because I show
that I meant her money, and doesn’t realize that there are other men
who would deceive her in far worse fashion."
"I’m not going to pretend
anything, and you’ll see she’ll marry me, all right."
"If she likes to
live quietly, so she shall; but if she gives me any of her nonsense, I
shall leave her at once, but I shall keep the money."
"I’m not going to
look a fool; that’s the first thing, not to look a fool.”

“But Nastasia Philipovna seems to me to be such a _sensible_ woman, and,
as such, why should she run blindly into this business?"
"That’s what
puzzles me so,” said the prince."
"“You don’t know all, you see; I tell you there are things--and besides,
I’m sure that she is persuaded that I love her to distraction, and I
give you my word I have a strong suspicion that she loves me, too--in
her own way, of course."
"She thinks she will be able to make a sort of
slave of me all my life; but I shall prepare a little surprise for her."
"I don’t know whether I ought to be confidential with you, prince; but,
I assure you, you are the only decent fellow I have come across."
"I have
not spoken so sincerely as I am doing at this moment for years."
"There
are uncommonly few honest people about, prince; there isn’t one honester
than Ptitsin, he’s the best of the lot."
Are you laughing?
"You don’t
know, perhaps, that blackguards like honest people, and being one myself
I like you."
_Why_ am I a blackguard?
"Tell me honestly, now."
"They all call
me a blackguard because of her, and I have got into the way of thinking
myself one."
"That’s what is so bad about the business.”

“_I_ for one shall never think you a blackguard again,” said the prince."
"“I confess I had a poor opinion of you at first, but I have been so
joyfully surprised about you just now; it’s a good lesson for me."
"I
shall never judge again without a thorough trial."
"I see now that you are
not only not a blackguard, but are not even quite spoiled."
"I see that
you are quite an ordinary man, not original in the least degree, but
rather weak.”

Gania laughed sarcastically, but said nothing."
"The prince, seeing that
he did not quite like the last remark, blushed, and was silent too."
"“Has my father asked you for money?” asked Gania, suddenly."
"“No.”

“Don’t give it to him if he does."
"Fancy, he was a decent, respectable
man once!"
"He was received in the best society; he was not always the
liar he is now."
"Of course, wine is at the bottom of it all; but he is a
good deal worse than an innocent liar now."
"Do you know that he keeps a
mistress?"
I can’t understand how mother is so long-suffering.
"Did he
tell you the story of the siege of Kars?"
"Or perhaps the one about his
grey horse that talked?"
"He loves to enlarge on these absurd histories.”
 And Gania burst into a fit of laughter."
"Suddenly he turned to the prince
and asked: “Why are you looking at me like that?”

“I am surprised to see you laugh in that way, like a child."
"You came
to make friends with me again just now, and you said, ‘I will kiss your
hand, if you like,’ just as a child would have said it."
"And then, all at
once you are talking of this mad project--of these seventy-five thousand
roubles!"
"It all seems so absurd and impossible.”

“Well, what conclusion have you reached?”

“That you are rushing madly into the undertaking, and that you would
do well to think it over again."
"It is more than possible that Varvara
Ardalionovna is right.”

“Ah!"
now you begin to moralize!
"I know that I am only a child, very
well,” replied Gania impatiently."
"“That is proved by my having this
conversation with you."
"It is not for money only, prince, that I am
rushing into this affair,” he continued, hardly master of his words,
so closely had his vanity been touched."
"“If I reckoned on that I should
certainly be deceived, for I am still too weak in mind and character."
"I am obeying a passion, an impulse perhaps, because I have but one aim,
one that overmasters all else."
"You imagine that once I am in possession
of these seventy-five thousand roubles, I shall rush to buy a
carriage... No, I shall go on wearing the old overcoat I have worn for
three years, and I shall give up my club."
"I shall follow the example of
men who have made their fortunes."
"When Ptitsin was seventeen he slept
in the street, he sold pen-knives, and began with a copeck; now he has
sixty thousand roubles, but to get them, what has he not done?"
"Well,
I shall be spared such a hard beginning, and shall start with a little
capital."
"In fifteen years people will say, ‘Look, that’s Ivolgin, the
king of the Jews!’ You say that I have no originality."
"Now mark this,
prince--there is nothing so offensive to a man of our time and race
than to be told that he is wanting in originality, that he is weak
in character, has no particular talent, and is, in short, an ordinary
person."
"You have not even done me the honour of looking upon me as a
rogue."
"Do you know, I could have knocked you down for that just now!"
"You
wounded me more cruelly than Epanchin, who thinks me capable of selling
him my wife!"
"Observe, it was a perfectly gratuitous idea on his part,
seeing there has never been any discussion of it between us!"
"This has
exasperated me, and I am determined to make a fortune!"
I will do it!
"Once I am rich, I shall be a genius, an extremely original man."
"One of
the vilest and most hateful things connected with money is that it can
buy even talent; and will do so as long as the world lasts."
"You will say
that this is childish--or romantic."
"Well, that will be all the better
for me, but the thing shall be done."
I will carry it through.
"He laughs
most, who laughs last."
Why does Epanchin insult me?
"Simply because,
socially, I am a nobody."
"However, enough for the present."
"Colia has put
his nose in to tell us dinner is ready, twice."
I’m dining out.
"I shall
come and talk to you now and then; you shall be comfortable enough with
us."
They are sure to make you one of the family.
"I think you and I
will either be great friends or enemies."
"Look here now, supposing I had
kissed your hand just now, as I offered to do in all sincerity, should I
have hated you for it afterwards?”

“Certainly, but not always."
"You would not have been able to keep it up,
and would have ended by forgiving me,” said the prince, after a pause
for reflection, and with a pleasant smile."
"“Oho, how careful one has to be with you, prince!"
"Haven’t you put a drop
of poison in that remark now, eh?"
"By the way--ha, ha, ha!--I forgot to
ask, was I right in believing that you were a good deal struck yourself
with Nastasia Philipovna.”

“Ye-yes.”

“Are you in love with her?”

“N-no.”

“And yet you flush up as red as a rosebud!"
Come--it’s all right.
"I’m not
going to laugh at you."
Do you know she is a very virtuous woman?
"Believe
it or not, as you like."
"You think she and Totski--not a bit of it, not a
bit of it!"
Not for ever so long!
"_Au revoir!_”

Gania left the room in great good humour."
"The prince stayed behind, and
meditated alone for a few minutes."
"At length, Colia popped his head in
once more."
"“I don’t want any dinner, thanks, Colia."
"I had too good a lunch at
General Epanchin’s.”

Colia came into the room and gave the prince a note; it was from the
general and was carefully sealed up."
"It was clear from Colia’s face how
painful it was to him to deliver the missive."
"The prince read it, rose,
and took his hat."
"“It’s only a couple of yards,” said Colia, blushing."
"“He’s sitting there over his bottle--and how they can give him credit,
I cannot understand."
"Don’t tell mother I brought you the note, prince;
I have sworn not to do it a thousand times, but I’m always so sorry for
him."
"Don’t stand on ceremony, give him some trifle, and let that end
it.”

“Come along, Colia, I want to see your father."
"I have an idea,” said the
prince."
XII.
"Colia took the prince to a public-house in the Litaynaya, not far off."
"In one of the side rooms there sat at a table--looking like one of the
regular guests of the establishment--Ardalion Alexandrovitch, with a
bottle before him, and a newspaper on his knee."
"He was waiting for
the prince, and no sooner did the latter appear than he began a long
harangue about something or other; but so far gone was he that the
prince could hardly understand a word."
"“I have not got a ten-rouble note,” said the prince; “but here is a
twenty-five."
"Change it and give me back the fifteen, or I shall be left
without a farthing myself.”

“Oh, of course, of course; and you quite understand that I--”

“Yes; and I have another request to make, general."
"Have you ever been at
Nastasia Philipovna’s?”

“I?"
I?
Do you mean me?
"Often, my friend, often!"
"I only pretended I
had not in order to avoid a painful subject."
"You saw today, you were a
witness, that I did all that a kind, an indulgent father could do."
"Now
a father of altogether another type shall step into the scene."
"You shall
see; the old soldier shall lay bare this intrigue, or a shameless woman
will force her way into a respectable and noble family.”

“Yes, quite so."
"I wished to ask you whether you could show me the way
to Nastasia Philipovna’s tonight."
"I must go; I have business with her; I
was not invited but I was introduced."
"Anyhow I am ready to trespass the
laws of propriety if only I can get in somehow or other.”

“My dear young friend, you have hit on my very idea."
"It was not for this
rubbish I asked you to come over here” (he pocketed the money, however,
at this point), “it was to invite your alliance in the campaign against
Nastasia Philipovna tonight."
"How well it sounds, ‘General Ivolgin and
Prince Muishkin.’ That’ll fetch her, I think, eh?"
Capital!
"We’ll go at
nine; there’s time yet.”

“Where does she live?”

“Oh, a long way off, near the Great Theatre, just in the square
there--It won’t be a large party.”

The general sat on and on."
"He had ordered a fresh bottle when the prince
arrived; this took him an hour to drink, and then he had another, and
another, during the consumption of which he told pretty nearly the whole
story of his life."
The prince was in despair.
"He felt that though he had
but applied to this miserable old drunkard because he saw no other way
of getting to Nastasia Philipovna’s, yet he had been very wrong to put
the slightest confidence in such a man."
At last he rose and declared that he would wait no longer.
"The general
rose too, drank the last drops that he could squeeze out of the bottle,
and staggered into the street."
Muishkin began to despair.
"He could not imagine how he had been so
foolish as to trust this man."
"He only wanted one thing, and that was to
get to Nastasia Philipovna’s, even at the cost of a certain amount
of impropriety."
"But now the scandal threatened to be more than he
had bargained for."
"By this time Ardalion Alexandrovitch was quite
intoxicated, and he kept his companion listening while he discoursed
eloquently and pathetically on subjects of all kinds, interspersed with
torrents of recrimination against the members of his family."
"He insisted
that all his troubles were caused by their bad conduct, and time alone
would put an end to them."
At last they reached the Litaynaya.
"The thaw increased steadily, a warm,
unhealthy wind blew through the streets, vehicles splashed through the
mud, and the iron shoes of horses and mules rang on the paving stones."
"Crowds of melancholy people plodded wearily along the footpaths, with
here and there a drunken man among them."
“Do you see those brightly-lighted windows?” said the general.
"“Many of
my old comrades-in-arms live about here, and I, who served longer, and
suffered more than any of them, am walking on foot to the house of
a woman of rather questionable reputation!"
"A man, look you, who has
thirteen bullets on his breast!..."
You don’t believe it?
"Well, I can
assure you it was entirely on my account that Pirogoff telegraphed
to Paris, and left Sebastopol at the greatest risk during the siege."
"Nelaton, the Tuileries surgeon, demanded a safe conduct, in the name
of science, into the besieged city in order to attend my wounds."
"The
government knows all about it."
"‘That’s the Ivolgin with thirteen bullets
in him!’ That’s how they speak of me.... Do you see that house, prince?"
"One of my old friends lives on the first floor, with his large family."
"In this and five other houses, three overlooking Nevsky, two in the
Morskaya, are all that remain of my personal friends."
"Nina Alexandrovna
gave them up long ago, but I keep in touch with them still..."
"I may
say I find refreshment in this little coterie, in thus meeting my old
acquaintances and subordinates, who worship me still, in spite of all."
"General Sokolovitch (by the way, I have not called on him lately, or
seen Anna Fedorovna)... You know, my dear prince, when a person does
not receive company himself, he gives up going to other people’s houses
involuntarily."
"And yet... well... you look as if you didn’t believe
me.... Well now, why should I not present the son of my old friend
and companion to this delightful family--General Ivolgin and Prince
Muishkin?"
You will see a lovely girl--what am I saying--a lovely girl?
"No, indeed, two, three!"
"Ornaments of this city and of society: beauty,
education, culture--the woman question--poetry--everything!"
"Added to
which is the fact that each one will have a dot of at least eighty
thousand roubles."
"No bad thing, eh?..."
"In a word I absolutely must
introduce you to them: it is a duty, an obligation."
"General Ivolgin and
Prince Muishkin."
"Tableau!”

“At once?"
Now?
You must have forgotten...” began the prince.
"“No, I have forgotten nothing."
Come!
"This is the house--up this
magnificent staircase."
"I am surprised not to see the porter, but .... it
is a holiday... and the man has gone off... Drunken fool!"
"Why have they
not got rid of him?"
"Sokolovitch owes all the happiness he has had in
the service and in his private life to me, and me alone, but... here we
are.”

The prince followed quietly, making no further objection for fear of
irritating the old man."
"At the same time he fervently hoped that General
Sokolovitch and his family would fade away like a mirage in the desert,
so that the visitors could escape, by merely returning downstairs."
"But
to his horror he saw that General Ivolgin was quite familiar with the
house, and really seemed to have friends there."
"At every step he named
some topographical or biographical detail that left nothing to be
desired on the score of accuracy."
"When they arrived at last, on the
first floor, and the general turned to ring the bell to the right,
the prince decided to run away, but a curious incident stopped him
momentarily."
"“You have made a mistake, general,” said he."
"“The name on the door is
Koulakoff, and you were going to see General Sokolovitch.”

“Koulakoff... Koulakoff means nothing."
"This is Sokolovitch’s flat, and
I am ringing at his door.... What do I care for Koulakoff?..."
"Here comes
someone to open.”

In fact, the door opened directly, and the footman informed the
visitors that the family were all away."
“What a pity!
What a pity!
"It’s just my luck!” repeated Ardalion
Alexandrovitch over and over again, in regretful tones."
"“When your
master and mistress return, my man, tell them that General Ivolgin
and Prince Muishkin desired to present themselves, and that they were
extremely sorry, excessively grieved...”

Just then another person belonging to the household was seen at the
back of the hall."
"It was a woman of some forty years, dressed in sombre
colours, probably a housekeeper or a governess."
"Hearing the names she
came forward with a look of suspicion on her face."
"“Marie Alexandrovna is not at home,” said she, staring hard at the
general."
"“She has gone to her mother’s, with Alexandra Michailovna.”

“Alexandra Michailovna out, too!"
How disappointing!
"Would you believe
it, I am always so unfortunate!"
"May I most respectfully ask you to
present my compliments to Alexandra Michailovna, and remind her... tell
her, that with my whole heart I wish for her what she wished for herself
on Thursday evening, while she was listening to Chopin’s Ballade."
"She
will remember."
I wish it with all sincerity.
"General Ivolgin and Prince
Muishkin!”

The woman’s face changed; she lost her suspicious expression."
"“I will not fail to deliver your message,” she replied, and bowed them
out."
"As they went downstairs the general regretted repeatedly that he had
failed to introduce the prince to his friends."
"“You know I am a bit of a poet,” said he."
“Have you noticed it?
"The
poetic soul, you know.” Then he added suddenly--“But after all...
after all I believe we made a mistake this time!"
"I remember that the
Sokolovitch’s live in another house, and what is more, they are just
now in Moscow."
"Yes, I certainly was at fault."
"However, it is of no
consequence.”

“Just tell me,” said the prince in reply, “may I count still on your
assistance?"
"Or shall I go on alone to see Nastasia Philipovna?”

“Count on my assistance?"
Go alone?
"How can you ask me that question,
when it is a matter on which the fate of my family so largely depends?"
"You don’t know Ivolgin, my friend."
"To trust Ivolgin is to trust a rock;
that’s how the first squadron I commanded spoke of me."
"‘Depend upon
Ivolgin,’ said they all, ‘he is as steady as a rock.’ But, excuse me,
I must just call at a house on our way, a house where I have found
consolation and help in all my trials for years.”

“You are going home?”

“No..."
"I wish... to visit Madame Terentieff, the widow of Captain
Terentieff, my old subordinate and friend."
"She helps me to keep up my
courage, and to bear the trials of my domestic life, and as I have an
extra burden on my mind today...”

“It seems to me,” interrupted the prince, “that I was foolish to trouble
you just now."
"However, at present you... Good-bye!”

“Indeed, you must not go away like that, young man, you must not!” cried
the general."
"“My friend here is a widow, the mother of a family; her
words come straight from her heart, and find an echo in mine."
"A visit
to her is merely an affair of a few minutes; I am quite at home in her
house."
"I will have a wash, and dress, and then we can drive to the Grand
Theatre."
"Make up your mind to spend the evening with me.... We are
just there--that’s the house... Why, Colia!"
you here!
"Well, is Marfa
Borisovna at home or have you only just come?”

“Oh no!"
"I have been here a long while,” replied Colia, who was at the
front door when the general met him."
“I am keeping Hippolyte company.
"He is worse, and has been in bed all day."
I came down to buy some cards.
Marfa Borisovna expects you.
"But what a state you are in, father!” added
the boy, noticing his father’s unsteady gait."
"“Well, let us go in.”

On meeting Colia the prince determined to accompany the general, though
he made up his mind to stay as short a time as possible."
"He wanted
Colia, but firmly resolved to leave the general behind."
"He could not
forgive himself for being so simple as to imagine that Ivolgin would be
of any use."
"The three climbed up the long staircase until they reached
the fourth floor where Madame Terentieff lived."
"“You intend to introduce the prince?” asked Colia, as they went up."
"“Yes, my boy."
"I wish to present him: General Ivolgin and Prince
Muishkin!"
But what’s the matter?...
what?...
"How is Marfa Borisovna?”

“You know, father, you would have done much better not to come at all!"
She is ready to eat you up!
"You have not shown yourself since the day
before yesterday and she is expecting the money."
"Why did you promise her
any?"
You are always the same!
"Well, now you will have to get out of it
as best you can.”

They stopped before a somewhat low doorway on the fourth floor."
"Ardalion
Alexandrovitch, evidently much out of countenance, pushed Muishkin in
front."
"“I will wait here,” he stammered."
“I should like to surprise her.
"....”

Colia entered first, and as the door stood open, the mistress of the
house peeped out."
"The surprise of the general’s imagination fell very
flat, for she at once began to address him in terms of reproach."
Marfa Borisovna was about forty years of age.
"She wore a
dressing-jacket, her feet were in slippers, her face painted, and her
hair was in dozens of small plaits."
"No sooner did she catch sight of
Ardalion Alexandrovitch than she screamed:

“There he is, that wicked, mean wretch!"
I knew it was he!
"My heart
misgave me!”

The old man tried to put a good face on the affair."
"“Come, let us go in--it’s all right,” he whispered in the prince’s ear."
But it was more serious than he wished to think.
"As soon as the visitors
had crossed the low dark hall, and entered the narrow reception-room,
furnished with half a dozen cane chairs, and two small card-tables,
Madame Terentieff, in the shrill tones habitual to her, continued her
stream of invectives."
“Are you not ashamed?
Are you not ashamed?
You barbarian!
You tyrant!
"You have robbed me of all I possessed--you have sucked my bones to the
marrow."
How long shall I be your victim?
"Shameless, dishonourable man!”

“Marfa Borisovna!"
Marfa Borisovna!
Here is... the Prince Muishkin!
"General Ivolgin and Prince Muishkin,” stammered the disconcerted old
man."
"“Would you believe,” said the mistress of the house, suddenly addressing
the prince, “would you believe that that man has not even spared my
orphan children?"
"He has stolen everything I possessed, sold everything,
pawned everything; he has left me nothing--nothing!"
"What am I to do with
your IOU’s, you cunning, unscrupulous rogue?"
"Answer, devourer!"
"answer,
heart of stone!"
How shall I feed my orphans?
"with what shall I nourish
them?"
"And now he has come, he is drunk!"
He can scarcely stand.
"How, oh
how, have I offended the Almighty, that He should bring this curse upon
me!"
"Answer, you worthless villain, answer!”

But this was too much for the general."
"“Here are twenty-five roubles, Marfa Borisovna... it is all that I
can give... and I owe even these to the prince’s generosity--my noble
friend."
I have been cruelly deceived.
Such is... life... Now...
"Excuse
me, I am very weak,” he continued, standing in the centre of the
room, and bowing to all sides."
“I am faint; excuse me!
"Lenotchka... a
cushion... my dear!”

Lenotchka, a little girl of eight, ran to fetch the cushion at once, and
placed it on the rickety old sofa."
"The general meant to have said much
more, but as soon as he had stretched himself out, he turned his face to
the wall, and slept the sleep of the just."
"With a grave and ceremonious air, Marfa Borisovna motioned the prince to
a chair at one of the card-tables."
"She seated herself opposite, leaned
her right cheek on her hand, and sat in silence, her eyes fixed on
Muishkin, now and again sighing deeply."
"The three children, two little
girls and a boy, Lenotchka being the eldest, came and leant on the
table and also stared steadily at him."
"Presently Colia appeared from the
adjoining room."
"“I am very glad indeed to have met you here, Colia,” said the prince."
“Can you do something for me?
"I must see Nastasia Philipovna, and I
asked Ardalion Alexandrovitch just now to take me to her house, but he
has gone to sleep, as you see."
"Will you show me the way, for I do not
know the street?"
"I have the address, though; it is close to the Grand
Theatre.”

“Nastasia Philipovna?"
"She does not live there, and to tell you the truth
my father has never been to her house!"
"It is strange that you should
have depended on him!"
"She lives near Wladimir Street, at the Five
Corners, and it is quite close by."
Will you go directly?
"It is just
half-past nine."
"I will show you the way with pleasure.”

Colia and the prince went off together."
Alas!
"the latter had no money to
pay for a cab, so they were obliged to walk."
"“I should have liked to have taken you to see Hippolyte,” said Colia."
"“He is the eldest son of the lady you met just now, and was in the next
room."
"He is ill, and has been in bed all day."
"But he is rather strange,
and extremely sensitive, and I thought he might be upset considering
the circumstances in which you came..."
"Somehow it touches me less, as
it concerns my father, while it is _his_ mother."
"That, of course, makes
a great difference."
"What is a terrible disgrace to a woman, does not
disgrace a man, at least not in the same way."
"Perhaps public opinion
is wrong in condemning one sex, and excusing the other."
"Hippolyte is
an extremely clever boy, but so prejudiced."
"He is really a slave to his
opinions.”

“Do you say he is consumptive?”

“Yes."
It really would be happier for him to die young.
"If I were in his
place I should certainly long for death."
"He is unhappy about his brother
and sisters, the children you saw."
"If it were possible, if we only had a
little money, we should leave our respective families, and live together
in a little apartment of our own."
It is our dream.
"But, do you know,
when I was talking over your affair with him, he was angry, and said
that anyone who did not call out a man who had given him a blow was a
coward."
"He is very irritable to-day, and I left off arguing the matter
with him."
"So Nastasia Philipovna has invited you to go and see her?”

“To tell the truth, she has not.”

“Then how do you come to be going there?” cried Colia, so much
astonished that he stopped short in the middle of the pavement."
"“And...
and are you going to her ‘At Home’ in that costume?”

“I don’t know, really, whether I shall be allowed in at all."
"If she will
receive me, so much the better."
"If not, the matter is ended."
"As to my
clothes--what can I do?”

“Are you going there for some particular reason, or only as a way of
getting into her society, and that of her friends?”

“No, I have really an object in going... That is, I am going on business
it is difficult to explain, but...”

“Well, whether you go on business or not is your affair, I do not want
to know."
"The only important thing, in my eyes, is that you should not
be going there simply for the pleasure of spending your evening in such
company--cocottes, generals, usurers!"
"If that were the case I should
despise and laugh at you."
"There are terribly few honest people here,
and hardly any whom one can respect, although people put on airs--Varia
especially!"
"Have you noticed, prince, how many adventurers there are
nowadays?"
"Especially here, in our dear Russia."
"How it has happened I
never can understand."
"There used to be a certain amount of solidity in
all things, but now what happens?"
"Everything is exposed to the public
gaze, veils are thrown back, every wound is probed by careless fingers."
We are for ever present at an orgy of scandalous revelations.
"Parents
blush when they remember their old-fashioned morality."
"At Moscow lately
a father was heard urging his son to stop at nothing--at nothing, mind
you!--to get money!"
"The press seized upon the story, of course, and now
it is public property."
"Look at my father, the general!"
"See what he is,
and yet, I assure you, he is an honest man!"
"Only... he drinks too much,
and his morals are not all we could desire."
"Yes, that’s true!"
"I pity
him, to tell the truth, but I dare not say so, because everybody would
laugh at me--but I do pity him!"
"And who are the really clever men, after
all?"
"Money-grubbers, every one of them, from the first to the last."
"Hippolyte finds excuses for money-lending, and says it is a necessity."
"He talks about the economic movement, and the ebb and flow of capital;
the devil knows what he means."
"It makes me angry to hear him talk so,
but he is soured by his troubles."
"Just imagine--the general keeps his
mother--but she lends him money!"
"She lends it for a week or ten days
at very high interest!"
Isn’t it disgusting?
"And then, you would hardly
believe it, but my mother--Nina Alexandrovna--helps Hippolyte in all
sorts of ways, sends him money and clothes."
"She even goes as far as
helping the children, through Hippolyte, because their mother cares
nothing about them, and Varia does the same.”

“Well, just now you said there were no honest nor good people about,
that there were only money-grubbers--and here they are quite close at
hand, these honest and good people, your mother and Varia!"
"I think
there is a good deal of moral strength in helping people in such
circumstances.”

“Varia does it from pride, and likes showing off, and giving herself
airs."
"As to my mother, I really do admire her--yes, and honour her."
"Hippolyte, hardened as he is, feels it."
"He laughed at first, and thought
it vulgar of her--but now, he is sometimes quite touched and overcome by
her kindness."
H’m!
You call that being strong and good?
"I will remember
that!"
Gania knows nothing about it.
"He would say that it was encouraging
vice.”

“Ah, Gania knows nothing about it?"
"It seems there are many things that
Gania does not know,” exclaimed the prince, as he considered Colia’s
last words."
"“Do you know, I like you very much indeed, prince?"
"I shall never forget
about this afternoon.”

“I like you too, Colia.”

“Listen to me!"
"You are going to live here, are you not?” said Colia."
"“I mean to get something to do directly, and earn money."
"Then shall we
three live together?"
"You, and I, and Hippolyte?"
"We will hire a flat, and
let the general come and visit us."
"What do you say?”

“It would be very pleasant,” returned the prince."
“But we must see.
"I am
really rather worried just now."
What!
are we there already?
"Is that the
house?"
What a long flight of steps!
And there’s a porter!
"Well, Colia I
don’t know what will come of it all.”

The prince seemed quite distracted for the moment."
“You must tell me all about it tomorrow!
Don’t be afraid.
"I wish you
success; we agree so entirely that I can do so, although I do not
understand why you are here."
Good-bye!” cried Colia excitedly.
"“Now I
will rush back and tell Hippolyte all about our plans and proposals!"
"But
as to your getting in--don’t be in the least afraid."
You will see her.
She is so original about everything.
It’s the first floor.
"The porter
will show you.”

XIII."
"The prince was very nervous as he reached the outer door; but he did his
best to encourage himself with the reflection that the worst thing that
could happen to him would be that he would not be received, or, perhaps,
received, then laughed at for coming."
"But there was another question, which terrified him considerably,
and that was: what was he going to do when he _did_ get in?"
"And to this
question he could fashion no satisfactory reply."
"If only he could find an opportunity of coming close up to Nastasia
Philipovna and saying to her: “Don’t ruin yourself by marrying this man."
"He does not love you, he only loves your money."
"He told me so himself,
and so did Aglaya Ivanovna, and I have come on purpose to warn you”--but
even that did not seem quite a legitimate or practicable thing to do."
"Then, again, there was another delicate question, to which he could not
find an answer; dared not, in fact, think of it; but at the very idea
of which he trembled and blushed."
"However, in spite of all his fears and
heart-quakings he went in, and asked for Nastasia Philipovna."
"Nastasia occupied a medium-sized, but distinctly tasteful, flat,
beautifully furnished and arranged."
"At one period of these five years
of Petersburg life, Totski had certainly not spared his expenditure upon
her."
"He had calculated upon her eventual love, and tried to tempt her
with a lavish outlay upon comforts and luxuries, knowing too well how
easily the heart accustoms itself to comforts, and how difficult it is
to tear one’s self away from luxuries which have become habitual and,
little by little, indispensable."
"Nastasia did not reject all this, she even loved her comforts and
luxuries, but, strangely enough, never became, in the least degree,
dependent upon them, and always gave the impression that she could do
just as well without them."
"In fact, she went so far as to inform Totski
on several occasions that such was the case, which the latter gentleman
considered a very unpleasant communication indeed."
"But, of late, Totski had observed many strange and original features
and characteristics in Nastasia, which he had neither known nor reckoned
upon in former times, and some of these fascinated him, even now, in
spite of the fact that all his old calculations with regard to her were
long ago cast to the winds."
"A maid opened the door for the prince (Nastasia’s servants were all
females) and, to his surprise, received his request to announce him to
her mistress without any astonishment."
"Neither his dirty boots, nor his
wide-brimmed hat, nor his sleeveless cloak, nor his evident confusion of
manner, produced the least impression upon her."
"She helped him off with
his cloak, and begged him to wait a moment in the ante-room while she
announced him."
"The company assembled at Nastasia Philipovna’s consisted of none but her
most intimate friends, and formed a very small party in comparison with
her usual gatherings on this anniversary."
"In the first place there were present Totski, and General Epanchin."
"They were both highly amiable, but both appeared to be labouring under
a half-hidden feeling of anxiety as to the result of Nastasia’s
deliberations with regard to Gania, which result was to be made public
this evening."
"Then, of course, there was Gania who was by no means so amiable as
his elders, but stood apart, gloomy, and miserable, and silent."
"He had
determined not to bring Varia with him; but Nastasia had not even asked
after her, though no sooner had he arrived than she had reminded him of
the episode between himself and the prince."
"The general, who had heard
nothing of it before, began to listen with some interest, while Gania,
drily, but with perfect candour, went through the whole history,
including the fact of his apology to the prince."
"He finished by
declaring that the prince was a most extraordinary man, and goodness
knows why he had been considered an idiot hitherto, for he was very far
from being one."
"Nastasia listened to all this with great interest; but the conversation
soon turned to Rogojin and his visit, and this theme proved of the
greatest attraction to both Totski and the general."
"Ptitsin was able to afford some particulars as to Rogojin’s conduct
since the afternoon."
"He declared that he had been busy finding money for
the latter ever since, and up to nine o’clock, Rogojin having declared
that he must absolutely have a hundred thousand roubles by the evening."
"He added that Rogojin was drunk, of course; but that he thought the
money would be forthcoming, for the excited and intoxicated rapture of
the fellow impelled him to give any interest or premium that was asked
of him, and there were several others engaged in beating up the money,
also."
All this news was received by the company with somewhat gloomy interest.
"Nastasia was silent, and would not say what she thought about it."
"Gania
was equally uncommunicative."
"The general seemed the most anxious of all,
and decidedly uneasy."
"The present of pearls which he had prepared with
so much joy in the morning had been accepted but coldly, and Nastasia
had smiled rather disagreeably as she took it from him."
"Ferdishenko was
the only person present in good spirits."
"Totski himself, who had the reputation of being a capital talker, and
was usually the life and soul of these entertainments, was as silent
as any on this occasion, and sat in a state of, for him, most uncommon
perturbation."
"The rest of the guests (an old tutor or schoolmaster, goodness knows
why invited; a young man, very timid, and shy and silent; a rather
loud woman of about forty, apparently an actress; and a very pretty,
well-dressed German lady who hardly said a word all the evening) not
only had no gift for enlivening the proceedings, but hardly knew what to
say for themselves when addressed."
"Under these circumstances the arrival
of the prince came almost as a godsend."
"The announcement of his name gave rise to some surprise and to some
smiles, especially when it became evident, from Nastasia’s astonished
look, that she had not thought of inviting him."
"But her astonishment
once over, Nastasia showed such satisfaction that all prepared to greet
the prince with cordial smiles of welcome."
"“Of course,” remarked General Epanchin, “he does this out of pure
innocence."
"It’s a little dangerous, perhaps, to encourage this sort of
freedom; but it is rather a good thing that he has arrived just at this
moment."
"He may enliven us a little with his originalities.”

“Especially as he asked himself,” said Ferdishenko."
"“What’s that got to do with it?” asked the general, who loathed
Ferdishenko."
"“Why, he must pay toll for his entrance,” explained the latter."
“H’m!
"Prince Muishkin is not Ferdishenko,” said the general,
impatiently."
"This worthy gentleman could never quite reconcile himself
to the idea of meeting Ferdishenko in society, and on an equal footing."
"“Oh general, spare Ferdishenko!” replied the other, smiling."
"“I have
special privileges.”

“What do you mean by special privileges?”

“Once before I had the honour of stating them to the company."
"I will
repeat the explanation to-day for your excellency’s benefit."
"You see,
excellency, all the world is witty and clever except myself."
"I am
neither."
"As a kind of compensation I am allowed to tell the truth, for
it is a well-known fact that only stupid people tell ‘the truth.’ Added
to this, I am a spiteful man, just because I am not clever."
"If I am
offended or injured I bear it quite patiently until the man injuring
me meets with some misfortune."
"Then I remember, and take my revenge."
"I
return the injury sevenfold, as Ivan Petrovitch Ptitsin says."
"(Of course
he never does so himself.)"
"Excellency, no doubt you recollect Kryloff’s
fable, ‘The Lion and the Ass’?"
"Well now, that’s you and I."
"That fable
was written precisely for us.”

“You seem to be talking nonsense again, Ferdishenko,” growled the
general."
"“What is the matter, excellency?"
I know how to keep my place.
"When I
said just now that we, you and I, were the lion and the ass of Kryloff’s
fable, of course it is understood that I take the role of the ass."
"Your
excellency is the lion of which the fable remarks:

  ‘A mighty lion, terror of the woods,
   Was shorn of his great prowess by old age.’

And I, your excellency, am the ass.”

“I am of your opinion on that last point,” said Ivan Fedorovitch, with
ill-concealed irritation."
"All this was no doubt extremely coarse, and moreover it was
premeditated, but after all Ferdishenko had persuaded everyone to accept
him as a buffoon."
"“If I am admitted and tolerated here,” he had said one day, “it is
simply because I talk in this way."
"How can anyone possibly receive
such a man as I am?"
I quite understand.
"Now, could I, a Ferdishenko,
be allowed to sit shoulder to shoulder with a clever man like Afanasy
Ivanovitch?"
"There is one explanation, only one."
"I am given the position
because it is so entirely inconceivable!”

But these vulgarities seemed to please Nastasia Philipovna, although too
often they were both rude and offensive."
"Those who wished to go to her
house were forced to put up with Ferdishenko."
"Possibly the latter was
not mistaken in imagining that he was received simply in order to annoy
Totski, who disliked him extremely."
"Gania also was often made the butt
of the jester’s sarcasms, who used this method of keeping in Nastasia
Philipovna’s good graces."
"“The prince will begin by singing us a fashionable ditty,” remarked
Ferdishenko, and looked at the mistress of the house, to see what she
would say."
"“I don’t think so, Ferdishenko; please be quiet,” answered Nastasia
Philipovna dryly."
“A-ah!
"if he is to be under special patronage, I withdraw my claws.”

But Nastasia Philipovna had now risen and advanced to meet the prince."
"“I was so sorry to have forgotten to ask you to come, when I saw you,”
 she said, “and I am delighted to be able to thank you personally now,
and to express my pleasure at your resolution.”

So saying she gazed into his eyes, longing to see whether she could make
any guess as to the explanation of his motive in coming to her house."
"The prince would very likely have made some reply to her kind words, but
he was so dazzled by her appearance that he could not speak."
Nastasia noticed this with satisfaction.
"She was in full dress this
evening; and her appearance was certainly calculated to impress all
beholders."
She took his hand and led him towards her other guests.
"But
just before they reached the drawing-room door, the prince stopped her,
and hurriedly and in great agitation whispered to her:

“You are altogether perfection; even your pallor and thinness are
perfect; one could not wish you otherwise."
"I did so wish to come and see
you."
"I--forgive me, please--”

“Don’t apologize,” said Nastasia, laughing; “you spoil the whole
originality of the thing."
"I think what they say about you must be true,
that you are so original.--So you think me perfection, do you?”

“Yes.”

“H’m!"
"Well, you may be a good reader of riddles but you are wrong
_there_, at all events."
"I’ll remind you of this, tonight.”

Nastasia introduced the prince to her guests, to most of whom he was
already known."
Totski immediately made some amiable remark.
"All seemed to brighten up at
once, and the conversation became general."
"Nastasia made the prince sit
down next to herself."
"“Dear me, there’s nothing so very curious about the prince dropping in,
after all,” remarked Ferdishenko."
"“It’s quite a clear case,” said the hitherto silent Gania."
"“I have
watched the prince almost all day, ever since the moment when he first
saw Nastasia Philipovna’s portrait, at General Epanchin’s."
"I remember
thinking at the time what I am now pretty sure of; and what, I may say
in passing, the prince confessed to myself.”

Gania said all this perfectly seriously, and without the slightest
appearance of joking; indeed, he seemed strangely gloomy."
"“I did not confess anything to you,” said the prince, blushing."
"“I only
answered your question.”

“Bravo!"
"That’s frank, at any rate!” shouted Ferdishenko, and there was
general laughter."
"“Oh prince, prince!"
"I never should have thought it of you;” said General
Epanchin."
“And I imagined you a philosopher!
"Oh, you silent fellows!”

“Judging from the fact that the prince blushed at this innocent joke,
like a young girl, I should think that he must, as an honourable man,
harbour the noblest intentions,” said the old toothless schoolmaster,
most unexpectedly; he had not so much as opened his mouth before."
"This remark provoked general mirth, and the old fellow himself laughed
loudest of the lot, but ended with a stupendous fit of coughing."
"Nastasia Philipovna, who loved originality and drollery of all kinds,
was apparently very fond of this old man, and rang the bell for more tea
to stop his coughing."
It was now half-past ten o’clock.
"“Gentlemen, wouldn’t you like a little champagne now?” she asked."
"“I
have it all ready; it will cheer us up--do now--no ceremony!”

This invitation to drink, couched, as it was, in such informal terms,
came very strangely from Nastasia Philipovna."
"Her usual entertainments
were not quite like this; there was more style about them."
"However, the
wine was not refused; each guest took a glass excepting Gania, who drank
nothing."
"It was extremely difficult to account for Nastasia’s strange condition
of mind, which became more evident each moment, and which none could
avoid noticing."
"She took her glass, and vowed she would empty it three times that
evening."
"She was hysterical, and laughed aloud every other minute
with no apparent reason--the next moment relapsing into gloom and
thoughtfulness."
"Some of her guests suspected that she must be ill; but concluded at last
that she was expecting something, for she continued to look at her watch
impatiently and unceasingly; she was most absent and strange."
"“You seem to be a little feverish tonight,” said the actress."
“Yes; I feel quite ill.
"I have been obliged to put on this shawl--I feel
so cold,” replied Nastasia."
"She certainly had grown very pale, and every
now and then she tried to suppress a trembling in her limbs."
"“Had we not better allow our hostess to retire?” asked Totski of the
general."
"“Not at all, gentlemen, not at all!"
"Your presence is absolutely
necessary to me tonight,” said Nastasia, significantly."
"As most of those present were aware that this evening a certain very
important decision was to be taken, these words of Nastasia Philipovna’s
appeared to be fraught with much hidden interest."
"The general and Totski
exchanged looks; Gania fidgeted convulsively in his chair."
“Let’s play at some game!” suggested the actress.
"“I know a new and most delightful game, added Ferdishenko."
“What is it?” asked the actress.
"“Well, when we tried it we were a party of people, like this, for
instance; and somebody proposed that each of us, without leaving his
place at the table, should relate something about himself."
"It had to be
something that he really and honestly considered the very worst action
he had ever committed in his life."
"But he was to be honest--that was the
chief point!"
"He wasn’t to be allowed to lie.”

“What an extraordinary idea!” said the general."
"“That’s the beauty of it, general!”

“It’s a funny notion,” said Totski, “and yet quite natural--it’s only a
new way of boasting.”

“Perhaps that is just what was so fascinating about it.”

“Why, it would be a game to cry over--not to laugh at!” said the
actress."
“Did it succeed?” asked Nastasia Philipovna.
"“Come, let’s try it, let’s
try it; we really are not quite so jolly as we might be--let’s try it!"
"We may like it; it’s original, at all events!”

“Yes,” said Ferdishenko; “it’s a good idea--come along--the men begin."
Of course no one need tell a story if he prefers to be disobliging.
"We
must draw lots!"
"Throw your slips of paper, gentlemen, into this hat, and
the prince shall draw for turns."
"It’s a very simple game; all you have
to do is to tell the story of the worst action of your life."
"It’s as
simple as anything."
"I’ll prompt anyone who forgets the rules!”

No one liked the idea much."
"Some smiled, some frowned; some objected,
but faintly, not wishing to oppose Nastasia’s wishes; for this new idea
seemed to be rather well received by her."
"She was still in an excited,
hysterical state, laughing convulsively at nothing and everything."
"Her
eyes were blazing, and her cheeks showed two bright red spots against
the white."
"The melancholy appearance of some of her guests seemed to add
to her sarcastic humour, and perhaps the very cynicism and cruelty of
the game proposed by Ferdishenko pleased her."
"At all events she was
attracted by the idea, and gradually her guests came round to her side;
the thing was original, at least, and might turn out to be amusing."
"“And
supposing it’s something that one--one can’t speak about before ladies?”
 asked the timid and silent young man."
"“Why, then of course, you won’t say anything about it."
"As if there
are not plenty of sins to your score without the need of those!” said
Ferdishenko."
"“But I really don’t know which of my actions is the worst,” said the
lively actress."
"“Ladies are exempted if they like.”

“And how are you to know that one isn’t lying?"
"And if one lies the whole
point of the game is lost,” said Gania."
"“Oh, but think how delightful to hear how one’s friends lie!"
"Besides
you needn’t be afraid, Gania; everybody knows what your worst action is
without the need of any lying on your part."
"Only think, gentlemen,”--and
Ferdishenko here grew quite enthusiastic, “only think with what eyes we
shall observe one another tomorrow, after our tales have been told!”

“But surely this is a joke, Nastasia Philipovna?” asked Totski."
"“You
don’t really mean us to play this game.”

“Whoever is afraid of wolves had better not go into the wood,” said
Nastasia, smiling."
"“But, pardon me, Mr. Ferdishenko, is it possible to make a game out of
this kind of thing?” persisted Totski, growing more and more uneasy."
"“I
assure you it can’t be a success.”

“And why not?"
"Why, the last time I simply told straight off about how I
stole three roubles.”

“Perhaps so; but it is hardly possible that you told it so that it
seemed like truth, or so that you were believed."
"And, as Gavrila
Ardalionovitch has said, the least suggestion of a falsehood takes all
point out of the game."
"It seems to me that sincerity, on the other hand,
is only possible if combined with a kind of bad taste that would be
utterly out of place here.”

“How subtle you are, Afanasy Ivanovitch!"
"You astonish me,” cried
Ferdishenko."
"“You will remark, gentlemen, that in saying that I
could not recount the story of my theft so as to be believed, Afanasy
Ivanovitch has very ingeniously implied that I am not capable of
thieving--(it would have been bad taste to say so openly); and all the
time he is probably firmly convinced, in his own mind, that I am very
well capable of it!"
"But now, gentlemen, to business!"
"Put in your slips,
ladies and gentlemen--is yours in, Mr. Totski?"
"So--then we are all
ready; now prince, draw, please.” The prince silently put his hand into
the hat, and drew the names."
"Ferdishenko was first, then Ptitsin, then
the general, Totski next, his own fifth, then Gania, and so on; the
ladies did not draw."
"“Oh, dear!"
"oh, dear!” cried Ferdishenko."
"“I did so hope the prince would
come out first, and then the general."
"Well, gentlemen, I suppose I
must set a good example!"
"What vexes me much is that I am such an
insignificant creature that it matters nothing to anybody whether I have
done bad actions or not!"
"Besides, which am I to choose?"
"It’s an _embarras
de richesse_."
"Shall I tell how I became a thief on one occasion only, to
convince Afanasy Ivanovitch that it is possible to steal without being a
thief?”

“Do go on, Ferdishenko, and don’t make unnecessary preface, or you’ll
never finish,” said Nastasia Philipovna."
"All observed how irritable and
cross she had become since her last burst of laughter; but none the less
obstinately did she stick to her absurd whim about this new game."
"Totski
sat looking miserable enough."
"The general lingered over his champagne,
and seemed to be thinking of some story for the time when his turn
should come."
XIV.
"“I have no wit, Nastasia Philipovna,” began Ferdishenko, “and therefore
I talk too much, perhaps."
"Were I as witty, now, as Mr. Totski or the
general, I should probably have sat silent all the evening, as they
have."
"Now, prince, what do you think?--are there not far more thieves
than honest men in this world?"
"Don’t you think we may say there does
not exist a single person so honest that he has never stolen anything
whatever in his life?”

“What a silly idea,” said the actress."
“Of course it is not the case.
"I
have never stolen anything, for one.”

“H’m!"
"very well, Daria Alexeyevna; you have not stolen anything--agreed."
"But how about the prince, now--look how he is blushing!”

“I think you are partially right, but you exaggerate,” said the prince,
who had certainly blushed up, of a sudden, for some reason or other."
"“Ferdishenko--either tell us your story, or be quiet, and mind your own
business."
"You exhaust all patience,” cuttingly and irritably remarked
Nastasia Philipovna."
"“Immediately, immediately!"
"As for my story, gentlemen, it is too stupid
and absurd to tell you."
"“I assure you I am not a thief, and yet I have stolen; I cannot explain
why."
"It was at Semeon Ivanovitch Ishenka’s country house, one Sunday."
"He
had a dinner party."
"After dinner the men stayed at the table over their
wine."
"It struck me to ask the daughter of the house to play something
on the piano; so I passed through the corner room to join the ladies."
"In
that room, on Maria Ivanovna’s writing-table, I observed a three-rouble
note."
"She must have taken it out for some purpose, and left it lying
there."
There was no one about.
"I took up the note and put it in my
pocket; why, I can’t say."
"I don’t know what possessed me to do it, but
it was done, and I went quickly back to the dining-room and reseated
myself at the dinner-table."
"I sat and waited there in a great state of
excitement."
"I talked hard, and told lots of stories, and laughed like
mad; then I joined the ladies."
"“In half an hour or so the loss was discovered, and the servants were
being put under examination."
"Daria, the housemaid was suspected."
"I
exhibited the greatest interest and sympathy, and I remember that
poor Daria quite lost her head, and that I began assuring her, before
everyone, that I would guarantee her forgiveness on the part of her
mistress, if she would confess her guilt."
"They all stared at the girl,
and I remember a wonderful attraction in the reflection that here was I
sermonizing away, with the money in my own pocket all the while."
"I went
and spent the three roubles that very evening at a restaurant."
"I went in
and asked for a bottle of Lafite, and drank it up; I wanted to be rid of
the money."
"“I did not feel much remorse either then or afterwards; but I would not
repeat the performance--believe it or not as you please."
"There--that’s
all.”

“Only, of course that’s not nearly your worst action,” said the actress,
with evident dislike in her face."
"“That was a psychological phenomenon, not an action,” remarked Totski."
"“And what about the maid?” asked Nastasia Philipovna, with undisguised
contempt."
"“Oh, she was turned out next day, of course."
"It’s a very strict
household, there!”

“And you allowed it?”

“I should think so, rather!"
"I was not going to return and confess
next day,” laughed Ferdishenko, who seemed a little surprised at the
disagreeable impression which his story had made on all parties."
“How mean you were!” said Nastasia.
“Bah!
"you wish to hear a man tell of his worst actions, and you expect
the story to come out goody-goody!"
One’s worst actions always are mean.
We shall see what the general has to say for himself now.
"All is not
gold that glitters, you know; and because a man keeps his carriage he
need not be specially virtuous, I assure you, all sorts of people keep
carriages."
"And by what means?”

In a word, Ferdishenko was very angry and rapidly forgetting himself;
his whole face was drawn with passion."
"Strange as it may appear, he had
expected much better success for his story."
"These little errors of taste
on Ferdishenko’s part occurred very frequently."
"Nastasia trembled with
rage, and looked fixedly at him, whereupon he relapsed into alarmed
silence."
He realized that he had gone a little too far.
“Had we not better end this game?” asked Totski.
"“It’s my turn, but I plead exemption,” said Ptitsin."
“You don’t care to oblige us?” asked Nastasia.
"“I cannot, I assure you."
"I confess I do not understand how anyone can
play this game.”

“Then, general, it’s your turn,” continued Nastasia Philipovna, “and if
you refuse, the whole game will fall through, which will disappoint me
very much, for I was looking forward to relating a certain ‘page of my
own life.’ I am only waiting for you and Afanasy Ivanovitch to have your
turns, for I require the support of your example,” she added, smiling."
"“Oh, if you put it in that way,” cried the general, excitedly, “I’m
ready to tell the whole story of my life, but I must confess that I
prepared a little story in anticipation of my turn.”

Nastasia smiled amiably at him; but evidently her depression and
irritability were increasing with every moment."
"Totski was dreadfully
alarmed to hear her promise a revelation out of her own life."
"“I, like everyone else,” began the general, “have committed certain not
altogether graceful actions, so to speak, during the course of my life."
"But the strangest thing of all in my case is, that I should consider the
little anecdote which I am now about to give you as a confession of
the worst of my ‘bad actions.’ It is thirty-five years since it all
happened, and yet I cannot to this very day recall the circumstances
without, as it were, a sudden pang at the heart."
“It was a silly affair--I was an ensign at the time.
"You know
ensigns--their blood is boiling water, their circumstances generally
penurious."
"Well, I had a servant Nikifor who used to do everything for
me in my quarters, economized and managed for me, and even laid hands on
anything he could find (belonging to other people), in order to augment
our household goods; but a faithful, honest fellow all the same."
"“I was strict, but just by nature."
"At that time we were stationed in
a small town."
"I was quartered at an old widow’s house, a lieutenant’s
widow of eighty years of age."
"She lived in a wretched little wooden
house, and had not even a servant, so poor was she."
"“Her relations had all died off--her husband was dead and buried forty
years since; and a niece, who had lived with her and bullied her up to
three years ago, was dead too; so that she was quite alone."
"“Well, I was precious dull with her, especially as she was so childish
that there was nothing to be got out of her."
"Eventually, she stole a
fowl of mine; the business is a mystery to this day; but it could have
been no one but herself."
"I requested to be quartered somewhere else,
and was shifted to the other end of the town, to the house of a merchant
with a large family, and a long beard, as I remember him."
"Nikifor and I
were delighted to go; but the old lady was not pleased at our departure."
"“Well, a day or two afterwards, when I returned from drill, Nikifor
says to me: ‘We oughtn’t to have left our tureen with the old lady, I’ve
nothing to serve the soup in.’

“I asked how it came about that the tureen had been left."
"Nikifor
explained that the old lady refused to give it up, because, she said,
we had broken her bowl, and she must have our tureen in place of it; she
had declared that I had so arranged the matter with herself."
"“This baseness on her part of course aroused my young blood to fever
heat; I jumped up, and away I flew."
“I arrived at the old woman’s house beside myself.
"She was sitting in
a corner all alone, leaning her face on her hand."
"I fell on her like a
clap of thunder."
"‘You old wretch!’ I yelled and all that sort of thing,
in real Russian style."
"Well, when I began cursing at her, a strange
thing happened."
"I looked at her, and she stared back with her eyes
starting out of her head, but she did not say a word."
"She seemed to
sway about as she sat, and looked and looked at me in the strangest
way."
"Well, I soon stopped swearing and looked closer at her, asked her
questions, but not a word could I get out of her."
"The flies were buzzing
about the room and only this sound broke the silence; the sun was
setting outside; I didn’t know what to make of it, so I went away."
"“Before I reached home I was met and summoned to the major’s, so that it
was some while before I actually got there."
"When I came in, Nikifor met
me."
"‘Have you heard, sir, that our old lady is dead?’ ‘_dead_, when?’ ‘Oh,
an hour and a half ago.’ That meant nothing more nor less than that she
was dying at the moment when I pounced on her and began abusing her."
“This produced a great effect upon me.
"I used to dream of the poor old
woman at nights."
"I really am not superstitious, but two days after, I
went to her funeral, and as time went on I thought more and more about
her."
"I said to myself, ‘This woman, this human being, lived to a great
age."
"She had children, a husband and family, friends and relations; her
household was busy and cheerful; she was surrounded by smiling faces;
and then suddenly they are gone, and she is left alone like a solitary
fly... like a fly, cursed with the burden of her age."
"At last, God calls
her to Himself."
"At sunset, on a lovely summer’s evening, my little old
woman passes away--a thought, you will notice, which offers much food
for reflection--and behold!"
"instead of tears and prayers to start her
on her last journey, she has insults and jeers from a young ensign, who
stands before her with his hands in his pockets, making a terrible row
about a soup tureen!’ Of course I was to blame, and even now that I have
time to look back at it calmly, I pity the poor old thing no less."
"I repeat that I wonder at myself, for after all I was not really
responsible."
Why did she take it into her head to die at that moment?
"But the more I thought of it, the more I felt the weight of it upon my
mind; and I never got quite rid of the impression until I put a couple
of old women into an almshouse and kept them there at my own expense."
"There, that’s all."
"I repeat I dare say I have committed many a grievous
sin in my day; but I cannot help always looking back upon this as the
worst action I have ever perpetrated.”

“H’m!"
"and instead of a bad action, your excellency has detailed one of
your noblest deeds,” said Ferdishenko."
"“Ferdishenko is ‘done.’”

“Dear me, general,” said Nastasia Philipovna, absently, “I really never
imagined you had such a good heart.”

The general laughed with great satisfaction, and applied himself once
more to the champagne."
"It was now Totski’s turn, and his story was awaited with great
curiosity--while all eyes turned on Nastasia Philipovna, as though
anticipating that his revelation must be connected somehow with her."
"Nastasia, during the whole of his story, pulled at the lace trimming of
her sleeve, and never once glanced at the speaker."
"Totski was a handsome
man, rather stout, with a very polite and dignified manner."
"He was
always well dressed, and his linen was exquisite."
"He had plump white
hands, and wore a magnificent diamond ring on one finger."
"“What simplifies the duty before me considerably, in my opinion,” he
began, “is that I am bound to recall and relate the very worst action of
my life."
"In such circumstances there can, of course, be no doubt."
"One’s
conscience very soon informs one what is the proper narrative to tell."
"I
admit, that among the many silly and thoughtless actions of my life, the
memory of one comes prominently forward and reminds me that it lay long
like a stone on my heart."
"Some twenty years since, I paid a visit to
Platon Ordintzeff at his country-house."
"He had just been elected marshal
of the nobility, and had come there with his young wife for the winter
holidays."
"Anfisa Alexeyevna’s birthday came off just then, too, and
there were two balls arranged."
"At that time Dumas-fils’ beautiful work,
_La Dame aux Camélias_--a novel which I consider imperishable--had just
come into fashion."
"In the provinces all the ladies were in raptures over
it, those who had read it, at least."
Camellias were all the fashion.
"Everyone inquired for them, everybody wanted them; and a grand lot of
camellias are to be got in a country town--as you all know--and two
balls to provide for!"
“Poor Peter Volhofskoi was desperately in love with Anfisa Alexeyevna.
"I don’t know whether there was anything--I mean I don’t know whether
he could possibly have indulged in any hope."
"The poor fellow was beside
himself to get her a bouquet of camellias."
"Countess Sotski and Sophia
Bespalova, as everyone knew, were coming with white camellia bouquets."
"Anfisa wished for red ones, for effect."
"Well, her husband Platon was
driven desperate to find some."
"And the day before the ball, Anfisa’s
rival snapped up the only red camellias to be had in the place, from
under Platon’s nose, and Platon--wretched man--was done for."
"Now if
Peter had only been able to step in at this moment with a red bouquet,
his little hopes might have made gigantic strides."
"A woman’s gratitude
under such circumstances would have been boundless--but it was
practically an impossibility."
"“The night before the ball I met Peter, looking radiant."
"‘What is it?’
I ask."
"‘I’ve found them, Eureka!’ ‘No!"
"where, where?’ ‘At Ekshaisk (a
little town fifteen miles off) there’s a rich old merchant, who keeps
a lot of canaries, has no children, and he and his wife are devoted to
flowers."
"He’s got some camellias.’ ‘And what if he won’t let you have
them?’ ‘I’ll go on my knees and implore till I get them."
"I won’t go
away.’ ‘When shall you start?’ ‘Tomorrow morning at five o’clock.’ ‘Go
on,’ I said, ‘and good luck to you.’

“I was glad for the poor fellow, and went home."
"But an idea got hold of
me somehow."
I don’t know how.
It was nearly two in the morning.
"I rang
the bell and ordered the coachman to be waked up and sent to me."
"He
came."
"I gave him a tip of fifteen roubles, and told him to get the
carriage ready at once."
In half an hour it was at the door.
"I got in and
off we went."
“By five I drew up at the Ekshaisky inn.
"I waited there till dawn, and
soon after six I was off, and at the old merchant Trepalaf’s."
"“‘Camellias!’ I said, ‘father, save me, save me, let me have some
camellias!’ He was a tall, grey old man--a terrible-looking old
gentleman."
"‘Not a bit of it,’ he says."
"‘I won’t.’ Down I went on my
knees."
"‘Don’t say so, don’t--think what you’re doing!’ I cried; ‘it’s a
matter of life and death!’ ‘If that’s the case, take them,’ says he."
"So up I get, and cut such a bouquet of red camellias!"
"He had a whole
greenhouse full of them--lovely ones."
The old fellow sighs.
"I pull out a
hundred roubles."
"‘No, no!’ says he, ‘don’t insult me that way.’ ‘Oh, if
that’s the case, give it to the village hospital,’ I say."
"‘Ah,’ he says,
‘that’s quite a different matter; that’s good of you and generous."
"I’ll
pay it in there for you with pleasure.’ I liked that old fellow, Russian
to the core, _de la vraie souche_."
"I went home in raptures, but took
another road in order to avoid Peter."
"Immediately on arriving I sent up
the bouquet for Anfisa to see when she awoke."
"“You may imagine her ecstasy, her gratitude."
"The wretched Platon, who
had almost died since yesterday of the reproaches showered upon him,
wept on my shoulder."
Of course poor Peter had no chance after this.
"“I thought he would cut my throat at first, and went about armed ready
to meet him."
"But he took it differently; he fainted, and had brain fever
and convulsions."
"A month after, when he had hardly recovered, he went
off to the Crimea, and there he was shot."
“I assure you this business left me no peace for many a long year.
"Why
did I do it?"
"I was not in love with her myself; I’m afraid it was simply
mischief--pure ‘cussedness’ on my part."
"“If I hadn’t seized that bouquet from under his nose he might have been
alive now, and a happy man."
"He might have been successful in life, and
never have gone to fight the Turks.”

Totski ended his tale with the same dignity that had characterized its
commencement."
"Nastasia Philipovna’s eyes were flashing in a most unmistakable way,
now; and her lips were all a-quiver by the time Totski finished his
story."
All present watched both of them with curiosity.
"“You were right, Totski,” said Nastasia, “it is a dull game and a stupid
one."
"I’ll just tell my story, as I promised, and then we’ll play cards.”

“Yes, but let’s have the story first!” cried the general."
"“Prince,” said Nastasia Philipovna, unexpectedly turning to Muishkin,
“here are my old friends, Totski and General Epanchin, who wish to marry
me off."
Tell me what you think.
Shall I marry or not?
"As you decide, so
shall it be.”

Totski grew white as a sheet."
The general was struck dumb.
"All present
started and listened intently."
Gania sat rooted to his chair.
"“Marry whom?” asked the prince, faintly."
"“Gavrila Ardalionovitch Ivolgin,” said Nastasia, firmly and evenly."
There were a few seconds of dead silence.
"The prince tried to speak, but could not form his words; a great weight
seemed to lie upon his breast and suffocate him."
“N-no!
"don’t marry him!” he whispered at last, drawing his breath with
an effort."
"“So be it, then."
"Gavrila Ardalionovitch,” she spoke solemnly and
forcibly, “you hear the prince’s decision?"
"Take it as my decision; and
let that be the end of the matter for good and all.”

“Nastasia Philipovna!” cried Totski, in a quaking voice."
"“Nastasia Philipovna!” said the general, in persuasive but agitated
tones."
"Everyone in the room fidgeted in their places, and waited to see what
was coming next."
"“Well, gentlemen!” she continued, gazing around in apparent
astonishment; “what do you all look so alarmed about?"
"Why are you so
upset?”

“But--recollect, Nastasia Philipovna,” stammered Totski, “you gave a
promise, quite a free one, and--and you might have spared us this."
"I am
confused and bewildered, I know; but, in a word, at such a moment, and
before company, and all so-so-irregular, finishing off a game with a
serious matter like this, a matter of honour, and of heart, and--”

“I don’t follow you, Afanasy Ivanovitch; you are losing your head."
"In
the first place, what do you mean by ‘before company’?"
"Isn’t the company
good enough for you?"
And what’s all that about ‘a game’?
"I wished to
tell my little story, and I told it!"
Don’t you like it?
"You heard what
I said to the prince?"
"‘As you decide, so it shall be!’ If he had said
‘yes,’ I should have given my consent!"
"But he said ‘no,’ so I refused."
Here was my whole life hanging on his one word!
"Surely I was serious
enough?”

“The prince!"
What on earth has the prince got to do with it?
"Who the
deuce is the prince?” cried the general, who could conceal his wrath no
longer."
"“The prince has this to do with it--that I see in him for the first
time in all my life, a man endowed with real truthfulness of spirit, and
I trust him."
"He trusted me at first sight, and I trust him!”

“It only remains for me, then, to thank Nastasia Philipovna for the
great delicacy with which she has treated me,” said Gania, as pale as
death, and with quivering lips."
"“That is my plain duty, of course; but
the prince--what has he to do in the matter?”

“I see what you are driving at,” said Nastasia Philipovna."
"“You imply
that the prince is after the seventy-five thousand roubles--I quite
understand you."
"Mr. Totski, I forgot to say, ‘Take your seventy-five
thousand roubles’--I don’t want them."
"I let you go free for nothing--take
your freedom!"
You must need it.
"Nine years and three months’ captivity
is enough for anybody."
"Tomorrow I shall start afresh--today I am a free
agent for the first time in my life."
"“General, you must take your pearls back, too--give them to your
wife--here they are!"
"Tomorrow I shall leave this flat altogether, and
then there’ll be no more of these pleasant little social gatherings,
ladies and gentlemen.”

So saying, she scornfully rose from her seat as though to depart."
“Nastasia Philipovna!
"Nastasia Philipovna!”

The words burst involuntarily from every mouth."
"All present started up
in bewildered excitement; all surrounded her; all had listened uneasily
to her wild, disconnected sentences."
"All felt that something had
happened, something had gone very far wrong indeed, but no one could
make head or tail of the matter."
"At this moment there was a furious ring at the bell, and a great knock
at the door--exactly similar to the one which had startled the company
at Gania’s house in the afternoon."
"“Ah, ah!"
"here’s the climax at last, at half-past twelve!” cried Nastasia
Philipovna."
"“Sit down, gentlemen, I beg you."
"Something is about to
happen.”

So saying, she reseated herself; a strange smile played on her lips."
"She
sat quite still, but watched the door in a fever of impatience."
"“Rogojin and his hundred thousand roubles, no doubt of it,” muttered
Ptitsin to himself."
XV.
"Katia, the maid-servant, made her appearance, terribly frightened."
"“Goodness knows what it means, ma’am,” she said."
"“There is a whole
collection of men come--all tipsy--and want to see you."
"They say that
‘it’s Rogojin, and she knows all about it.’”

“It’s all right, Katia, let them all in at once.”

“Surely not _all_, ma’am?"
"They seem so disorderly--it’s dreadful to see
them.”

“Yes _all_, Katia, all--every one of them."
"Let them in, or they’ll come
in whether you like or no."
Listen!
what a noise they are making!
"Perhaps
you are offended, gentlemen, that I should receive such guests in your
presence?"
"I am very sorry, and ask your forgiveness, but it cannot be
helped--and I should be very grateful if you could all stay and witness
this climax."
"However, just as you please, of course.”

The guests exchanged glances; they were annoyed and bewildered by the
episode; but it was clear enough that all this had been pre-arranged and
expected by Nastasia Philipovna, and that there was no use in trying to
stop her now--for she was little short of insane."
"Besides, they were naturally inquisitive to see what was to happen."
There was nobody who would be likely to feel much alarm.
"There were
but two ladies present; one of whom was the lively actress, who was not
easily frightened, and the other the silent German beauty who, it turned
out, did not understand a word of Russian, and seemed to be as stupid as
she was lovely."
"Her acquaintances invited her to their “At Homes” because she was so
decorative."
"She was exhibited to their guests like a valuable picture,
or vase, or statue, or firescreen."
"As for the men, Ptitsin was one of
Rogojin’s friends; Ferdishenko was as much at home as a fish in the sea,
Gania, not yet recovered from his amazement, appeared to be chained to
a pillory."
"The old professor did not in the least understand what was
happening; but when he noticed how extremely agitated the mistress of
the house, and her friends, seemed, he nearly wept, and trembled with
fright: but he would rather have died than leave Nastasia Philipovna at
such a crisis, for he loved her as if she were his own granddaughter."
"Afanasy Ivanovitch greatly disliked having anything to do with the
affair, but he was too much interested to leave, in spite of the mad
turn things had taken; and a few words that had dropped from the lips
of Nastasia puzzled him so much, that he felt he could not go without
an explanation."
"He resolved therefore, to see it out, and to adopt the
attitude of silent spectator, as most suited to his dignity."
"General
Epanchin alone determined to depart."
"He was annoyed at the manner in
which his gift had been returned, as though he had condescended, under
the influence of passion, to place himself on a level with Ptitsin and
Ferdishenko, his self-respect and sense of duty now returned together
with a consciousness of what was due to his social rank and official
importance."
"In short, he plainly showed his conviction that a man in his
position could have nothing to do with Rogojin and his companions."
"But
Nastasia interrupted him at his first words."
"“Ah, general!” she cried, “I was forgetting!"
"If I had only foreseen
this unpleasantness!"
"I won’t insist on keeping you against your will,
although I should have liked you to be beside me now."
"In any case, I am
most grateful to you for your visit, and flattering attention... but if
you are afraid...”

“Excuse me, Nastasia Philipovna,” interrupted the general, with
chivalric generosity."
“To whom are you speaking?
"I have remained until
now simply because of my devotion to you, and as for danger, I am only
afraid that the carpets may be ruined, and the furniture smashed!..."
"You
should shut the door on the lot, in my opinion."
"But I confess that I am
extremely curious to see how it ends.”

“Rogojin!” announced Ferdishenko."
“What do you think about it?” said the general in a low voice to Totski.
“Is she mad?
"I mean mad in the medical sense of the word .... eh?”

“I’ve always said she was predisposed to it,” whispered Afanasy
Ivanovitch slyly."
"“Perhaps it is a fever!”

Since their visit to Gania’s home, Rogojin’s followers had been
increased by two new recruits--a dissolute old man, the hero of some
ancient scandal, and a retired sub-lieutenant."
"A laughable story was
told of the former."
"He possessed, it was said, a set of false teeth, and
one day when he wanted money for a drinking orgy, he pawned them, and
was never able to reclaim them!"
"The officer appeared to be a rival of
the gentleman who was so proud of his fists."
"He was known to none of
Rogojin’s followers, but as they passed by the Nevsky, where he stood
begging, he had joined their ranks."
"His claim for the charity he desired
seemed based on the fact that in the days of his prosperity he had given
away as much as fifteen roubles at a time."
"The rivals seemed more than
a little jealous of one another."
"The athlete appeared injured at the
admission of the “beggar” into the company."
"By nature taciturn, he now
merely growled occasionally like a bear, and glared contemptuously
upon the “beggar,” who, being somewhat of a man of the world, and a
diplomatist, tried to insinuate himself into the bear’s good graces."
"He was a much smaller man than the athlete, and doubtless was conscious
that he must tread warily."
"Gently and without argument he alluded to
the advantages of the English style in boxing, and showed himself a
firm believer in Western institutions."
"The athlete’s lips curled
disdainfully, and without honouring his adversary with a formal denial,
he exhibited, as if by accident, that peculiarly Russian object--an
enormous fist, clenched, muscular, and covered with red hairs!"
"The sight
of this pre-eminently national attribute was enough to convince anybody,
without words, that it was a serious matter for those who should happen
to come into contact with it."
"None of the band were very drunk, for the leader had kept his intended
visit to Nastasia in view all day, and had done his best to prevent
his followers from drinking too much."
"He was sober himself, but the
excitement of this chaotic day--the strangest day of his life--had
affected him so that he was in a dazed, wild condition, which almost
resembled drunkenness."
"He had kept but one idea before him all day, and for that he had worked
in an agony of anxiety and a fever of suspense."
"His lieutenants had
worked so hard from five o’clock until eleven, that they actually had
collected a hundred thousand roubles for him, but at such terrific
expense, that the rate of interest was only mentioned among them in
whispers and with bated breath."
"As before, Rogojin walked in advance of his troop, who followed him with
mingled self-assertion and timidity."
"They were specially frightened of
Nastasia Philipovna herself, for some reason."
"Many of them expected to be thrown downstairs at once, without further
ceremony, the elegant and irresistible Zaleshoff among them."
"But
the party led by the athlete, without openly showing their hostile
intentions, silently nursed contempt and even hatred for Nastasia
Philipovna, and marched into her house as they would have marched into
an enemy’s fortress."
"Arrived there, the luxury of the rooms seemed to
inspire them with a kind of respect, not unmixed with alarm."
"So many
things were entirely new to their experience--the choice furniture, the
pictures, the great statue of Venus."
"They followed their chief into the
salon, however, with a kind of impudent curiosity."
"There, the sight of
General Epanchin among the guests, caused many of them to beat a hasty
retreat into the adjoining room, the “boxer” and “beggar” being among
the first to go."
"A few only, of whom Lebedeff made one, stood their
ground; he had contrived to walk side by side with Rogojin, for he quite
understood the importance of a man who had a fortune of a million odd
roubles, and who at this moment carried a hundred thousand in his hand."
"It may be added that the whole company, not excepting Lebedeff, had the
vaguest idea of the extent of their powers, and of how far they could
safely go."
"At some moments Lebedeff was sure that right was on their
side; at others he tried uneasily to remember various cheering and
reassuring articles of the Civil Code."
"Rogojin, when he stepped into the room, and his eyes fell upon Nastasia,
stopped short, grew white as a sheet, and stood staring; it was clear
that his heart was beating painfully."
"So he stood, gazing intently, but
timidly, for a few seconds."
"Suddenly, as though bereft of his senses, he
moved forward, staggering helplessly, towards the table."
"On his way he
collided against Ptitsin’s chair, and put his dirty foot on the lace
skirt of the silent lady’s dress; but he neither apologized for this,
nor even noticed it."
"On reaching the table, he placed upon it a strange-looking object, which
he had carried with him into the drawing-room."
"This was a paper packet,
some six or seven inches thick, and eight or nine in length, wrapped in
an old newspaper, and tied round three or four times with string."
"Having placed this before her, he stood with drooped arms and head, as
though awaiting his sentence."
"His costume was the same as it had been in the morning, except for a new
silk handkerchief round his neck, bright green and red, fastened with a
huge diamond pin, and an enormous diamond ring on his dirty forefinger."
"Lebedeff stood two or three paces behind his chief; and the rest of the
band waited about near the door."
"The two maid-servants were both peeping in, frightened and amazed at
this unusual and disorderly scene."
"“What is that?” asked Nastasia Philipovna, gazing intently at Rogojin,
and indicating the paper packet."
"“A hundred thousand,” replied the latter, almost in a whisper."
“Oh!
so he kept his word--there’s a man for you!
"Well, sit down,
please--take that chair."
I shall have something to say to you presently.
Who are all these with you?
The same party?
"Let them come in and sit
down."
"There’s room on that sofa, there are some chairs and there’s
another sofa!"
"Well, why don’t they sit down?”

Sure enough, some of the brave fellows entirely lost their heads at this
point, and retreated into the next room."
"Others, however, took the hint
and sat down, as far as they could from the table, however; feeling
braver in proportion to their distance from Nastasia."
"Rogojin took the chair offered him, but he did not sit long; he soon
stood up again, and did not reseat himself."
"Little by little he began
to look around him and discern the other guests."
"Seeing Gania, he smiled
venomously and muttered to himself, “Look at that!”

He gazed at Totski and the general with no apparent confusion, and with
very little curiosity."
"But when he observed that the prince was seated
beside Nastasia Philipovna, he could not take his eyes off him for
a long while, and was clearly amazed."
"He could not account for the
prince’s presence there."
"It was not in the least surprising that Rogojin
should be, at this time, in a more or less delirious condition; for not
to speak of the excitements of the day, he had spent the night before in
the train, and had not slept more than a wink for forty-eight hours."
"“This, gentlemen, is a hundred thousand roubles,” said Nastasia
Philipovna, addressing the company in general, “here, in this dirty
parcel."
"This afternoon Rogojin yelled, like a madman, that he would
bring me a hundred thousand in the evening, and I have been waiting for
him all the while."
"He was bargaining for me, you know; first he offered
me eighteen thousand; then he rose to forty, and then to a hundred
thousand."
"And he has kept his word, see!"
"My goodness, how white he is!"
"All this happened this afternoon, at Gania’s."
"I had gone to pay his
mother a visit--my future family, you know!"
"And his sister said to my
very face, surely somebody will turn this shameless creature out."
"After
which she spat in her brother Gania’s face--a girl of character, that!”

“Nastasia Philipovna!” began the general, reproachfully."
"He was
beginning to put his own interpretation on the affair."
"“Well, what, general?"
"Not quite good form, eh?"
"Oh, nonsense!"
"Here have
I been sitting in my box at the French theatre for the last five years
like a statue of inaccessible virtue, and kept out of the way of all
admirers, like a silly little idiot!"
"Now, there’s this man, who comes
and pays down his hundred thousand on the table, before you all, in
spite of my five years of innocence and proud virtue, and I dare be
sworn he has his sledge outside waiting to carry me off."
"He values me
at a hundred thousand!"
"I see you are still angry with me, Gania!"
"Why, surely you never really wished to take _me_ into your family?"
"_me_,
Rogojin’s mistress!"
"What did the prince say just now?”

“I never said you were Rogojin’s mistress--you are _not!_” said the
prince, in trembling accents."
"“Nastasia Philipovna, dear soul!” cried the actress, impatiently, “do
be calm, dear!"
If it annoys you so--all this--do go away and rest!
"Of
course you would never go with this wretched fellow, in spite of his
hundred thousand roubles!"
"Take his money and kick him out of the house;
that’s the way to treat him and the likes of him!"
"Upon my word, if it
were my business, I’d soon clear them all out!”

The actress was a kind-hearted woman, and highly impressionable."
"She was
very angry now."
"“Don’t be cross, Daria Alexeyevna!” laughed Nastasia."
"“I was not angry
when I spoke; I wasn’t reproaching Gania."
"I don’t know how it was that I
ever could have indulged the whim of entering an honest family like his."
"I saw his mother--and kissed her hand, too."
"I came and stirred up all
that fuss, Gania, this afternoon, on purpose to see how much you could
swallow--you surprised me, my friend--you did, indeed."
"Surely you could
not marry a woman who accepts pearls like those you knew the general was
going to give me, on the very eve of her marriage?"
And Rogojin!
"Why, in
your own house and before your own brother and sister, he bargained with
me!"
"Yet you could come here and expect to be betrothed to me before you
left the house!"
"You almost brought your sister, too."
"Surely what Rogojin
said about you is not really true: that you would crawl all the way to
the other end of the town, on hands and knees, for three roubles?”

“Yes, he would!” said Rogojin, quietly, but with an air of absolute
conviction."
“H’m!
"and he receives a good salary, I’m told."
"Well, what should you get
but disgrace and misery if you took a wife you hated into your family
(for I know very well that you do hate me)?"
"No, no!"
"I believe now that a
man like you would murder anyone for money--sharpen a razor and come
up behind his best friend and cut his throat like a sheep--I’ve read
of such people."
Everyone seems money-mad nowadays.
"No, no!"
"I may be
shameless, but you are far worse."
"I don’t say a word about that other--”

“Nastasia Philipovna, is this really you?"
"You, once so refined and
delicate of speech."
"Oh, what a tongue!"
"What dreadful things you are
saying,” cried the general, wringing his hands in real grief."
"“I am intoxicated, general."
"I am having a day out, you know--it’s my
birthday!"
I have long looked forward to this happy occasion.
"Daria
Alexeyevna, you see that nosegay-man, that Monsieur aux Camelias,
sitting there laughing at us?”

“I am not laughing, Nastasia Philipovna; I am only listening with all my
attention,” said Totski, with dignity."
"“Well, why have I worried him, for five years, and never let him go
free?"
Is he worth it?
"He is only just what he ought to be--nothing
particular."
"He thinks I am to blame, too."
"He gave me my education, kept
me like a countess."
Money--my word!
"What a lot of money he spent over
me!"
"And he tried to find me an honest husband first, and then this
Gania, here."
And what do you think?
"All these five years I did not
live with him, and yet I took his money, and considered I was quite
justified."
"“You say, take the hundred thousand and kick that man out."
"It is true,
it is an abominable business, as you say."
"I might have married long ago,
not Gania--Oh, no!--but that would have been abominable too."
"“Would you believe it, I had some thoughts of marrying Totski, four
years ago!"
"I meant mischief, I confess--but I could have had him, I give
you my word; he asked me himself."
"But I thought, no!"
"it’s not worthwhile
to take such advantage of him."
No!
"I had better go on to the streets, or
accept Rogojin, or become a washerwoman or something--for I have nothing
of my own, you know."
"I shall go away and leave everything behind, to
the last rag--he shall have it all back."
"And who would take me without
anything?"
"Ask Gania, there, whether he would."
"Why, even Ferdishenko
wouldn’t have me!”

“No, Ferdishenko would not; he is a candid fellow, Nastasia Philipovna,”
 said that worthy."
“But the prince would.
"You sit here making complaints,
but just look at the prince."
"I’ve been observing him for a long while.”

Nastasia Philipovna looked keenly round at the prince."
“Is that true?” she asked.
"“Quite true,” whispered the prince."
"“You’ll take me as I am, with nothing?”

“I will, Nastasia Philipovna.”

“Here’s a pretty business!” cried the general."
"“However, it might have
been expected of him.”

The prince continued to regard Nastasia with a sorrowful, but intent and
piercing, gaze."
"“Here’s another alternative for me,” said Nastasia, turning once more to
the actress; “and he does it out of pure kindness of heart."
I know him.
I’ve found a benefactor.
"Perhaps, though, what they say about him may be
true--that he’s an--we know what."
"And what shall you live on, if you are
really so madly in love with Rogojin’s mistress, that you are ready to
marry her--eh?”

“I take you as a good, honest woman, Nastasia Philipovna--not as
Rogojin’s mistress.”

“Who?"
"I?--good and honest?”

“Yes, you.”

“Oh, you get those ideas out of novels, you know."
"Times are changed
now, dear prince; the world sees things as they really are."
"That’s all
nonsense."
"Besides, how can you marry?"
"You need a nurse, not a wife.”

The prince rose and began to speak in a trembling, timid tone, but with
the air of a man absolutely sure of the truth of his words."
"“I know nothing, Nastasia Philipovna."
I have seen nothing.
"You are right
so far; but I consider that you would be honouring me, and not I you."
"I
am a nobody."
"You have suffered, you have passed through hell and emerged
pure, and that is very much."
"Why do you shame yourself by desiring to
go with Rogojin?"
You are delirious.
"You have returned to Mr. Totski his
seventy-five thousand roubles, and declared that you will leave this
house and all that is in it, which is a line of conduct that not one
person here would imitate."
"Nastasia Philipovna, I love you!"
"I would die
for you."
"I shall never let any man say one word against you, Nastasia
Philipovna!"
"and if we are poor, I can work for both.”

As the prince spoke these last words a titter was heard from
Ferdishenko; Lebedeff laughed too."
"The general grunted with irritation;
Ptitsin and Totski barely restrained their smiles."
"The rest all sat
listening, open-mouthed with wonder."
"“But perhaps we shall not be poor; we may be very rich, Nastasia
Philipovna,” continued the prince, in the same timid, quivering tones."
"“I don’t know for certain, and I’m sorry to say I haven’t had an
opportunity of finding out all day; but I received a letter from Moscow,
while I was in Switzerland, from a Mr. Salaskin, and he acquaints me
with the fact that I am entitled to a very large inheritance."
"This
letter--”

The prince pulled a letter out of his pocket."
“Is he raving?” said the general.
"“Are we really in a mad-house?”

There was silence for a moment."
Then Ptitsin spoke.
"“I think you said, prince, that your letter was from Salaskin?"
"Salaskin
is a very eminent man, indeed, in his own world; he is a wonderfully
clever solicitor, and if he really tells you this, I think you may be
pretty sure that he is right."
"It so happens, luckily, that I know his
handwriting, for I have lately had business with him."
"If you would allow
me to see it, I should perhaps be able to tell you.”

The prince held out the letter silently, but with a shaking hand."
"“What, what?” said the general, much agitated."
“What’s all this?
"Is he really heir to anything?”

All present concentrated their attention upon Ptitsin, reading the
prince’s letter."
The general curiosity had received a new fillip.
Ferdishenko could not sit still.
"Rogojin fixed his eyes first on the
prince, and then on Ptitsin, and then back again; he was extremely
agitated."
Lebedeff could not stand it.
"He crept up and read over
Ptitsin’s shoulder, with the air of a naughty boy who expects a box on
the ear every moment for his indiscretion."
XVI.
"“It’s good business,” said Ptitsin, at last, folding the letter and
handing it back to the prince."
"“You will receive, without the slightest
trouble, by the last will and testament of your aunt, a very large sum
of money indeed.”

“Impossible!” cried the general, starting up as if he had been shot."
"Ptitsin explained, for the benefit of the company, that the prince’s
aunt had died five months since."
"He had never known her, but she was his
mother’s own sister, the daughter of a Moscow merchant, one Paparchin,
who had died a bankrupt."
"But the elder brother of this same Paparchin,
had been an eminent and very rich merchant."
"A year since it had so
happened that his only two sons had both died within the same month."
"This sad event had so affected the old man that he, too, had died very
shortly after."
"He was a widower, and had no relations left, excepting
the prince’s aunt, a poor woman living on charity, who was herself at
the point of death from dropsy; but who had time, before she died,
to set Salaskin to work to find her nephew, and to make her will
bequeathing her newly-acquired fortune to him."
"It appeared that neither the prince, nor the doctor with whom he lived
in Switzerland, had thought of waiting for further communications;
but the prince had started straight away with Salaskin’s letter in his
pocket."
"“One thing I may tell you, for certain,” concluded Ptitsin, addressing
the prince, “that there is no question about the authenticity of this
matter."
"Anything that Salaskin writes you as regards your unquestionable
right to this inheritance, you may look upon as so much money in your
pocket."
"I congratulate you, prince; you may receive a million and a half
of roubles, perhaps more; I don’t know."
"All I _do_ know is that Paparchin
was a very rich merchant indeed.”

“Hurrah!” cried Lebedeff, in a drunken voice."
"“Hurrah for the last of
the Muishkins!”

“My goodness me!"
"and I gave him twenty-five roubles this morning as
though he were a beggar,” blurted out the general, half senseless with
amazement."
"“Well, I congratulate you, I congratulate you!” And the
general rose from his seat and solemnly embraced the prince."
"All came
forward with congratulations; even those of Rogojin’s party who had
retreated into the next room, now crept softly back to look on."
"For the
moment even Nastasia Philipovna was forgotten."
"But gradually the consciousness crept back into the minds of each one
present that the prince had just made her an offer of marriage."
"The
situation had, therefore, become three times as fantastic as before."
"Totski sat and shrugged his shoulders, bewildered."
"He was the only guest
left sitting at this time; the others had thronged round the table in
disorder, and were all talking at once."
"It was generally agreed, afterwards, in recalling that evening, that
from this moment Nastasia Philipovna seemed entirely to lose her senses."
"She continued to sit still in her place, looking around at her guests
with a strange, bewildered expression, as though she were trying to
collect her thoughts, and could not."
"Then she suddenly turned to the
prince, and glared at him with frowning brows; but this only lasted one
moment."
"Perhaps it suddenly struck her that all this was a jest, but his
face seemed to reassure her."
"She reflected, and smiled again, vaguely."
"“So I am really a princess,” she whispered to herself, ironically,
and glancing accidentally at Daria Alexeyevna’s face, she burst out
laughing."
"“Ha, ha, ha!” she cried, “this is an unexpected climax, after all."
"I
didn’t expect this."
"What are you all standing up for, gentlemen?"
"Sit
down; congratulate me and the prince!"
"Ferdishenko, just step out and
order some more champagne, will you?"
"Katia, Pasha,” she added suddenly,
seeing the servants at the door, “come here!"
"I’m going to be married,
did you hear?"
To the prince.
"He has a million and a half of roubles; he
is Prince Muishkin, and has asked me to marry him."
"Here, prince, come
and sit by me; and here comes the wine."
"Now then, ladies and gentlemen,
where are your congratulations?”

“Hurrah!” cried a number of voices."
"A rush was made for the wine by
Rogojin’s followers, though, even among them, there seemed some sort of
realization that the situation had changed."
"Rogojin stood and looked on,
with an incredulous smile, screwing up one side of his mouth."
"“Prince, my dear fellow, do remember what you are about,” said the
general, approaching Muishkin, and pulling him by the coat sleeve."
"Nastasia Philipovna overheard the remark, and burst out laughing."
"“No, no, general!” she cried."
“You had better look out!
"I am the
princess now, you know."
The prince won’t let you insult me.
"Afanasy
Ivanovitch, why don’t you congratulate me?"
"I shall be able to sit at
table with your new wife, now."
Aha!
"you see what I gain by marrying
a prince!"
"A million and a half, and a prince, and an idiot into the
bargain, they say."
What better could I wish for?
"Life is only just about
to commence for me in earnest."
"Rogojin, you are a little too late."
"Away
with your paper parcel!"
"I’m going to marry the prince; I’m richer than
you are now.”

But Rogojin understood how things were tending, at last."
"An
inexpressibly painful expression came over his face."
"He wrung his hands;
a groan made its way up from the depths of his soul."
"“Surrender her, for God’s sake!” he said to the prince."
All around burst out laughing.
“What?
Surrender her to _you?_” cried Daria Alexeyevna.
"“To a fellow who
comes and bargains for a wife like a moujik!"
"The prince wishes to marry
her, and you--”

“So do I, so do I!"
"This moment, if I could!"
"I’d give every farthing I
have to do it.”

“You drunken moujik,” said Daria Alexeyevna, once more."
"“You ought to be
kicked out of the place.”

The laughter became louder than ever."
"“Do you hear, prince?” said Nastasia Philipovna."
"“Do you hear how this
moujik of a fellow goes on bargaining for your bride?”

“He is drunk,” said the prince, quietly, “and he loves you very much.”

“Won’t you be ashamed, afterwards, to reflect that your wife very nearly
ran away with Rogojin?”

“Oh, you were raving, you were in a fever; you are still half
delirious.”

“And won’t you be ashamed when they tell you, afterwards, that your wife
lived at Totski’s expense so many years?”

“No; I shall not be ashamed of that."
"You did not so live by your own
will.”

“And you’ll never reproach me with it?”

“Never.”

“Take care, don’t commit yourself for a whole lifetime.”

“Nastasia Philipovna.” said the prince, quietly, and with deep emotion,
“I said before that I shall esteem your consent to be my wife as a great
honour to myself, and shall consider that it is you who will honour
me, not I you, by our marriage."
"You laughed at these words, and others
around us laughed as well; I heard them."
"Very likely I expressed myself
funnily, and I may have looked funny, but, for all that, I believe I
understand where honour lies, and what I said was but the literal truth."
"You were about to ruin yourself just now, irrevocably; you would
never have forgiven yourself for so doing afterwards; and yet, you
are absolutely blameless."
"It is impossible that your life should be
altogether ruined at your age."
"What matter that Rogojin came bargaining
here, and that Gavrila Ardalionovitch would have deceived you if he
could?"
Why do you continually remind us of these facts?
"I assure you
once more that very few could find it in them to act as you have acted
this day."
"As for your wish to go with Rogojin, that was simply the idea
of a delirious and suffering brain."
"You are still quite feverish; you
ought to be in bed, not here."
"You know quite well that if you had gone
with Rogojin, you would have become a washer-woman next day, rather than
stay with him."
"You are proud, Nastasia Philipovna, and perhaps you have
really suffered so much that you imagine yourself to be a desperately
guilty woman."
"You require a great deal of petting and looking after,
Nastasia Philipovna, and I will do this."
"I saw your portrait this
morning, and it seemed quite a familiar face to me; it seemed to me that
the portrait-face was calling to me for help."
"I--I shall respect you all
my life, Nastasia Philipovna,” concluded the prince, as though suddenly
recollecting himself, and blushing to think of the sort of company
before whom he had said all this."
"Ptitsin bowed his head and looked at the ground, overcome by a mixture
of feelings."
"Totski muttered to himself: “He may be an idiot, but he
knows that flattery is the best road to success here.”

The prince observed Gania’s eyes flashing at him, as though they would
gladly annihilate him then and there."
"“That’s a kind-hearted man, if you like,” said Daria Alexeyevna, whose
wrath was quickly evaporating."
"“A refined man, but--lost,” murmured the general."
Totski took his hat and rose to go.
"He and the general exchanged
glances, making a private arrangement, thereby, to leave the house
together."
"“Thank you, prince; no one has ever spoken to me like that before,”
 began Nastasia Philipovna."
"“Men have always bargained for me, before
this; and not a single respectable man has ever proposed to marry me."
"Do
you hear, Afanasy Ivanovitch?"
"What do _you_ think of what the prince has
just been saying?"
"It was almost immodest, wasn’t it?"
"You, Rogojin, wait
a moment, don’t go yet!"
I see you don’t intend to move however.
"Perhaps
I may go with you yet."
"Where did you mean to take me to?”

“To Ekaterinhof,” replied Lebedeff."
"Rogojin simply stood staring, with
trembling lips, not daring to believe his ears."
"He was stunned, as
though from a blow on the head."
"“What are you thinking of, my dear Nastasia?” said Daria Alexeyevna in
alarm."
"“What are you saying?” “You are not going mad, are you?”

Nastasia Philipovna burst out laughing and jumped up from the sofa."
"“You thought I should accept this good child’s invitation to ruin
him, did you?” she cried."
"“That’s Totski’s way, not mine."
"He’s fond of
children."
"Come along, Rogojin, get your money ready!"
"We won’t talk about
marrying just at this moment, but let’s see the money at all events."
Come!
"I may not marry you, either."
I don’t know.
"I suppose you thought
you’d keep the money, if I did!"
"Ha, ha, ha!"
nonsense!
"I have no sense of
shame left."
I tell you I have been Totski’s concubine.
"Prince, you
must marry Aglaya Ivanovna, not Nastasia Philipovna, or this fellow
Ferdishenko will always be pointing the finger of scorn at you."
"You
aren’t afraid, I know; but I should always be afraid that I had ruined
you, and that you would reproach me for it."
"As for what you say about
my doing you honour by marrying you--well, Totski can tell you all about
that."
"You had your eye on Aglaya, Gania, you know you had; and you might
have married her if you had not come bargaining."
"You are all like
this."
"You should choose, once for all, between disreputable women, and
respectable ones, or you are sure to get mixed."
"Look at the general, how
he’s staring at me!”

“This is too horrible,” said the general, starting to his feet."
"All were
standing up now."
Nastasia was absolutely beside herself.
"“I am very proud, in spite of what I am,” she continued."
"“You called me
‘perfection’ just now, prince."
"A nice sort of perfection to throw up a
prince and a million and a half of roubles in order to be able to boast
of the fact afterwards!"
"What sort of a wife should I make for you, after
all I have said?"
"Afanasy Ivanovitch, do you observe I have really and
truly thrown away a million of roubles?"
"And you thought that I should
consider your wretched seventy-five thousand, with Gania thrown in for a
husband, a paradise of bliss!"
"Take your seventy-five thousand back, sir;
you did not reach the hundred thousand."
"Rogojin cut a better dash than
you did."
I’ll console Gania myself; I have an idea about that.
"But now I
must be off!"
I’ve been in prison for ten years.
I’m free at last!
"Well,
Rogojin, what are you waiting for?"
"Let’s get ready and go.”

“Come along!” shouted Rogojin, beside himself with joy."
“Hey!
"all of you
fellows!"
Wine!
Round with it!
"Fill the glasses!”

“Get away!” he shouted frantically, observing that Daria Alexeyevna
was approaching to protest against Nastasia’s conduct."
"“Get away, she’s
mine, everything’s mine!"
"She’s a queen, get away!”

He was panting with ecstasy."
"He walked round and round Nastasia
Philipovna and told everybody to “keep their distance.”

All the Rogojin company were now collected in the drawing-room; some
were drinking, some laughed and talked: all were in the highest and
wildest spirits."
"Ferdishenko was doing his best to unite himself to
them; the general and Totski again made an attempt to go."
"Gania, too
stood hat in hand ready to go; but seemed to be unable to tear his eyes
away from the scene before him."
"“Get out, keep your distance!” shouted Rogojin."
“What are you shouting about there!” cried Nastasia “I’m not yours yet.
"I may kick you out for all you know I haven’t taken your money yet;
there it all is on the table."
"Here, give me over that packet!"
"Is there a
hundred thousand roubles in that one packet?"
Pfu!
"what abominable stuff
it looks!"
Oh!
"nonsense, Daria Alexeyevna; you surely did not expect me
to ruin _him?_” (indicating the prince)."
“Fancy him nursing me!
"Why, he
needs a nurse himself!"
"The general, there, will be his nurse now, you’ll
see."
"Here, prince, look here!"
Your bride is accepting money.
"What a
disreputable woman she must be!"
And you wished to marry her!
"What are
you crying about?"
Is it a bitter dose?
"Never mind, you shall laugh yet."
"Trust to time.” (In spite of these words there were two large tears
rolling down Nastasia’s own cheeks.)"
"“It’s far better to think twice
of it now than afterwards."
Oh!
you mustn’t cry like that!
"There’s Katia
crying, too."
"What is it, Katia, dear?"
"I shall leave you and Pasha a lot
of things, I’ve laid them out for you already; but good-bye, now."
"I made
an honest girl like you serve a low woman like myself."
"It’s better so,
prince, it is indeed."
"You’d begin to despise me afterwards--we should
never be happy."
Oh!
"you needn’t swear, prince, I shan’t believe you, you
know."
"How foolish it would be, too!"
"No, no; we’d better say good-bye and
part friends."
"I am a bit of a dreamer myself, and I used to dream of you
once."
"Very often during those five years down at his estate I used to
dream and think, and I always imagined just such a good, honest, foolish
fellow as you, one who should come and say to me: ‘You are an innocent
woman, Nastasia Philipovna, and I adore you.’ I dreamt of you often."
"I
used to think so much down there that I nearly went mad; and then this
fellow here would come down."
"He would stay a couple of months out of the
twelve, and disgrace and insult and deprave me, and then go; so that I
longed to drown myself in the pond a thousand times over; but I did not
dare do it."
"I hadn’t the heart, and now--well, are you ready, Rogojin?”

“Ready--keep your distance, all of you!”

“We’re all ready,” said several of his friends."
"“The troikas [Sledges
drawn by three horses abreast.]"
"are at the door, bells and all.”

Nastasia Philipovna seized the packet of bank-notes."
"“Gania, I have an idea."
"I wish to recompense you--why should you
lose all?"
"Rogojin, would he crawl for three roubles as far as the
Vassiliostrof?”

“Oh, wouldn’t he just!”

“Well, look here, Gania."
"I wish to look into your heart once more, for
the last time."
"You’ve worried me for the last three months--now it’s my
turn."
Do you see this packet?
It contains a hundred thousand roubles.
"Now, I’m going to throw it into the fire, here--before all these
witnesses."
"As soon as the fire catches hold of it, you put your hands
into the fire and pick it out--without gloves, you know."
"You must have
bare hands, and you must turn your sleeves up."
"Pull it out, I say, and
it’s all yours."
"You may burn your fingers a little, of course; but then
it’s a hundred thousand roubles, remember--it won’t take you long to lay
hold of it and snatch it out."
"I shall so much admire you if you put your
hands into the fire for my money."
"All here present may be witnesses that
the whole packet of money is yours if you get it out."
"If you don’t get
it out, it shall burn."
"I will let no one else come; away--get away, all
of you--it’s my money!"
Rogojin has bought me with it.
"Is it my money,
Rogojin?”

“Yes, my queen; it’s your own money, my joy.”

“Get away then, all of you."
"I shall do as I like with my own--don’t
meddle!"
"Ferdishenko, make up the fire, quick!”

“Nastasia Philipovna, I can’t; my hands won’t obey me,” said
Ferdishenko, astounded and helpless with bewilderment."
"“Nonsense,” cried Nastasia Philipovna, seizing the poker and raking a
couple of logs together."
"No sooner did a tongue of flame burst out than
she threw the packet of notes upon it."
Everyone gasped; some even crossed themselves.
“She’s mad--she’s mad!” was the cry.
"“Oughtn’t-oughtn’t we to secure her?” asked the general of Ptitsin, in
a whisper; “or shall we send for the authorities?"
"Why, she’s mad, isn’t
she--isn’t she, eh?”

“N-no, I hardly think she is actually mad,” whispered Ptitsin, who was
as white as his handkerchief, and trembling like a leaf."
"He could not
take his eyes off the smouldering packet."
"“She’s mad surely, isn’t she?” the general appealed to Totski."
"“I told you she wasn’t an ordinary woman,” replied the latter, who was
as pale as anyone."
"“Oh, but, positively, you know--a hundred thousand roubles!”

“Goodness gracious!"
good heavens!” came from all quarters of the room.
"All now crowded round the fire and thronged to see what was going on;
everyone lamented and gave vent to exclamations of horror and woe."
"Some
jumped up on chairs in order to get a better view."
"Daria Alexeyevna
ran into the next room and whispered excitedly to Katia and Pasha."
"The
beautiful German disappeared altogether."
“My lady!
"my sovereign!” lamented Lebedeff, falling on his knees before
Nastasia Philipovna, and stretching out his hands towards the fire;
“it’s a hundred thousand roubles, it is indeed, I packed it up myself,
I saw the money!"
"My queen, let me get into the fire after it--say the
word--I’ll put my whole grey head into the fire for it!"
"I have a poor
lame wife and thirteen children."
My father died of starvation last week.
"Nastasia Philipovna, Nastasia Philipovna!” The wretched little man wept,
and groaned, and crawled towards the fire."
"“Away, out of the way!” cried Nastasia."
"“Make room, all of you!"
"Gania,
what are you standing there for?"
Don’t stand on ceremony.
"Put in your
hand!"
"There’s your whole happiness smouldering away, look!"
"Quick!”

But Gania had borne too much that day, and especially this evening, and
he was not prepared for this last, quite unexpected trial."
"The crowd parted on each side of him and he was left face to face with
Nastasia Philipovna, three paces from her."
"She stood by the fire and
waited, with her intent gaze fixed upon him."
"Gania stood before her, in his evening clothes, holding his white gloves
and hat in his hand, speechless and motionless, with arms folded and
eyes fixed on the fire."
"A silly, meaningless smile played on his white, death-like lips."
"He
could not take his eyes off the smouldering packet; but it appeared that
something new had come to birth in his soul--as though he were vowing to
himself that he would bear this trial."
He did not move from his place.
"In a few seconds it became evident to all that he did not intend to
rescue the money."
“Hey!
"look at it, it’ll burn in another minute or two!” cried Nastasia
Philipovna."
"“You’ll hang yourself afterwards, you know, if it does!"
"I’m
not joking.”

The fire, choked between a couple of smouldering pieces of wood, had
died down for the first few moments after the packet was thrown upon it."
"But a little tongue of fire now began to lick the paper from below,
and soon, gathering courage, mounted the sides of the parcel, and crept
around it."
"In another moment, the whole of it burst into flames, and the
exclamations of woe and horror were redoubled."
"“Nastasia Philipovna!” lamented Lebedeff again, straining towards the
fireplace; but Rogojin dragged him away, and pushed him to the rear once
more."
"The whole of Rogojin’s being was concentrated in one rapturous gaze of
ecstasy."
He could not take his eyes off Nastasia.
"He stood drinking her
in, as it were."
He was in the seventh heaven of delight.
"“Oh, what a queen she is!” he ejaculated, every other minute, throwing
out the remark for anyone who liked to catch it."
"“That’s the sort of
woman for me!"
"Which of you would think of doing a thing like that, you
blackguards, eh?” he yelled."
"He was hopelessly and wildly beside himself
with ecstasy."
"The prince watched the whole scene, silent and dejected."
"“I’ll pull it out with my teeth for one thousand,” said Ferdishenko."
"“So would I,” said another, from behind, “with pleasure."
"Devil take the
thing!” he added, in a tempest of despair, “it will all be burnt up in a
minute--It’s burning, it’s burning!”

“It’s burning, it’s burning!” cried all, thronging nearer and nearer to
the fire in their excitement."
"“Gania, don’t be a fool!"
"I tell you for the last time.”

“Get on, quick!” shrieked Ferdishenko, rushing wildly up to Gania, and
trying to drag him to the fire by the sleeve of his coat."
"“Get it, you
dummy, it’s burning away fast!"
"Oh--_damn_ the thing!”

Gania hurled Ferdishenko from him; then he turned sharp round and made
for the door."
"But he had not gone a couple of steps when he tottered and
fell to the ground."
“He’s fainted!” the cry went round.
"“And the money’s burning still,” Lebedeff lamented."
"“Burning for nothing,” shouted others."
“Katia-Pasha!
Bring him some water!” cried Nastasia Philipovna.
"Then she
took the tongs and fished out the packet."
"Nearly the whole of the outer covering was burned away, but it was
soon evident that the contents were hardly touched."
"The packet had been
wrapped in a threefold covering of newspaper, and the notes were safe."
All breathed more freely.
"“Some dirty little thousand or so may be touched,” said Lebedeff,
immensely relieved, “but there’s very little harm done, after all.”

“It’s all his--the whole packet is for him, do you hear--all of you?”
 cried Nastasia Philipovna, placing the packet by the side of Gania."
"“He restrained himself, and didn’t go after it; so his self-respect is
greater than his thirst for money."
"All right--he’ll come to directly--he
must have the packet or he’ll cut his throat afterwards."
There!
"He’s
coming to himself."
"General, Totski, all of you, did you hear me?"
"The
money is all Gania’s."
"I give it to him, fully conscious of my action, as
recompense for--well, for anything he thinks best."
Tell him so.
"Let it
lie here beside him."
"Off we go, Rogojin!"
"Goodbye, prince."
"I have seen
a man for the first time in my life."
"Goodbye, Afanasy Ivanovitch--and
thanks!”

The Rogojin gang followed their leader and Nastasia Philipovna to the
entrance-hall, laughing and shouting and whistling."
"In the hall the servants were waiting, and handed her her fur cloak."
"Martha, the cook, ran in from the kitchen."
"Nastasia kissed them all
round."
"“Are you really throwing us all over, little mother?"
"Where, where are
you going to?"
"And on your birthday, too!” cried the four girls, crying
over her and kissing her hands."
"“I am going out into the world, Katia; perhaps I shall be a laundress."
"I
don’t know."
"No more of Afanasy Ivanovitch, anyhow."
Give him my respects.
"Don’t think badly of me, girls.”

The prince hurried down to the front gate where the party were settling
into the troikas, all the bells tinkling a merry accompaniment the
while."
"The general caught him up on the stairs:

“Prince, prince!” he cried, seizing hold of his arm, “recollect
yourself!"
"Drop her, prince!"
You see what sort of a woman she is.
"I am
speaking to you like a father.”

The prince glanced at him, but said nothing."
"He shook himself free, and
rushed on downstairs."
"The general was just in time to see the prince take the first sledge he
could get, and, giving the order to Ekaterinhof, start off in pursuit
of the troikas."
"Then the general’s fine grey horse dragged that worthy
home, with some new thoughts, and some new hopes and calculations
developing in his brain, and with the pearls in his pocket, for he had
not forgotten to bring them along with him, being a man of business."
"Amid his new thoughts and ideas there came, once or twice, the image of
Nastasia Philipovna."
The general sighed.
"“I’m sorry, really sorry,” he muttered."
“She’s a ruined woman.
Mad!
mad!
"However, the prince is not for Nastasia Philipovna now,--perhaps it’s as
well.”

Two more of Nastasia’s guests, who walked a short distance together,
indulged in high moral sentiments of a similar nature."
"“Do you know, Totski, this is all very like what they say goes on
among the Japanese?” said Ptitsin."
"“The offended party there, they say,
marches off to his insulter and says to him, ‘You insulted me, so I have
come to rip myself open before your eyes;’ and with these words he
does actually rip his stomach open before his enemy, and considers,
doubtless, that he is having all possible and necessary satisfaction and
revenge."
"There are strange characters in the world, sir!”

“H’m!"
"and you think there was something of this sort here, do you?"
"Dear
me--a very remarkable comparison, you know!"
"But you must have observed,
my dear Ptitsin, that I did all I possibly could."
"I could do no more
than I did."
"And you must admit that there are some rare qualities in
this woman."
"I felt I could not speak in that Bedlam, or I should have
been tempted to cry out, when she reproached me, that she herself was
my best justification."
"Such a woman could make anyone forget all
reason--everything!"
"Even that moujik, Rogojin, you saw, brought her
a hundred thousand roubles!"
"Of course, all that happened tonight
was ephemeral, fantastic, unseemly--yet it lacked neither colour nor
originality."
My God!
"What might not have been made of such a character
combined with such beauty!"
"Yet in spite of all efforts--in spite of all
education, even--all those gifts are wasted!"
She is an uncut diamond....
"I have often said so.”

And Afanasy Ivanovitch heaved a deep sigh."
"PART II

I."
"Two days after the strange conclusion to Nastasia Philipovna’s birthday
party, with the record of which we concluded the first part of this
story, Prince Muishkin hurriedly left St. Petersburg for Moscow, in
order to see after some business connected with the receipt of his
unexpected fortune."
"It was said that there were other reasons for his hurried departure; but
as to this, and as to his movements in Moscow, and as to his
prolonged absence from St. Petersburg, we are able to give very little
information."
"The prince was away for six months, and even those who were most
interested in his destiny were able to pick up very little news about
him all that while."
"True, certain rumours did reach his friends, but
these were both strange and rare, and each one contradicted the last."
"Of course the Epanchin family was much interested in his movements,
though he had not had time to bid them farewell before his departure."
"The general, however, had had an opportunity of seeing him once or twice
since the eventful evening, and had spoken very seriously with him;
but though he had seen the prince, as I say, he told his family nothing
about the circumstance."
"In fact, for a month or so after his departure
it was considered not the thing to mention the prince’s name in the
Epanchin household."
"Only Mrs. Epanchin, at the commencement of this
period, had announced that she had been “cruelly mistaken in the
prince!” and a day or two after, she had added, evidently alluding
to him, but not mentioning his name, that it was an unalterable
characteristic of hers to be mistaken in people."
"Then once more, ten
days later, after some passage of arms with one of her daughters, she
had remarked sententiously."
“We have had enough of mistakes.
"I shall be
more careful in future!” However, it was impossible to avoid remarking
that there was some sense of oppression in the household--something
unspoken, but felt; something strained."
"All the members of the family
wore frowning looks."
"The general was unusually busy; his family hardly
ever saw him."
"As to the girls, nothing was said openly, at all events; and probably
very little in private."
"They were proud damsels, and were not always
perfectly confidential even among themselves."
"But they understood each
other thoroughly at the first word on all occasions; very often at the
first glance, so that there was no need of much talking as a rule."
"One fact, at least, would have been perfectly plain to an outsider, had
any such person been on the spot; and that was, that the prince had made
a very considerable impression upon the family, in spite of the fact
that he had but once been inside the house, and then only for a short
time."
"Of course, if analyzed, this impression might have proved to be
nothing more than a feeling of curiosity; but be it what it might, there
it undoubtedly was."
"Little by little, the rumours spread about town became lost in a maze of
uncertainty."
"It was said that some foolish young prince, name unknown,
had suddenly come into possession of a gigantic fortune, and had married
a French ballet dancer."
"This was contradicted, and the rumour circulated
that it was a young merchant who had come into the enormous fortune and
married the great ballet dancer, and that at the wedding the drunken
young fool had burned seventy thousand roubles at a candle out of pure
bravado."
"However, all these rumours soon died down, to which circumstance certain
facts largely contributed."
"For instance, the whole of the Rogojin troop
had departed, with him at their head, for Moscow."
"This was exactly a
week after a dreadful orgy at the Ekaterinhof gardens, where Nastasia
Philipovna had been present."
"It became known that after this orgy
Nastasia Philipovna had entirely disappeared, and that she had since
been traced to Moscow; so that the exodus of the Rogojin band was found
consistent with this report."
"There were rumours current as to Gania, too; but circumstances soon
contradicted these."
"He had fallen seriously ill, and his illness
precluded his appearance in society, and even at business, for over a
month."
"As soon as he had recovered, however, he threw up his situation
in the public company under General Epanchin’s direction, for some
unknown reason, and the post was given to another."
"He never went
near the Epanchins’ house at all, and was exceedingly irritable and
depressed."
"Varvara Ardalionovna married Ptitsin this winter, and it was said that
the fact of Gania’s retirement from business was the ultimate cause of
the marriage, since Gania was now not only unable to support his family,
but even required help himself."
"We may mention that Gania was no longer mentioned in the Epanchin
household any more than the prince was; but that a certain circumstance
in connection with the fatal evening at Nastasia’s house became known
to the general, and, in fact, to all the family the very next day."
"This
fact was that Gania had come home that night, but had refused to go to
bed."
"He had awaited the prince’s return from Ekaterinhof with feverish
impatience."
"On the latter’s arrival, at six in the morning, Gania had gone to him
in his room, bringing with him the singed packet of money, which he had
insisted that the prince should return to Nastasia Philipovna without
delay."
"It was said that when Gania entered the prince’s room, he came
with anything but friendly feelings, and in a condition of despair and
misery; but that after a short conversation, he had stayed on for a
couple of hours with him, sobbing continuously and bitterly the whole
time."
They had parted upon terms of cordial friendship.
"The Epanchins heard about this, as well as about the episode at Nastasia
Philipovna’s."
"It was strange, perhaps, that the facts should become so
quickly, and fairly accurately, known."
"As far as Gania was concerned,
it might have been supposed that the news had come through Varvara
Ardalionovna, who had suddenly become a frequent visitor of the Epanchin
girls, greatly to their mother’s surprise."
"But though Varvara had seen
fit, for some reason, to make friends with them, it was not likely
that she would have talked to them about her brother."
"She had plenty of
pride, in spite of the fact that in thus acting she was seeking intimacy
with people who had practically shown her brother the door."
"She and the
Epanchin girls had been acquainted in childhood, although of late
they had met but rarely."
"Even now Varvara hardly ever appeared in the
drawing-room, but would slip in by a back way."
"Lizabetha Prokofievna,
who disliked Varvara, although she had a great respect for her mother,
was much annoyed by this sudden intimacy, and put it down to the general
“contrariness” of her daughters, who were “always on the lookout for
some new way of opposing her.” Nevertheless, Varvara continued her
visits."
"A month after Muishkin’s departure, Mrs. Epanchin received a letter from
her old friend Princess Bielokonski (who had lately left for Moscow),
which letter put her into the greatest good humour."
"She did not divulge
its contents either to her daughters or the general, but her conduct
towards the former became affectionate in the extreme."
"She even made
some sort of confession to them, but they were unable to understand what
it was about."
"She actually relaxed towards the general a little--he had
been long disgraced--and though she managed to quarrel with them all the
next day, yet she soon came round, and from her general behaviour it was
to be concluded that she had had good news of some sort, which she would
like, but could not make up her mind, to disclose."
"However, a week later she received another letter from the same source,
and at last resolved to speak."
"She solemnly announced that she had heard from old Princess Bielokonski,
who had given her most comforting news about “that queer young prince.”
 Her friend had hunted him up, and found that all was going well with
him."
"He had since called in person upon her, making an extremely
favourable impression, for the princess had received him each day since,
and had introduced him into several good houses."
"The girls could see that their mother concealed a great deal from them,
and left out large pieces of the letter in reading it to them."
"However, the ice was broken, and it suddenly became possible to mention
the prince’s name again."
"And again it became evident how very strong was
the impression the young man had made in the household by his one visit
there."
"Mrs. Epanchin was surprised at the effect which the news from
Moscow had upon the girls, and they were no less surprised that after
solemnly remarking that her most striking characteristic was “being
mistaken in people” she should have troubled to obtain for the prince
the favour and protection of so powerful an old lady as the Princess
Bielokonski."
"As soon as the ice was thus broken, the general lost no
time in showing that he, too, took the greatest interest in the subject."
"He admitted that he was interested, but said that it was merely in the
business side of the question."
"It appeared that, in the interests of
the prince, he had made arrangements in Moscow for a careful watch to be
kept upon the prince’s business affairs, and especially upon Salaskin."
"All that had been said as to the prince being an undoubted heir to a
fortune turned out to be perfectly true; but the fortune proved to be
much smaller than was at first reported."
"The estate was considerably
encumbered with debts; creditors turned up on all sides, and the prince,
in spite of all advice and entreaty, insisted upon managing all matters
of claim himself--which, of course, meant satisfying everybody all
round, although half the claims were absolutely fraudulent."
Mrs. Epanchin confirmed all this.
"She said the princess had written to
much the same effect, and added that there was no curing a fool."
"But
it was plain, from her expression of face, how strongly she approved of
this particular young fool’s doings."
"In conclusion, the general observed
that his wife took as great an interest in the prince as though he were
her own son; and that she had commenced to be especially affectionate
towards Aglaya was a self-evident fact."
All this caused the general to look grave and important.
"But, alas!"
"this
agreeable state of affairs very soon changed once more."
"A couple of weeks went by, and suddenly the general and his wife were
once more gloomy and silent, and the ice was as firm as ever."
"The fact
was, the general, who had heard first, how Nastasia Philipovna had fled
to Moscow and had been discovered there by Rogojin; that she had then
disappeared once more, and been found again by Rogojin, and how after
that she had almost promised to marry him, now received news that she
had once more disappeared, almost on the very day fixed for her wedding,
flying somewhere into the interior of Russia this time, and that
Prince Muishkin had left all his affairs in the hands of Salaskin and
disappeared also--but whether he was with Nastasia, or had only set off
in search of her, was unknown."
"Lizabetha Prokofievna received confirmatory news from the princess--and
alas, two months after the prince’s first departure from St. Petersburg,
darkness and mystery once more enveloped his whereabouts and actions,
and in the Epanchin family the ice of silence once more formed over the
subject."
"Varia, however, informed the girls of what had happened, she
having received the news from Ptitsin, who generally knew more than most
people."
"To make an end, we may say that there were many changes in the Epanchin
household in the spring, so that it was not difficult to forget the
prince, who sent no news of himself."
"The Epanchin family had at last made up their minds to spend the summer
abroad, all except the general, who could not waste time in “travelling
for enjoyment,” of course."
"This arrangement was brought about by the
persistence of the girls, who insisted that they were never allowed
to go abroad because their parents were too anxious to marry them off."
"Perhaps their parents had at last come to the conclusion that husbands
might be found abroad, and that a summer’s travel might bear fruit."
"The
marriage between Alexandra and Totski had been broken off."
"Since the
prince’s departure from St. Petersburg no more had been said about it;
the subject had been dropped without ceremony, much to the joy of Mrs.
General, who, announced that she was “ready to cross herself with both
hands” in gratitude for the escape."
"The general, however, regretted
Totski for a long while."
"“Such a fortune!” he sighed, “and such a good,
easy-going fellow!”

After a time it became known that Totski had married a French marquise,
and was to be carried off by her to Paris, and then to Brittany."
"“Oh, well,” thought the general, “he’s lost to us for good, now.”

So the Epanchins prepared to depart for the summer."
"But now another circumstance occurred, which changed all the plans once
more, and again the intended journey was put off, much to the delight of
the general and his spouse."
"A certain Prince S---- arrived in St. Petersburg from Moscow, an eminent
and honourable young man."
"He was one of those active persons who always
find some good work with which to employ themselves."
"Without forcing
himself upon the public notice, modest and unobtrusive, this young
prince was concerned with much that happened in the world in general."
"He had served, at first, in one of the civil departments, had then
attended to matters connected with the local government of provincial
towns, and had of late been a corresponding member of several important
scientific societies."
"He was a man of excellent family and solid means,
about thirty-five years of age."
"Prince S---- made the acquaintance of the general’s family, and
Adelaida, the second girl, made a great impression upon him."
"Towards
the spring he proposed to her, and she accepted him."
"The general and his
wife were delighted."
"The journey abroad was put off, and the wedding was
fixed for a day not very distant."
"The trip abroad might have been enjoyed later on by Mrs. Epanchin and
her two remaining daughters, but for another circumstance."
"It so happened that Prince S---- introduced a distant relation of his
own into the Epanchin family--one Evgenie Pavlovitch, a young officer
of about twenty-eight years of age, whose conquests among the ladies in
Moscow had been proverbial."
"This young gentleman no sooner set eyes on
Aglaya than he became a frequent visitor at the house."
"He was witty,
well-educated, and extremely wealthy, as the general very soon
discovered."
His past reputation was the only thing against him.
"Nothing was said; there were not even any hints dropped; but still, it
seemed better to the parents to say nothing more about going abroad
this season, at all events."
"Aglaya herself perhaps was of a different
opinion."
"All this happened just before the second appearance of our hero upon the
scene."
"By this time, to judge from appearances, poor Prince Muishkin had been
quite forgotten in St. Petersburg."
"If he had appeared suddenly among his
acquaintances, he would have been received as one from the skies; but we
must just glance at one more fact before we conclude this preface."
"Colia Ivolgin, for some time after the prince’s departure, continued his
old life."
"That is, he went to school, looked after his father, helped
Varia in the house, and ran her errands, and went frequently to see his
friend, Hippolyte."
"The lodgers had disappeared very quickly--Ferdishenko soon after the
events at Nastasia Philipovna’s, while the prince went to Moscow, as
we know."
"Gania and his mother went to live with Varia and Ptitsin
immediately after the latter’s wedding, while the general was housed
in a debtor’s prison by reason of certain IOU’s given to the captain’s
widow under the impression that they would never be formally
used against him."
"This unkind action much surprised poor Ardalion
Alexandrovitch, the victim, as he called himself, of an “unbounded trust
in the nobility of the human heart.”

When he signed those notes of hand he never dreamt that they would be a
source of future trouble."
The event showed that he was mistaken.
"“Trust
in anyone after this!"
"Have the least confidence in man or woman!” he
cried in bitter tones, as he sat with his new friends in prison, and
recounted to them his favourite stories of the siege of Kars, and the
resuscitated soldier."
"On the whole, he accommodated himself very well
to his new position."
"Ptitsin and Varia declared that he was in the right
place, and Gania was of the same opinion."
"The only person who deplored
his fate was poor Nina Alexandrovna, who wept bitter tears over him,
to the great surprise of her household, and, though always in feeble
health, made a point of going to see him as often as possible."
"Since the general’s “mishap,” as Colia called it, and the marriage of
his sister, the boy had quietly possessed himself of far more freedom."
"His relations saw little of him, for he rarely slept at home."
"He made
many new friends; and was moreover, a frequent visitor at the debtor’s
prison, to which he invariably accompanied his mother."
"Varia, who used
to be always correcting him, never spoke to him now on the subject of
his frequent absences, and the whole household was surprised to see
Gania, in spite of his depression, on quite friendly terms with his
brother."
"This was something new, for Gania had been wont to look upon
Colia as a kind of errand-boy, treating him with contempt, threatening
to “pull his ears,” and in general driving him almost wild with
irritation."
"It seemed now that Gania really needed his brother, and the
latter, for his part, felt as if he could forgive Gania much since he
had returned the hundred thousand roubles offered to him by Nastasia
Philipovna."
"Three months after the departure of the prince, the Ivolgin
family discovered that Colia had made acquaintance with the Epanchins,
and was on very friendly terms with the daughters."
"Varia heard of it
first, though Colia had not asked her to introduce him."
"Little by little
the family grew quite fond of him."
"Madame Epanchin at first looked on
him with disdain, and received him coldly, but in a short time he
grew to please her, because, as she said, he “was candid and no
flatterer”--a very true description."
"From the first he put himself
on an equality with his new friends, and though he sometimes read
newspapers and books to the mistress of the house, it was simply because
he liked to be useful."
"One day, however, he and Lizabetha Prokofievna quarrelled seriously
about the “woman question,” in the course of a lively discussion on that
burning subject."
"He told her that she was a tyrant, and that he would
never set foot in her house again."
"It may seem incredible, but a day
or two after, Madame Epanchin sent a servant with a note begging him to
return, and Colia, without standing on his dignity, did so at once."
"Aglaya was the only one of the family whose good graces he could not
gain, and who always spoke to him haughtily, but it so happened that the
boy one day succeeded in giving the proud maiden a surprise."
"It was about Easter, when, taking advantage of a momentary tête-à-tête
Colia handed Aglaya a letter, remarking that he “had orders to deliver
it to her privately.” She stared at him in amazement, but he did not
wait to hear what she had to say, and went out."
"Aglaya broke the seal,
and read as follows:

“Once you did me the honour of giving me your confidence."
"Perhaps you
have quite forgotten me now!"
How is it that I am writing to you?
"I do
not know; but I am conscious of an irresistible desire to remind you of
my existence, especially you."
"How many times I have needed all three of
you; but only you have dwelt always in my mind’s eye."
"I need you--I need
you very much."
I will not write about myself.
"I have nothing to tell
you."
But I long for you to be happy.
_Are_ you happy?
"That is all I wished
to say to you--Your brother,

“PR."
"L. MUISHKIN.”

On reading this short and disconnected note, Aglaya suddenly blushed all
over, and became very thoughtful."
It would be difficult to describe her thoughts at that moment.
"One of
them was, “Shall I show it to anyone?” But she was ashamed to show it."
"So she ended by hiding it in her table drawer, with a very strange,
ironical smile upon her lips."
"Next day, she took it out, and put it into a large book, as she usually
did with papers which she wanted to be able to find easily."
"She laughed
when, about a week later, she happened to notice the name of the book,
and saw that it was Don Quixote, but it would be difficult to say
exactly why."
"I cannot say, either, whether she showed the letter to her sisters."
"But when she had read it herself once more, it suddenly struck her
that surely that conceited boy, Colia, had not been the one chosen
correspondent of the prince all this while."
"She determined to ask him,
and did so with an exaggerated show of carelessness."
"He informed her
haughtily that though he had given the prince his permanent address when
the latter left town, and had offered his services, the prince had never
before given him any commission to perform, nor had he written until the
following lines arrived, with Aglaya’s letter."
"Aglaya took the note, and
read it."
"“DEAR COLIA,--Please be so kind as to give the enclosed sealed letter to
Aglaya Ivanovna."
"Keep well--Ever your loving,

“PR."
"L. MUISHKIN.”


“It seems absurd to trust a little pepper-box like you,” said Aglaya,
as she returned the note, and walked past the “pepper-box” with an
expression of great contempt."
This was more than Colia could bear.
"He had actually borrowed Gania’s
new green tie for the occasion, without saying why he wanted it, in
order to impress her."
He was very deeply mortified.
II.
"It was the beginning of June, and for a whole week the weather in
St. Petersburg had been magnificent."
"The Epanchins had a luxurious
country-house at Pavlofsk, [One of the fashionable summer resorts near
St."
Petersburg.]
"and to this spot Mrs. Epanchin determined to proceed
without further delay."
"In a couple of days all was ready, and the family
had left town."
"A day or two after this removal to Pavlofsk, Prince
Muishkin arrived in St. Petersburg by the morning train from Moscow."
"No
one met him; but, as he stepped out of the carriage, he suddenly became
aware of two strangely glowing eyes fixed upon him from among the crowd
that met the train."
"On endeavouring to re-discover the eyes, and see
to whom they belonged, he could find nothing to guide him."
"It must have
been a hallucination."
"But the disagreeable impression remained, and
without this, the prince was sad and thoughtful already, and seemed to
be much preoccupied."
His cab took him to a small and bad hotel near the Litaynaya.
"Here
he engaged a couple of rooms, dark and badly furnished."
"He washed and
changed, and hurriedly left the hotel again, as though anxious to
waste no time."
"Anyone who now saw him for the first time since he
left Petersburg would judge that he had improved vastly so far as his
exterior was concerned."
"His clothes certainly were very different; they
were more fashionable, perhaps even too much so, and anyone inclined to
mockery might have found something to smile at in his appearance."
"But
what is there that people will not smile at?"
"The prince took a cab and drove to a street near the Nativity, where he
soon discovered the house he was seeking."
"It was a small wooden villa,
and he was struck by its attractive and clean appearance; it stood in
a pleasant little garden, full of flowers."
"The windows looking on the
street were open, and the sound of a voice, reading aloud or making
a speech, came through them."
"It rose at times to a shout, and was
interrupted occasionally by bursts of laughter."
"Prince Muishkin entered the court-yard, and ascended the steps."
"A cook
with her sleeves turned up to the elbows opened the door."
"The visitor
asked if Mr. Lebedeff were at home."
"“He is in there,” said she, pointing to the salon."
"The room had a blue wall-paper, and was well, almost pretentiously,
furnished, with its round table, its divan, and its bronze clock under
a glass shade."
"There was a narrow pier-glass against the wall, and a
chandelier adorned with lustres hung by a bronze chain from the ceiling."
"When the prince entered, Lebedeff was standing in the middle of the
room, his back to the door."
"He was in his shirt-sleeves, on account of
the extreme heat, and he seemed to have just reached the peroration of
his speech, and was impressively beating his breast."
"His audience consisted of a youth of about fifteen years of age with a
clever face, who had a book in his hand, though he was not reading; a
young lady of twenty, in deep mourning, stood near him with an infant in
her arms; another girl of thirteen, also in black, was laughing loudly,
her mouth wide open; and on the sofa lay a handsome young man,
with black hair and eyes, and a suspicion of beard and whiskers."
"He
frequently interrupted the speaker and argued with him, to the great
delight of the others."
“Lukian Timofeyovitch!
Lukian Timofeyovitch!
Here’s someone to see you!
Look here!...
a gentleman to speak to you!...
"Well, it’s not my fault!”
 and the cook turned and went away red with anger."
"Lebedeff started, and at sight of the prince stood like a statue for a
moment."
"Then he moved up to him with an ingratiating smile, but stopped
short again."
“Prince!
ex-ex-excellency!” he stammered.
"Then suddenly he ran towards
the girl with the infant, a movement so unexpected by her that she
staggered and fell back, but next moment he was threatening the other
child, who was standing, still laughing, in the doorway."
"She screamed,
and ran towards the kitchen."
"Lebedeff stamped his foot angrily;
then, seeing the prince regarding him with amazement, he murmured
apologetically--“Pardon to show respect!..."
"he-he!”

“You are quite wrong...” began the prince."
"“At once... at once... in one moment!”

He rushed like a whirlwind from the room, and Muishkin looked
inquiringly at the others."
"They were all laughing, and the guest joined in the chorus."
"“He has gone to get his coat,” said the boy."
“How annoying!” exclaimed the prince.
"“I thought... Tell me, is he...”

“You think he is drunk?” cried the young man on the sofa."
"“Not in the
least."
"He’s only had three or four small glasses, perhaps five; but what
is that?"
"The usual thing!”

As the prince opened his mouth to answer, he was interrupted by the
girl, whose sweet face wore an expression of absolute frankness."
"“He never drinks much in the morning; if you have come to talk business
with him, do it now."
It is the best time.
"He sometimes comes back drunk
in the evening; but just now he passes the greater part of the evening
in tears, and reads passages of Holy Scripture aloud, because our mother
died five weeks ago.”

“No doubt he ran off because he did not know what to say to you,”
 said the youth on the divan."
"“I bet he is trying to cheat you, and is
thinking how best to do it.”

Just then Lebedeff returned, having put on his coat."
"“Five weeks!” said he, wiping his eyes."
“Only five weeks!
"Poor orphans!”

“But why wear a coat in holes,” asked the girl, “when your new one is
hanging behind the door?"
"Did you not see it?”

“Hold your tongue, dragon-fly!” he scolded."
"“What a plague you are!” He
stamped his foot irritably, but she only laughed, and answered:

“Are you trying to frighten me?"
"I am not Tania, you know, and I don’t
intend to run away."
"Look, you are waking Lubotchka, and she will have
convulsions again."
"Why do you shout like that?”

“Well, well!"
"I won’t again,” said the master of the house, his anxiety
getting the better of his temper."
"He went up to his daughter, and looked
at the child in her arms, anxiously making the sign of the cross over
her three times."
“God bless her!
God bless her!” he cried with emotion.
"“This little creature is my daughter Luboff,” addressing the prince."
"“My
wife, Helena, died--at her birth; and this is my big daughter Vera, in
mourning, as you see; and this, this, oh, this,” pointing to the young man
on the divan...

“Well, go on!"
never mind me!” mocked the other.
"“Don’t be afraid!”

“Excellency!"
"Have you read that account of the murder of the Zemarin
family, in the newspaper?” cried Lebedeff, all of a sudden."
"“Yes,” said Muishkin, with some surprise."
"“Well, that is the murderer!"
"It is he--in fact--”

“What do you mean?” asked the visitor."
"“I am speaking allegorically, of course; but he will be the murderer of
a Zemarin family in the future."
He is getting ready.
"...”

They all laughed, and the thought crossed the prince’s mind that perhaps
Lebedeff was really trifling in this way because he foresaw inconvenient
questions, and wanted to gain time."
“He is a traitor!
"a conspirator!” shouted Lebedeff, who seemed to have
lost all control over himself."
“A monster!
a slanderer!
"Ought I to treat
him as a nephew, the son of my sister Anisia?”

“Oh!"
do be quiet!
You must be drunk!
"He has taken it into his head to
play the lawyer, prince, and he practices speechifying, and is always
repeating his eloquent pleadings to his children."
"And who do you think
was his last client?"
"An old woman who had been robbed of five hundred
roubles, her all, by some rogue of a usurer, besought him to take up
her case, instead of which he defended the usurer himself, a Jew named
Zeidler, because this Jew promised to give him fifty roubles....”

“It was to be fifty if I won the case, only five if I lost,” interrupted
Lebedeff, speaking in a low tone, a great contrast to his earlier
manner."
“Well!
"naturally he came to grief: the law is not administered as it
used to be, and he only got laughed at for his pains."
"But he was much
pleased with himself in spite of that."
"‘Most learned judge!’ said he,
‘picture this unhappy man, crippled by age and infirmities, who gains
his living by honourable toil--picture him, I repeat, robbed of his all,
of his last mouthful; remember, I entreat you, the words of that learned
legislator, “Let mercy and justice alike rule the courts of law.”’ Now,
would you believe it, excellency, every morning he recites this
speech to us from beginning to end, exactly as he spoke it before the
magistrate."
To-day we have heard it for the fifth time.
"He was just
starting again when you arrived, so much does he admire it."
"He is now
preparing to undertake another case."
"I think, by the way, that you are
Prince Muishkin?"
"Colia tells me you are the cleverest man he has ever
known....”

“The cleverest in the world,” interrupted his uncle hastily."
"“I do not pay much attention to that opinion,” continued the young man
calmly."
"“Colia is very fond of you, but he,” pointing to Lebedeff, “is
flattering you."
"I can assure you I have no intention of flattering you,
or anyone else, but at least you have some common-sense."
"Well, will you
judge between us?"
"Shall we ask the prince to act as arbitrator?” he went
on, addressing his uncle."
"“I am so glad you chanced to come here, prince.”

“I agree,” said Lebedeff, firmly, looking round involuntarily at his
daughter, who had come nearer, and was listening attentively to the
conversation."
"“What is it all about?” asked the prince, frowning."
"His head ached, and
he felt sure that Lebedeff was trying to cheat him in some way, and only
talking to put off the explanation that he had come for."
“I will tell you all the story.
"I am his nephew; he did speak the truth
there, although he is generally telling lies."
"I am at the University,
and have not yet finished my course."
"I mean to do so, and I shall, for
I have a determined character."
"I must, however, find something to do
for the present, and therefore I have got employment on the railway at
twenty-four roubles a month."
"I admit that my uncle has helped me once
or twice before."
"Well, I had twenty roubles in my pocket, and I gambled
them away."
"Can you believe that I should be so low, so base, as to lose
money in that way?”

“And the man who won it is a rogue, a rogue whom you ought not to have
paid!” cried Lebedeff."
"“Yes, he is a rogue, but I was obliged to pay him,” said the young man."
"“As to his being a rogue, he is assuredly that, and I am not saying it
because he beat you."
"He is an ex-lieutenant, prince, dismissed from the
service, a teacher of boxing, and one of Rogojin’s followers."
"They are
all lounging about the pavements now that Rogojin has turned them off."
"Of course, the worst of it is that, knowing he was a rascal, and a
card-sharper, I none the less played palki with him, and risked my last
rouble."
"To tell the truth, I thought to myself, ‘If I lose, I will go
to my uncle, and I am sure he will not refuse to help me.’ Now that was
base--cowardly and base!”

“That is so,” observed Lebedeff quietly; “cowardly and base.”

“Well, wait a bit, before you begin to triumph,” said the nephew
viciously; for the words seemed to irritate him."
“He is delighted!
"I
came to him here and told him everything: I acted honourably, for I did
not excuse myself."
"I spoke most severely of my conduct, as everyone here
can witness."
"But I must smarten myself up before I take up my new post,
for I am really like a tramp."
Just look at my boots!
"I cannot possibly
appear like this, and if I am not at the bureau at the time appointed,
the job will be given to someone else; and I shall have to try for
another."
"Now I only beg for fifteen roubles, and I give my word that
I will never ask him for anything again."
"I am also ready to promise to
repay my debt in three months’ time, and I will keep my word, even if I
have to live on bread and water."
"My salary will amount to seventy-five
roubles in three months."
"The sum I now ask, added to what I have
borrowed already, will make a total of about thirty-five roubles, so
you see I shall have enough to pay him and confound him!"
"if he wants
interest, he shall have that, too!"
"Haven’t I always paid back the money
he lent me before?"
Why should he be so mean now?
"He grudges my having
paid that lieutenant; there can be no other reason!"
"That’s the kind he
is--a dog in the manger!”

“And he won’t go away!” cried Lebedeff."
"“He has installed himself here,
and here he remains!”

“I have told you already, that I will not go away until I have got what
I ask."
"Why are you smiling, prince?"
"You look as if you disapproved of
me.”

“I am not smiling, but I really think you are in the wrong, somewhat,”
 replied Muishkin, reluctantly."
“Don’t shuffle!
"Say plainly that you think that I am quite wrong,
without any ‘somewhat’!"
"Why ‘somewhat’?”

“I will say you are quite wrong, if you wish.”

“If I wish!"
"That’s good, I must say!"
"Do you think I am deceived as to
the flagrant impropriety of my conduct?"
"I am quite aware that his money
is his own, and that my action--is much like an attempt at extortion."
But you-you don’t know what life is!
"If people don’t learn by
experience, they never understand."
They must be taught.
"My intentions
are perfectly honest; on my conscience he will lose nothing, and I will
pay back the money with interest."
"Added to which he has had the moral
satisfaction of seeing me disgraced."
What does he want more?
"and what
is he good for if he never helps anyone?"
Look what he does himself!
"just
ask him about his dealings with others, how he deceives people!"
"How did
he manage to buy this house?"
"You may cut off my head if he has not let
you in for something--and if he is not trying to cheat you again."
"You are
smiling."
"You don’t believe me?”

“It seems to me that all this has nothing to do with your affairs,”
 remarked the prince."
"“I have lain here now for three days,” cried the young man without
noticing, “and I have seen a lot!"
Fancy!
"he suspects his daughter, that
angel, that orphan, my cousin--he suspects her, and every evening he
searches her room, to see if she has a lover hidden in it!"
"He comes
here too on tiptoe, creeping softly--oh, so softly--and looks under the
sofa--my bed, you know."
"He is mad with suspicion, and sees a thief in
every corner."
"He runs about all night long; he was up at least seven
times last night, to satisfy himself that the windows and doors were
barred, and to peep into the oven."
"That man who appears in court for
scoundrels, rushes in here in the night and prays, lying prostrate,
banging his head on the ground by the half-hour--and for whom do you
think he prays?"
Who are the sinners figuring in his drunken petitions?
"I have heard him with my own ears praying for the repose of the soul
of the Countess du Barry!"
Colia heard it too.
"He is as mad as a March
hare!”

“You hear how he slanders me, prince,” said Lebedeff, almost beside
himself with rage."
"“I may be a drunkard, an evil-doer, a thief, but at
least I can say one thing for myself."
"He does not know--how should he,
mocker that he is?--that when he came into the world it was I who washed
him, and dressed him in his swathing-bands, for my sister Anisia had
lost her husband, and was in great poverty."
"I was very little better
off than she, but I sat up night after night with her, and nursed both
mother and child; I used to go downstairs and steal wood for them from
the house-porter."
"How often did I sing him to sleep when I was half dead
with hunger!"
"In short, I was more than a father to him, and now--now he
jeers at me!"
"Even if I did cross myself, and pray for the repose of the
soul of the Comtesse du Barry, what does it matter?"
"Three days ago,
for the first time in my life, I read her biography in an historical
dictionary."
Do you know who she was?
You there!” addressing his nephew.
“Speak!
"do you know?”

“Of course no one knows anything about her but you,” muttered the young
man in a would-be jeering tone."
“She was a Countess who rose from shame to reign like a Queen.
"An
Empress wrote to her, with her own hand, as ‘_Ma chère cousine_.’ At
a _lever-du-roi_ one morning (do you know what a _lever-du-roi_ was?)"
"--a
Cardinal, a Papal legate, offered to put on her stockings; a high and
holy person like that looked on it as an honour!"
Did you know this?
"I
see by your expression that you did not!"
"Well, how did she die?"
"Answer!”

“Oh!"
"do stop--you are too absurd!”

“This is how she died."
"After all this honour and glory, after having
been almost a Queen, she was guillotined by that butcher, Samson."
"She
was quite innocent, but it had to be done, for the satisfaction of the
fishwives of Paris."
"She was so terrified, that she did not understand
what was happening."
"But when Samson seized her head, and pushed her
under the knife with his foot, she cried out: ‘Wait a moment!"
"wait a
moment, monsieur!’ Well, because of that moment of bitter suffering,
perhaps the Saviour will pardon her other faults, for one cannot imagine
a greater agony."
As I read the story my heart bled for her.
"And what
does it matter to you, little worm, if I implored the Divine mercy for
her, great sinner as she was, as I said my evening prayer?"
"I might have
done it because I doubted if anyone had ever crossed himself for her
sake before."
"It may be that in the other world she will rejoice to think
that a sinner like herself has cried to heaven for the salvation of her
soul."
Why are you laughing?
"You believe nothing, atheist!"
"And your story
was not even correct!"
"If you had listened to what I was saying, you
would have heard that I did not only pray for the Comtesse du Barry."
"I
said, ‘Oh Lord!"
"give rest to the soul of that great sinner, the Comtesse
du Barry, and to all unhappy ones like her.’ You see that is quite a
different thing, for how many sinners there are, how many women, who
have passed through the trials of this life, are now suffering and
groaning in purgatory!"
"I prayed for you, too, in spite of your insolence
and impudence, also for your fellows, as it seems that you claim to know
how I pray...”

“Oh!"
that’s enough in all conscience!
"Pray for whom you choose, and the
devil take them and you!"
"We have a scholar here; you did not know that,
prince?” he continued, with a sneer."
"“He reads all sorts of books and
memoirs now.”

“At any rate, your uncle has a kind heart,” remarked the prince, who
really had to force himself to speak to the nephew, so much did he
dislike him."
"“Oh, now you are going to praise him!"
He will be set up!
"He puts his
hand on his heart, and he is delighted!"
"I never said he was a man
without heart, but he is a rascal--that’s the pity of it."
"And then, he
is addicted to drink, and his mind is unhinged, like that of most
people who have taken more than is good for them for years."
"He loves his
children--oh, I know that well enough!"
"He respected my aunt, his late
wife... and he even has a sort of affection for me."
"He has remembered me
in his will.”

“I shall leave you nothing!” exclaimed his uncle angrily."
"“Listen to me, Lebedeff,” said the prince in a decided voice, turning
his back on the young man."
"“I know by experience that when you choose,
you can be business-like..."
"I have very little time to spare, and
if you... By the way--excuse me--what is your Christian name?"
"I have
forgotten it.”

“Ti-Ti-Timofey.”

“And?”

“Lukianovitch.”

Everyone in the room began to laugh."
“He is telling lies!” cried the nephew.
"“Even now he cannot speak
the truth."
"He is not called Timofey Lukianovitch, prince, but Lukian
Timofeyovitch."
Now do tell us why you must needs lie about it?
"Lukian or
Timofey, it is all the same to you, and what difference can it make to
the prince?"
"He tells lies without the least necessity, simply by force
of habit, I assure you.”

“Is that true?” said the prince impatiently."
"“My name really is Lukian Timofeyovitch,” acknowledged Lebedeff,
lowering his eyes, and putting his hand on his heart."
"“Well, for God’s sake, what made you say the other?”

“To humble myself,” murmured Lebedeff."
“What on earth do you mean?
"Oh I if only I knew where Colia was at this
moment!” cried the prince, standing up, as if to go."
"“I can tell you all about Colia,” said the young man

“Oh!"
"no, no!” said Lebedeff, hurriedly."
"“Colia spent the night here, and this morning went after his father,
whom you let out of prison by paying his debts--Heaven only knows why!"
"Yesterday the general promised to come and lodge here, but he did not
appear."
Most probably he slept at the hotel close by.
"No doubt Colia
is there, unless he has gone to Pavlofsk to see the Epanchins."
"He had a
little money, and was intending to go there yesterday."
"He must be either
at the hotel or at Pavlofsk.”

“At Pavlofsk!"
"He is at Pavlofsk, undoubtedly!” interrupted Lebedeff....
“But come--let us go into the garden--we will have coffee there....” And
Lebedeff seized the prince’s arm, and led him from the room."
"They went
across the yard, and found themselves in a delightful little garden
with the trees already in their summer dress of green, thanks to the
unusually fine weather."
"Lebedeff invited his guest to sit down on a
green seat before a table of the same colour fixed in the earth, and
took a seat facing him."
"In a few minutes the coffee appeared, and the
prince did not refuse it."
"The host kept his eyes fixed on Muishkin, with
an expression of passionate servility."
"“I knew nothing about your home before,” said the prince absently, as if
he were thinking of something else."
"“Poor orphans,” began Lebedeff, his face assuming a mournful air, but he
stopped short, for the other looked at him inattentively, as if he had
already forgotten his own remark."
"They waited a few minutes in silence,
while Lebedeff sat with his eyes fixed mournfully on the young man’s
face."
"“Well!” said the latter, at last rousing himself."
“Ah!
yes!
"You know why
I came, Lebedeff."
Your letter brought me.
Speak!
"Tell me all about it.”

The clerk, rather confused, tried to say something, hesitated, began to
speak, and again stopped."
The prince looked at him gravely.
"“I think I understand, Lukian Timofeyovitch: you were not sure that I
should come."
"You did not think I should start at the first word from
you, and you merely wrote to relieve your conscience."
"However, you
see now that I have come, and I have had enough of trickery."
"Give up
serving, or trying to serve, two masters."
"Rogojin has been here these
three weeks."
Have you managed to sell her to him as you did before?
"Tell
me the truth.”

“He discovered everything, the monster... himself......”

“Don’t abuse him; though I dare say you have something to complain
of....”

“He beat me, he thrashed me unmercifully!” replied Lebedeff vehemently."
"“He set a dog on me in Moscow, a bloodhound, a terrible beast that
chased me all down the street.”

“You seem to take me for a child, Lebedeff."
"Tell me, is it a fact that
she left him while they were in Moscow?”

“Yes, it is a fact, and this time, let me tell you, on the very eve of
their marriage!"
"It was a question of minutes when she slipped off to
Petersburg."
"She came to me directly she arrived--‘Save me, Lukian!"
"find
me some refuge, and say nothing to the prince!’ She is afraid of you,
even more than she is of him, and in that she shows her wisdom!” And
Lebedeff slily put his finger to his brow as he said the last words."
"“And now it is you who have brought them together again?”

“Excellency, how could I, how could I prevent it?”

“That will do."
I can find out for myself.
"Only tell me, where is she
now?"
At his house?
"With him?”

“Oh no!"
Certainly not!
"‘I am free,’ she says; you know how she insists
on that point."
‘I am entirely free.’ She repeats it over and over again.
"She is living in Petersburgskaia, with my sister-in-law, as I told you
in my letter.”

“She is there at this moment?”

“Yes, unless she has gone to Pavlofsk: the fine weather may have tempted
her, perhaps, into the country, with Daria Alexeyevna."
"‘I am quite
free,’ she says."
"Only yesterday she boasted of her freedom to Nicolai
Ardalionovitch--a bad sign,” added Lebedeff, smiling."
"“Colia goes to see her often, does he not?”

“He is a strange boy, thoughtless, and inclined to be indiscreet.”

“Is it long since you saw her?”

“I go to see her every day, every day.”

“Then you were there yesterday?”

“N-no: I have not been these three last days.”

“It is a pity you have taken too much wine, Lebedeff I want to ask you
something... but...”

“All right!"
all right!
"I am not drunk,” replied the clerk, preparing to
listen."
"“Tell me, how was she when you left her?”

“She is a woman who is seeking...”

“Seeking?”

“She seems always to be searching about, as if she had lost something."
"The mere idea of her coming marriage disgusts her; she looks on it as
an insult."
"She cares as much for _him_ as for a piece of orange-peel--not
more."
"Yet I am much mistaken if she does not look on him with fear and
trembling."
"She forbids his name to be mentioned before her, and they
only meet when unavoidable."
"He understands, well enough!"
"But it must be
gone through."
"She is restless, mocking, deceitful, violent....”

“Deceitful and violent?”

“Yes, violent."
I can give you a proof of it.
"A few days ago she tried
to pull my hair because I said something that annoyed her."
"I tried to
soothe her by reading the Apocalypse aloud.”

“What?” exclaimed the prince, thinking he had not heard aright."
“By reading the Apocalypse.
"The lady has a restless imagination, he-he!"
"She has a liking for conversation on serious subjects, of any kind; in
fact they please her so much, that it flatters her to discuss them."
"Now
for fifteen years at least I have studied the Apocalypse, and she agrees
with me in thinking that the present is the epoch represented by the
third horse, the black one whose rider holds a measure in his hand."
"It
seems to me that everything is ruled by measure in our century; all men
are clamouring for their rights; ‘a measure of wheat for a penny, and
three measures of barley for a penny.’ But, added to this, men desire
freedom of mind and body, a pure heart, a healthy life, and all God’s
good gifts."
"Now by pleading their rights alone, they will never attain
all this, so the white horse, with his rider Death, comes next, and
is followed by Hell."
"We talked about this matter when we met, and it
impressed her very much.”

“Do you believe all this?” asked Muishkin, looking curiously at his
companion."
“I both believe it and explain it.
"I am but a poor creature, a beggar,
an atom in the scale of humanity."
"Who has the least respect for
Lebedeff?"
"He is a target for all the world, the butt of any fool who
chooses to kick him."
"But in interpreting revelation I am the equal
of anyone, great as he may be!"
"Such is the power of the mind and
the spirit."
"I have made a lordly personage tremble, as he sat in his
armchair... only by talking to him of things concerning the spirit."
"Two years ago, on Easter Eve, His Excellency Nil Alexeyovitch, whose
subordinate I was then, wished to hear what I had to say, and sent a
message by Peter Zakkaritch to ask me to go to his private room."
"‘They
tell me you expound the prophecies relating to Antichrist,’ said he,
when we were alone."
"‘Is that so?’ ‘Yes,’ I answered unhesitatingly, and
I began to give some comments on the Apostle’s allegorical vision."
"At
first he smiled, but when we reached the numerical computations and
correspondences, he trembled, and turned pale."
"Then he begged me to
close the book, and sent me away, promising to put my name on the reward
list."
"That took place as I said on the eve of Easter, and eight days
later his soul returned to God.”

“What?”

“It is the truth."
"One evening after dinner he stumbled as he stepped
out of his carriage."
"He fell, and struck his head on the curb, and died
immediately."
"He was seventy-three years of age, and had a red face, and
white hair; he deluged himself with scent, and was always smiling like
a child."
"Peter Zakkaritch recalled my interview with him, and said, ‘_you
foretold his death._’”

The prince rose from his seat, and Lebedeff, surprised to see his
guest preparing to go so soon, remarked: “You are not interested?” in a
respectful tone."
"“I am not very well, and my head aches."
"Doubtless the effect of the
journey,” replied the prince, frowning."
"“You should go into the country,” said Lebedeff timidly."
The prince seemed to be considering the suggestion.
"“You see, I am going into the country myself in three days, with my
children and belongings."
"The little one is delicate; she needs change
of air; and during our absence this house will be done up."
"I am going to
Pavlofsk.”

“You are going to Pavlofsk too?” asked the prince sharply."
"“Everybody
seems to be going there."
"Have you a house in that neighbourhood?”

“I don’t know of many people going to Pavlofsk, and as for the house,
Ivan Ptitsin has let me one of his villas rather cheaply."
"It is a
pleasant place, lying on a hill surrounded by trees, and one can live
there for a mere song."
"There is good music to be heard, so no wonder it
is popular."
I shall stay in the lodge.
"As to the villa itself...”

“Have you let it?”

“N-no--not exactly.”

“Let it to me,” said the prince."
"Now this was precisely what Lebedeff had made up his mind to do in the
last three minutes."
"Not that he had any difficulty in finding a tenant;
in fact the house was occupied at present by a chance visitor, who had
told Lebedeff that he would perhaps take it for the summer months."
"The
clerk knew very well that this “_perhaps_” meant “_certainly_,” but as he
thought he could make more out of a tenant like the prince, he felt
justified in speaking vaguely about the present inhabitant’s intentions."
"“This is quite a coincidence,” thought he, and when the subject of price
was mentioned, he made a gesture with his hand, as if to waive away a
question of so little importance."
"“Oh well, as you like!” said Muishkin."
“I will think it over.
"You shall
lose nothing!”

They were walking slowly across the garden."
“But if you...
"I could...” stammered Lebedeff, “if... if you please,
prince, tell you something on the subject which would interest you, I am
sure.” He spoke in wheedling tones, and wriggled as he walked along."
Muishkin stopped short.
"“Daria Alexeyevna also has a villa at Pavlofsk.”

“Well?”

“A certain person is very friendly with her, and intends to visit her
pretty often.”

“Well?”

“Aglaya Ivanovna...”

“Oh stop, Lebedeff!” interposed Muishkin, feeling as if he had been
touched on an open wound."
“That... that has nothing to do with me.
"I
should like to know when you are going to start."
"The sooner the better
as far as I am concerned, for I am at an hotel.”

They had left the garden now, and were crossing the yard on their way to
the gate."
"“Well, leave your hotel at once and come here; then we can all go
together to Pavlofsk the day after tomorrow.”

“I will think about it,” said the prince dreamily, and went off."
"The clerk stood looking after his guest, struck by his sudden
absent-mindedness."
"He had not even remembered to say goodbye, and
Lebedeff was the more surprised at the omission, as he knew by
experience how courteous the prince usually was."
III.
It was now close on twelve o’clock.
"The prince knew that if he called at the Epanchins’ now he would only
find the general, and that the latter might probably carry him straight
off to Pavlofsk with him; whereas there was one visit he was most
anxious to make without delay."
"So at the risk of missing General Epanchin altogether, and thus
postponing his visit to Pavlofsk for a day, at least, the prince decided
to go and look for the house he desired to find."
"The visit he was about to pay was, in some respects, a risky one."
"He was
in two minds about it, but knowing that the house was in the Gorohovaya,
not far from the Sadovaya, he determined to go in that direction, and to
try to make up his mind on the way."
"Arrived at the point where the Gorohovaya crosses the Sadovaya, he was
surprised to find how excessively agitated he was."
"He had no idea that
his heart could beat so painfully."
"One house in the Gorohovaya began to attract his attention long before
he reached it, and the prince remembered afterwards that he had said
to himself: “That is the house, I’m sure of it.” He came up to it quite
curious to discover whether he had guessed right, and felt that he would
be disagreeably impressed to find that he had actually done so."
"The
house was a large gloomy-looking structure, without the slightest claim
to architectural beauty, in colour a dirty green."
"There are a few of
these old houses, built towards the end of the last century, still
standing in that part of St. Petersburg, and showing little change
from their original form and colour."
"They are solidly built, and are
remarkable for the thickness of their walls, and for the fewness
of their windows, many of which are covered by gratings."
"On the
ground-floor there is usually a money-changer’s shop, and the owner
lives over it."
"Without as well as within, the houses seem inhospitable
and mysterious--an impression which is difficult to explain, unless it
has something to do with the actual architectural style."
"These houses
are almost exclusively inhabited by the merchant class."
"Arrived at the gate, the prince looked up at the legend over it, which
ran:

“House of Rogojin, hereditary and honourable citizen.”

He hesitated no longer; but opened the glazed door at the bottom of the
outer stairs and made his way up to the second storey."
"The place was
dark and gloomy-looking; the walls of the stone staircase were painted
a dull red."
"Rogojin and his mother and brother occupied the whole of
the second floor."
"The servant who opened the door to Muishkin led him,
without taking his name, through several rooms and up and down many
steps until they arrived at a door, where he knocked."
Parfen Rogojin opened the door himself.
"On seeing the prince he became deadly white, and apparently fixed to the
ground, so that he was more like a marble statue than a human being."
"The
prince had expected some surprise, but Rogojin evidently considered his
visit an impossible and miraculous event."
"He stared with an expression
almost of terror, and his lips twisted into a bewildered smile."
“Parfen!
perhaps my visit is ill-timed.
"I--I can go away again if you
like,” said Muishkin at last, rather embarrassed."
"“No, no; it’s all right, come in,” said Parfen, recollecting himself."
They were evidently on quite familiar terms.
"In Moscow they had had many
occasions of meeting; indeed, some few of those meetings were but too
vividly impressed upon their memories."
"They had not met now, however,
for three months."
"The deathlike pallor, and a sort of slight convulsion about the lips,
had not left Rogojin’s face."
"Though he welcomed his guest, he was still
obviously much disturbed."
"As he invited the prince to sit down near the
table, the latter happened to turn towards him, and was startled by the
strange expression on his face."
"A painful recollection flashed into
his mind."
"He stood for a time, looking straight at Rogojin, whose eyes
seemed to blaze like fire."
"At last Rogojin smiled, though he still
looked agitated and shaken."
“What are you staring at me like that for?” he muttered.
"“Sit down.”

The prince took a chair."
"“Parfen,” he said, “tell me honestly, did you know that I was coming to
Petersburg or no?”

“Oh, I supposed you were coming,” the other replied, smiling
sarcastically, “and I was right in my supposition, you see; but how was I
to know that you would come _today?_”

A certain strangeness and impatience in his manner impressed the prince
very forcibly."
"“And if you had known that I was coming today, why be so irritated about
it?” he asked, in quiet surprise."
"“Why did you ask me?”

“Because when I jumped out of the train this morning, two eyes glared at
me just as yours did a moment since.”

“Ha!"
"and whose eyes may they have been?” said Rogojin, suspiciously."
"It
seemed to the prince that he was trembling."
“I don’t know; I thought it was a hallucination.
"I often have
hallucinations nowadays."
"I feel just as I did five years ago when my
fits were about to come on.”

“Well, perhaps it was a hallucination, I don’t know,” said Parfen."
"He tried to give the prince an affectionate smile, and it seemed to the
latter as though in this smile of his something had broken, and that he
could not mend it, try as he would."
"“Shall you go abroad again then?” he asked, and suddenly added, “Do you
remember how we came up in the train from Pskoff together?"
"You and your
cloak and leggings, eh?”

And Rogojin burst out laughing, this time with unconcealed malice, as
though he were glad that he had been able to find an opportunity for
giving vent to it."
"“Have you quite taken up your quarters here?” asked the prince

“Yes, I’m at home."
"Where else should I go to?”

“We haven’t met for some time."
"Meanwhile I have heard things about you
which I should not have believed to be possible.”

“What of that?"
"People will say anything,” said Rogojin drily."
"“At all events, you’ve disbanded your troop--and you are living in your
own house instead of being fast and loose about the place; that’s all
very good."
"Is this house all yours, or joint property?”

“It is my mother’s."
"You get to her apartments by that passage.”

“Where’s your brother?”

“In the other wing.”

“Is he married?”

“Widower."
"Why do you want to know all this?”

The prince looked at him, but said nothing."
"He had suddenly relapsed
into musing, and had probably not heard the question at all."
"Rogojin did
not insist upon an answer, and there was silence for a few moments."
"“I guessed which was your house from a hundred yards off,” said the
prince at last."
"“Why so?”

“I don’t quite know."
"Your house has the aspect of yourself and all your
family; it bears the stamp of the Rogojin life; but ask me why I think
so, and I can tell you nothing."
"It is nonsense, of course."
"I am nervous
about this kind of thing troubling me so much."
"I had never before
imagined what sort of a house you would live in, and yet no sooner did I
set eyes on this one than I said to myself that it must be yours.”

“Really!” said Rogojin vaguely, not taking in what the prince meant by
his rather obscure remarks."
"The room they were now sitting in was a large one, lofty but dark, well
furnished, principally with writing-tables and desks covered with papers
and books."
"A wide sofa covered with red morocco evidently served Rogojin
for a bed."
"On the table beside which the prince had been invited to seat
himself lay some books; one containing a marker where the reader had
left off, was a volume of Solovieff’s History."
"Some oil-paintings in
worn gilded frames hung on the walls, but it was impossible to make out
what subjects they represented, so blackened were they by smoke and age."
"One, a life-sized portrait, attracted the prince’s attention."
"It showed
a man of about fifty, wearing a long riding-coat of German cut."
"He had
two medals on his breast; his beard was white, short and thin; his face
yellow and wrinkled, with a sly, suspicious expression in the eyes."
"“That is your father, is it not?” asked the prince."
"“Yes, it is,” replied Rogojin with an unpleasant smile, as if he
had expected his guest to ask the question, and then to make some
disagreeable remark."
"“Was he one of the Old Believers?”

“No, he went to church, but to tell the truth he really preferred the
old religion."
This was his study and is now mine.
"Why did you ask if he
were an Old Believer?”

“Are you going to be married here?”

“Ye-yes!” replied Rogojin, starting at the unexpected question."
"“Soon?”

“You know yourself it does not depend on me.”

“Parfen, I am not your enemy, and I do not intend to oppose your
intentions in any way."
"I repeat this to you now just as I said it to you
once before on a very similar occasion."
"When you were arranging for your
projected marriage in Moscow, I did not interfere with you--you know I
did not."
"That first time she fled to me from you, from the very altar
almost, and begged me to ‘save her from you.’ Afterwards she ran away
from me again, and you found her and arranged your marriage with her
once more; and now, I hear, she has run away from you and come to
Petersburg."
Is it true?
"Lebedeff wrote me to this effect, and that’s
why I came here."
"That you had once more arranged matters with Nastasia
Philipovna I only learned last night in the train from a friend of
yours, Zaleshoff--if you wish to know."
“I confess I came here with an object.
"I wished to persuade Nastasia
to go abroad for her health; she requires it."
"Both mind and body need a
change badly."
I did not intend to take her abroad myself.
"I was going to
arrange for her to go without me."
"Now I tell you honestly, Parfen, if it
is true that all is made up between you, I will not so much as set eyes
upon her, and I will never even come to see you again."
"“You know quite well that I am telling the truth, because I have always
been frank with you."
I have never concealed my own opinion from you.
"I have always told you that I consider a marriage between you and her
would be ruin to her."
"You would also be ruined, and perhaps even more
hopelessly."
"If this marriage were to be broken off again, I admit I
should be greatly pleased; but at the same time I have not the slightest
intention of trying to part you."
"You may be quite easy in your mind,
and you need not suspect me."
"You know yourself whether I was ever really
your rival or not, even when she ran away and came to me."
"“There, you are laughing at me--I know why you laugh."
"It is perfectly
true that we lived apart from one another all the time, in different
towns."
"I told you before that I did not love her with love, but with
pity!"
"You said then that you understood me; did you really understand
me or not?"
What hatred there is in your eyes at this moment!
"I came
to relieve your mind, because you are dear to me also."
"I love you
very much, Parfen; and now I shall go away and never come back again."
"Goodbye.”

The prince rose."
"“Stay a little,” said Parfen, not leaving his chair and resting his head
on his right hand."
"“I haven’t seen you for a long time.”

The prince sat down again."
Both were silent for a few moments.
"“When you are not with me I hate you, Lef Nicolaievitch."
"I have loathed
you every day of these three months since I last saw you."
"By heaven I
have!” said Rogojin."
“I could have poisoned you at any minute.
"Now, you
have been with me but a quarter of an hour, and all my malice seems to
have melted away, and you are as dear to me as ever."
"Stay here a little
longer.”

“When I am with you you trust me; but as soon as my back is turned you
suspect me,” said the prince, smiling, and trying to hide his emotion."
"“I trust your voice, when I hear you speak."
"I quite understand that you
and I cannot be put on a level, of course.”

“Why did you add that?--There!"
"Now you are cross again,” said the
prince, wondering."
"“We were not asked, you see."
"We were made different, with different
tastes and feelings, without being consulted."
"You say you love her with
pity."
I have no pity for her.
"She hates me--that’s the plain truth of
the matter."
"I dream of her every night, and always that she is laughing
at me with another man."
And so she does laugh at me.
"She thinks no more
of marrying me than if she were changing her shoe."
"Would you believe it,
I haven’t seen her for five days, and I daren’t go near her."
"She asks me
what I come for, as if she were not content with having disgraced me--”

“Disgraced you!"
"How?”

“Just as though you didn’t know!"
"Why, she ran away from me, and went to
you."
"You admitted it yourself, just now.”

“But surely you do not believe that she...”

“That she did not disgrace me at Moscow with that officer, Zemtuznikoff?"
"I know for certain she did, after having fixed our marriage-day
herself!”

“Impossible!” cried the prince."
"“I know it for a fact,” replied Rogojin, with conviction."
"“It is not like her, you say?"
"My friend, that’s absurd."
"Perhaps such an
act would horrify her, if she were with you, but it is quite different
where I am concerned."
She looks on me as vermin.
"Her affair with Keller
was simply to make a laughing-stock of me."
"You don’t know what a fool
she made of me in Moscow; and the money I spent over her!"
The money!
"the
money!”

“And you can marry her now, Parfen!"
"What will come of it all?” said the
prince, with dread in his voice."
"Rogojin gazed back gloomily, and with a terrible expression in his eyes,
but said nothing."
"“I haven’t been to see her for five days,” he repeated, after a slight
pause."
“I’m afraid of being turned out.
"She says she’s still her own
mistress, and may turn me off altogether, and go abroad."
"She told me
this herself,” he said, with a peculiar glance at Muishkin."
"“I think she
often does it merely to frighten me."
"She is always laughing at me, for
some reason or other; but at other times she’s angry, and won’t say a
word, and that’s what I’m afraid of."
"I took her a shawl one day, the
like of which she might never have seen, although she did live in luxury
and she gave it away to her maid, Katia."
"Sometimes when I can keep away
no longer, I steal past the house on the sly, and once I watched at the
gate till dawn--I thought something was going on--and she saw me from
the window."
"She asked me what I should do if I found she had deceived
me."
"I said, ‘You know well enough.’”

“What did she know?” cried the prince."
"“How was I to tell?” replied Rogojin, with an angry laugh."
"“I did my
best to catch her tripping in Moscow, but did not succeed."
"However, I
caught hold of her one day, and said: ‘You are engaged to be married
into a respectable family, and do you know what sort of a woman you are?"
"_That’s_ the sort of woman you are,’ I said.”

“You told her that?”

“Yes.”

“Well, go on.”

“She said, ‘I wouldn’t even have you for a footman now, much less for
a husband.’ ‘I shan’t leave the house,’ I said, ‘so it doesn’t matter.’
‘Then I shall call somebody and have you kicked out,’ she cried."
"So then
I rushed at her, and beat her till she was bruised all over.”

“Impossible!” cried the prince, aghast."
"“I tell you it’s true,” said Rogojin quietly, but with eyes ablaze with
passion."
"“Then for a day and a half I neither slept, nor ate, nor drank, and
would not leave her."
"I knelt at her feet: ‘I shall die here,’ I said,
‘if you don’t forgive me; and if you have me turned out, I shall drown
myself; because, what should I be without you now?’ She was like a
madwoman all that day; now she would cry; now she would threaten me with
a knife; now she would abuse me."
"She called in Zaleshoff and Keller,
and showed me to them, shamed me in their presence."
"‘Let’s all go to
the theatre,’ she says, ‘and leave him here if he won’t go--it’s not
my business."
"They’ll give you some tea, Parfen Semeonovitch, while I
am away, for you must be hungry.’ She came back from the theatre alone."
"‘Those cowards wouldn’t come,’ she said."
"‘They are afraid of you, and
tried to frighten me, too."
"“He won’t go away as he came,” they said,
“he’ll cut your throat--see if he doesn’t.” Now, I shall go to my
bedroom, and I shall not even lock my door, just to show you how much
I am afraid of you."
You must be shown that once for all.
"Did you have
tea?’ ‘No,’ I said, ‘and I don’t intend to.’ ‘Ha, ha!"
"you are playing
off your pride against your stomach!"
"That sort of heroism doesn’t sit
well on you,’ she said."
"“With that she did as she had said she would; she went to bed, and did
not lock her door."
In the morning she came out.
"‘Are you quite mad?’ she
said, sharply."
"‘Why, you’ll die of hunger like this.’ ‘Forgive me,’
I said."
"‘No, I won’t, and I won’t marry you."
I’ve said it.
"Surely you
haven’t sat in this chair all night without sleeping?’ ‘I didn’t
sleep,’ I said."
‘H’m!
how sensible of you.
"And are you going to have no
breakfast or dinner today?’ ‘I told you I wouldn’t."
"Forgive me!’ ‘You’ve
no idea how unbecoming this sort of thing is to you,’ she said, ‘it’s
like putting a saddle on a cow’s back."
"Do you think you are frightening
me?"
"My word, what a dreadful thing that you should sit here and eat no
food!"
"How terribly frightened I am!’ She wasn’t angry long, and didn’t
seem to remember my offence at all."
"I was surprised, for she is a
vindictive, resentful woman--but then I thought that perhaps she
despised me too much to feel any resentment against me."
"And that’s the
truth."
"“She came up to me and said, ‘Do you know who the Pope of Rome is?’
‘I’ve heard of him,’ I said."
"‘I suppose you’ve read the Universal
History, Parfen Semeonovitch, haven’t you?’ she asked."
"‘I’ve learned
nothing at all,’ I said."
‘Then I’ll lend it to you to read.
"You must
know there was a Roman Pope once, and he was very angry with a certain
Emperor; so the Emperor came and neither ate nor drank, but knelt before
the Pope’s palace till he should be forgiven."
"And what sort of vows do
you think that Emperor was making during all those days on his knees?"
"Stop, I’ll read it to you!’ Then she read me a lot of verses, where it
said that the Emperor spent all the time vowing vengeance against the
Pope."
"‘You don’t mean to say you don’t approve of the poem, Parfen
Semeonovitch,’ she says."
"‘All you have read out is perfectly true,’ say
I."
"‘Aha!’ says she, ‘you admit it’s true, do you?"
"And you are making
vows to yourself that if I marry you, you will remind me of all this,
and take it out of me.’ ‘I don’t know,’ I say, ‘perhaps I was thinking
like that, and perhaps I was not."
"I’m not thinking of anything just
now.’ ‘What are your thoughts, then?’ ‘I’m thinking that when you rise
from your chair and go past me, I watch you, and follow you with my
eyes; if your dress does but rustle, my heart sinks; if you leave the
room, I remember every little word and action, and what your voice
sounded like, and what you said."
"I thought of nothing all last night,
but sat here listening to your sleeping breath, and heard you move a
little, twice.’ ‘And as for your attack upon me,’ she says, ‘I suppose
you never once thought of _that?_’ ‘Perhaps I did think of it, and perhaps
not,’ I say."
"‘And what if I don’t either forgive you or marry, you?’
‘I tell you I shall go and drown myself.’ ‘H’m!’ she said, and then
relapsed into silence."
"Then she got angry, and went out."
"‘I suppose
you’d murder me before you drowned yourself, though!’ she cried as she
left the room."
"“An hour later, she came to me again, looking melancholy."
"‘I will marry
you, Parfen Semeonovitch,’ she says, not because I’m frightened of you,
but because it’s all the same to me how I ruin myself."
"And how can I do
it better?"
Sit down; they’ll bring you some dinner directly.
"And if I
do marry you, I’ll be a faithful wife to you--you need not doubt that.’
Then she thought a bit, and said, ‘At all events, you are not a flunkey;
at first, I thought you were no better than a flunkey.’ And she arranged
the wedding and fixed the day straight away on the spot."
"“Then, in another week, she had run away again, and came here to
Lebedeff’s; and when I found her here, she said to me, ‘I’m not going to
renounce you altogether, but I wish to put off the wedding a bit longer
yet--just as long as I like--for I am still my own mistress; so you may
wait, if you like.’ That’s how the matter stands between us now."
"What do
you think of all this, Lef Nicolaievitch?”

“‘What do you think of it yourself?” replied the prince, looking sadly
at Rogojin."
“As if I can think anything about it!
"I--” He was about to say more, but
stopped in despair."
"The prince rose again, as if he would leave."
"“At all events, I shall not interfere with you!” he murmured, as though
making answer to some secret thought of his own."
"“I’ll tell you what!” cried Rogojin, and his eyes flashed fire."
"“I can’t
understand your yielding her to me like this; I don’t understand it."
Have you given up loving her altogether?
"At first you suffered badly--I
know it--I saw it."
"Besides, why did you come post-haste after us?"
"Out of
pity, eh?"
"He, he, he!” His mouth curved in a mocking smile."
“Do you think I am deceiving you?” asked the prince.
“No!
I trust you--but I can’t understand.
"It seems to me that your pity
is greater than my love.” A hungry longing to speak his mind out seemed
to flash in the man’s eyes, combined with an intense anger."
"“Your love is mingled with hatred, and therefore, when your love passes,
there will be the greater misery,” said the prince."
"“I tell you this,
Parfen--”

“What!"
"that I’ll cut her throat, you mean?”

The prince shuddered."
"“You’ll hate her afterwards for all your present love, and for all the
torment you are suffering on her account now."
"What seems to me the most
extraordinary thing is, that she can again consent to marry you, after
all that has passed between you."
"When I heard the news yesterday, I
could hardly bring myself to believe it."
"Why, she has run twice
from you, from the very altar rails, as it were."
"She must have some
presentiment of evil."
What can she want with you now?
Your money?
Nonsense!
"Besides, I should think you must have made a fairly large hole
in your fortune already."
"Surely it is not because she is so very anxious
to find a husband?"
She could find many a one besides yourself.
"Anyone
would be better than you, because you will murder her, and I feel sure
she must know that but too well by now."
"Is it because you love her so
passionately?"
"Indeed, that may be it."
"I have heard that there are women
who want just that kind of love... but still...” The prince paused,
reflectively."
"“What are you grinning at my father’s portrait again for?” asked
Rogojin, suddenly."
"He was carefully observing every change in the
expression of the prince’s face."
"“I smiled because the idea came into my head that if it were not for
this unhappy passion of yours you might have, and would have, become
just such a man as your father, and that very quickly, too."
"You’d have
settled down in this house of yours with some silent and obedient wife."
"You would have spoken rarely, trusted no one, heeded no one, and thought
of nothing but making money.”

“Laugh away!"
"She said exactly the same, almost word for word, when she
saw my father’s portrait."
"It’s remarkable how entirely you and she are
at one now-a-days.”

“What, has she been here?” asked the prince with curiosity."
“Yes!
She looked long at the portrait and asked all about my father.
"‘You’d be just such another,’ she said at last, and laughed."
"‘You have
such strong passions, Parfen,’ she said, ‘that they’d have taken you to
Siberia in no time if you had not, luckily, intelligence as well."
"For
you have a good deal of intelligence.’ (She said this--believe it or
not."
The first time I ever heard anything of that sort from her.)
"‘You’d
soon have thrown up all this rowdyism that you indulge in now, and you’d
have settled down to quiet, steady money-making, because you have little
education; and here you’d have stayed just like your father before you."
"And you’d have loved your money so that you’d amass not two million,
like him, but ten million; and you’d have died of hunger on your money
bags to finish up with, for you carry everything to extremes.’ There,
that’s exactly word for word as she said it to me."
"She never talked to
me like that before."
"She always talks nonsense and laughs when she’s
with me."
We went all over this old house together.
"‘I shall change all
this,’ I said, ‘or else I’ll buy a new house for the wedding.’ ‘No, no!’
she said, ‘don’t touch anything; leave it all as it is; I shall live
with your mother when I marry you.’

“I took her to see my mother, and she was as respectful and kind as
though she were her own daughter."
"Mother has been almost demented ever
since father died--she’s an old woman."
"She sits and bows from her chair
to everyone she sees."
"If you left her alone and didn’t feed her for
three days, I don’t believe she would notice it."
"Well, I took her hand,
and I said, ‘Give your blessing to this lady, mother, she’s going to be
my wife.’ So Nastasia kissed mother’s hand with great feeling."
"‘She must
have suffered terribly, hasn’t she?’ she said."
"She saw this book here
lying before me."
‘What!
"have you begun to read Russian history?’ she
asked."
"She told me once in Moscow, you know, that I had better get
Solovieff’s Russian History and read it, because I knew nothing."
"‘That’s
good,’ she said, ‘you go on like that, reading books."
"I’ll make you
a list myself of the books you ought to read first--shall I?’ She had
never once spoken to me like this before; it was the first time I felt I
could breathe before her like a living creature.”

“I’m very, very glad to hear of this, Parfen,” said the prince, with
real feeling."
“Who knows?
"Maybe God will yet bring you near to one
another.”

“Never, never!” cried Rogojin, excitedly."
"“Look here, Parfen; if you love her so much, surely you must be anxious
to earn her respect?"
"And if you do so wish, surely you may hope to?"
"I
said just now that I considered it extraordinary that she could still be
ready to marry you."
"Well, though I cannot yet understand it, I feel sure
she must have some good reason, or she wouldn’t do it."
"She is sure
of your love; but besides that, she must attribute _something_ else to
you--some good qualities, otherwise the thing would not be."
"What you
have just said confirms my words."
"You say yourself that she found it
possible to speak to you quite differently from her usual manner."
"You
are suspicious, you know, and jealous, therefore when anything annoying
happens to you, you exaggerate its significance."
"Of course, of course,
she does not think so ill of you as you say."
"Why, if she did, she would
simply be walking to death by drowning or by the knife, with her eyes
wide open, when she married you."
It is impossible!
"As if anybody would
go to their death deliberately!”

Rogojin listened to the prince’s excited words with a bitter smile."
"His
conviction was, apparently, unalterable."
"“How dreadfully you look at me, Parfen!” said the prince, with a feeling
of dread."
"“Water or the knife?” said the latter, at last."
"“Ha, ha--that’s exactly
why she is going to marry me, because she knows for certain that the
knife awaits her."
"Prince, can it be that you don’t even yet see what’s
at the root of it all?”

“I don’t understand you.”

“Perhaps he really doesn’t understand me!"
"They do say that you are
a--you know what!"
"She loves another--there, you can understand that
much!"
"Just as I love her, exactly so she loves another man."
"And that
other man is--do you know who?"
It’s you.
"There--you didn’t know that,
eh?”

“I?”

“You, you!"
"She has loved you ever since that day, her birthday!"
"Only
she thinks she cannot marry you, because it would be the ruin of you."
"‘Everybody knows what sort of a woman I am,’ she says."
"She told me all
this herself, to my very face!"
"She’s afraid of disgracing and ruining
you, she says, but it doesn’t matter about me."
"She can marry me all
right!"
"Notice how much consideration she shows for me!”

“But why did she run away to me, and then again from me to--”

“From you to me?"
"Ha, ha!"
that’s nothing!
"Why, she always acts as though
she were in a delirium now-a-days!"
"Either she says, ‘Come on, I’ll marry
you!"
"Let’s have the wedding quickly!’ and fixes the day, and seems in a
hurry for it, and when it begins to come near she feels frightened; or
else some other idea gets into her head--goodness knows!"
"you’ve seen
her--you know how she goes on--laughing and crying and raving!"
"There’s
nothing extraordinary about her having run away from you!"
"She ran away
because she found out how dearly she loved you."
"She could not bear to be
near you."
"You said just now that I had found her at Moscow, when she ran
away from you."
"I didn’t do anything of the sort; she came to me herself,
straight from you."
‘Name the day--I’m ready!’ she said.
"‘Let’s have
some champagne, and go and hear the gipsies sing!’ I tell you she’d
have thrown herself into the water long ago if it were not for me!"
"She
doesn’t do it because I am, perhaps, even more dreadful to her than the
water!"
"She’s marrying me out of spite; if she marries me, I tell you, it
will be for spite!”

“But how do you, how can you--” began the prince, gazing with dread and
horror at Rogojin."
“Why don’t you finish your sentence?
"Shall I tell you what you were
thinking to yourself just then?"
"You were thinking, ‘How can she marry
him after this?"
"How can it possibly be permitted?’ Oh, I know what you
were thinking about!”

“I didn’t come here for that purpose, Parfen."
"That was not in my mind--”

“That may be!"
"Perhaps you didn’t _come_ with the idea, but the idea is
certainly there _now!_ Ha, ha!"
"well, that’s enough!"
"What are you upset
about?"
Didn’t you really know it all before?
"You astonish me!”

“All this is mere jealousy--it is some malady of yours, Parfen!"
"You
exaggerate everything,” said the prince, excessively agitated."
"“What are
you doing?”

“Let go of it!” said Parfen, seizing from the prince’s hand a knife
which the latter had at that moment taken up from the table, where it
lay beside the history."
Parfen replaced it where it had been.
"“I seemed to know it--I felt it, when I was coming back to Petersburg,”
 continued the prince, “I did not want to come, I wished to forget all
this, to uproot it from my memory altogether!"
"Well, good-bye--what is
the matter?”

He had absently taken up the knife a second time, and again Rogojin
snatched it from his hand, and threw it down on the table."
"It was a
plain looking knife, with a bone handle, a blade about eight inches long,
and broad in proportion, it did not clasp."
"Seeing that the prince was considerably struck by the fact that he had
twice seized this knife out of his hand, Rogojin caught it up with
some irritation, put it inside the book, and threw the latter across to
another table."
"“Do you cut your pages with it, or what?” asked Muishkin, still rather
absently, as though unable to throw off a deep preoccupation into which
the conversation had thrown him."
"“Yes.”

“It’s a garden knife, isn’t it?”

“Yes."
"Can’t one cut pages with a garden knife?”

“It’s quite new.”

“Well, what of that?"
"Can’t I buy a new knife if I like?” shouted Rogojin
furiously, his irritation growing with every word."
"The prince shuddered, and gazed fixedly at Parfen."
"Suddenly he burst out
laughing."
"“Why, what an idea!” he said."
"“I didn’t mean to ask you any of these
questions; I was thinking of something quite different!"
"But my head is
heavy, and I seem so absent-minded nowadays!"
"Well, good-bye--I can’t
remember what I wanted to say--good-bye!”

“Not that way,” said Rogojin."
"“There, I’ve forgotten that too!”

“This way--come along--I’ll show you.”

IV."
"They passed through the same rooms which the prince had traversed on his
arrival."
"In the largest there were pictures on the walls, portraits and
landscapes of little interest."
"Over the door, however, there was one of
strange and rather striking shape; it was six or seven feet in length,
and not more than a foot in height."
"It represented the Saviour just
taken from the cross."
"The prince glanced at it, but took no further notice."
"He moved on
hastily, as though anxious to get out of the house."
"But Rogojin suddenly
stopped underneath the picture."
"“My father picked up all these pictures very cheap at auctions, and so
on,” he said; “they are all rubbish, except the one over the door, and
that is valuable."
"A man offered five hundred roubles for it last week.”

“Yes--that’s a copy of a Holbein,” said the prince, looking at it again,
“and a good copy, too, so far as I am able to judge."
"I saw the picture
abroad, and could not forget it--what’s the matter?”

Rogojin had dropped the subject of the picture and walked on."
"Of course
his strange frame of mind was sufficient to account for his conduct;
but, still, it seemed queer to the prince that he should so abruptly
drop a conversation commenced by himself."
"Rogojin did not take any
notice of his question."
"“Lef Nicolaievitch,” said Rogojin, after a pause, during which the two
walked along a little further, “I have long wished to ask you, do you
believe in God?”

“How strangely you speak, and how odd you look!” said the other,
involuntarily."
"“I like looking at that picture,” muttered Rogojin, not noticing,
apparently, that the prince had not answered his question."
“That picture!
"That picture!” cried Muishkin, struck by a sudden idea."
"“Why, a man’s faith might be ruined by looking at that picture!”

“So it is!” said Rogojin, unexpectedly."
"They had now reached the front
door."
The prince stopped.
“How?” he said.
“What do you mean?
"I was half joking, and you took me up
quite seriously!"
"Why do you ask me whether I believe in God?”

“Oh, no particular reason."
"I meant to ask you before--many people are
unbelievers nowadays, especially Russians, I have been told."
"You ought
to know--you’ve lived abroad.”

Rogojin laughed bitterly as he said these words, and opening the door,
held it for the prince to pass out."
"Muishkin looked surprised, but went
out."
"The other followed him as far as the landing of the outer stairs,
and shut the door behind him."
"They both now stood facing one another, as
though oblivious of where they were, or what they had to do next."
"“Well, good-bye!” said the prince, holding out his hand."
"“Good-bye,” said Rogojin, pressing it hard, but quite mechanically."
"The prince made one step forward, and then turned round."
"“As to faith,” he said, smiling, and evidently unwilling to leave
Rogojin in this state--“as to faith, I had four curious conversations
in two days, a week or so ago."
"One morning I met a man in the train, and
made acquaintance with him at once."
"I had often heard of him as a very
learned man, but an atheist; and I was very glad of the opportunity of
conversing with so eminent and clever a person."
"He doesn’t believe in
God, and he talked a good deal about it, but all the while it appeared
to me that he was speaking _outside the subject_."
"And it has always struck
me, both in speaking to such men and in reading their books, that they
do not seem really to be touching on that at all, though on the surface
they may appear to do so."
"I told him this, but I dare say I did not
clearly express what I meant, for he could not understand me."
"“That same evening I stopped at a small provincial hotel, and it so
happened that a dreadful murder had been committed there the night
before, and everybody was talking about it."
"Two peasants--elderly men
and old friends--had had tea together there the night before, and were
to occupy the same bedroom."
"They were not drunk but one of them had
noticed for the first time that his friend possessed a silver watch
which he was wearing on a chain."
"He was by no means a thief, and was, as
peasants go, a rich man; but this watch so fascinated him that he could
not restrain himself."
"He took a knife, and when his friend turned his
back, he came up softly behind, raised his eyes to heaven, crossed
himself, and saying earnestly--‘God forgive me, for Christ’s sake!’ he
cut his friend’s throat like a sheep, and took the watch.”

Rogojin roared with laughter."
"He laughed as though he were in a sort of
fit."
"It was strange to see him laughing so after the sombre mood he had
been in just before."
"“Oh, I like that!"
"That beats anything!” he cried convulsively, panting
for breath."
"“One is an absolute unbeliever; the other is such a
thorough-going believer that he murders his friend to the tune of a
prayer!"
"Oh, prince, prince, that’s too good for anything!"
"You can’t have
invented it."
"It’s the best thing I’ve heard!”

“Next morning I went out for a stroll through the town,” continued the
prince, so soon as Rogojin was a little quieter, though his laughter
still burst out at intervals, “and soon observed a drunken-looking
soldier staggering about the pavement."
"He came up to me and said,
‘Buy my silver cross, sir!"
"You shall have it for fourpence--it’s real
silver.’ I looked, and there he held a cross, just taken off his own
neck, evidently, a large tin one, made after the Byzantine pattern."
"I
fished out fourpence, and put his cross on my own neck, and I could see
by his face that he was as pleased as he could be at the thought that he
had succeeded in cheating a foolish gentleman, and away he went to
drink the value of his cross."
"At that time everything that I saw made
a tremendous impression upon me."
"I had understood nothing about Russia
before, and had only vague and fantastic memories of it."
"So I thought,
‘I will wait awhile before I condemn this Judas."
"Only God knows what may
be hidden in the hearts of drunkards.’

“Well, I went homewards, and near the hotel I came across a poor woman,
carrying a child--a baby of some six weeks old."
"The mother was quite a
girl herself."
"The baby was smiling up at her, for the first time in its
life, just at that moment; and while I watched the woman she suddenly
crossed herself, oh, so devoutly!"
"‘What is it, my good woman?’ I asked
her."
(I was never but asking questions then!)
"‘Exactly as is a mother’s
joy when her baby smiles for the first time into her eyes, so is God’s
joy when one of His children turns and prays to Him for the first time,
with all his heart!’ This is what that poor woman said to me, almost
word for word; and such a deep, refined, truly religious thought it
was--a thought in which the whole essence of Christianity was expressed
in one flash--that is, the recognition of God as our Father, and of
God’s joy in men as His own children, which is the chief idea of Christ."
"She was a simple country-woman--a mother, it’s true--and perhaps, who
knows, she may have been the wife of the drunken soldier!"
"“Listen, Parfen; you put a question to me just now."
This is my reply.
"The essence of religious feeling has nothing to do with reason, or
atheism, or crime, or acts of any kind--it has nothing to do with these
things--and never had."
"There is something besides all this, something
which the arguments of the atheists can never touch."
"But the principal
thing, and the conclusion of my argument, is that this is most clearly
seen in the heart of a Russian."
"This is a conviction which I have gained
while I have been in this Russia of ours."
"Yes, Parfen!"
"there is work to
be done; there is work to be done in this Russian world!"
"Remember what
talks we used to have in Moscow!"
"And I never wished to come here at
all; and I never thought to meet you like this, Parfen!"
"Well,
well--good-bye--good-bye!"
"God be with you!”

He turned and went downstairs."
"“Lef Nicolaievitch!” cried Parfen, before he had reached the next
landing."
"“Have you got that cross you bought from the soldier with you?”

“Yes, I have,” and the prince stopped again."
"“Show it me, will you?”

A new fancy!"
"The prince reflected, and then mounted the stairs once
more."
He pulled out the cross without taking it off his neck.
"“Give it to me,” said Parfen."
“Why?
"do you--”

The prince would rather have kept this particular cross."
“I’ll wear it; and you shall have mine.
"I’ll take it off at once.”

“You wish to exchange crosses?"
"Very well, Parfen, if that’s the case,
I’m glad enough--that makes us brothers, you know.”

The prince took off his tin cross, Parfen his gold one, and the exchange
was made."
Parfen was silent.
"With sad surprise the prince observed that the look
of distrust, the bitter, ironical smile, had still not altogether left
his newly-adopted brother’s face."
"At moments, at all events, it showed
itself but too plainly,

At last Rogojin took the prince’s hand, and stood so for some moments,
as though he could not make up his mind."
"Then he drew him along,
murmuring almost inaudibly,

“Come!”

They stopped on the landing, and rang the bell at a door opposite to
Parfen’s own lodging."
"An old woman opened to them and bowed low to Parfen, who asked her some
questions hurriedly, but did not wait to hear her answer."
"He led the
prince on through several dark, cold-looking rooms, spotlessly clean,
with white covers over all the furniture."
"Without the ceremony of knocking, Parfen entered a small apartment,
furnished like a drawing-room, but with a polished mahogany partition
dividing one half of it from what was probably a bedroom."
"In one corner
of this room sat an old woman in an arm-chair, close to the stove."
"She
did not look very old, and her face was a pleasant, round one; but she
was white-haired and, as one could detect at the first glance, quite
in her second childhood."
"She wore a black woollen dress, with a black
handkerchief round her neck and shoulders, and a white cap with black
ribbons."
Her feet were raised on a footstool.
"Beside her sat another old
woman, also dressed in mourning, and silently knitting a stocking; this
was evidently a companion."
"They both looked as though they never broke
the silence."
"The first old woman, so soon as she saw Rogojin and the
prince, smiled and bowed courteously several times, in token of her
gratification at their visit."
"“Mother,” said Rogojin, kissing her hand, “here is my great friend,
Prince Muishkin; we have exchanged crosses; he was like a real brother
to me at Moscow at one time, and did a great deal for me."
"Bless him,
mother, as you would bless your own son."
"Wait a moment, let me arrange
your hands for you.”

But the old lady, before Parfen had time to touch her, raised her right
hand, and, with three fingers held up, devoutly made the sign of the
cross three times over the prince."
"She then nodded her head kindly at
him once more."
"“There, come along, Lef Nicolaievitch; that’s all I brought you here
for,” said Rogojin."
"When they reached the stairs again he added:

“She understood nothing of what I said to her, and did not know what I
wanted her to do, and yet she blessed you; that shows she wished to do
so herself."
"Well, goodbye; it’s time you went, and I must go too.”

He opened his own door."
"“Well, let me at least embrace you and say goodbye, you strange fellow!”
 cried the prince, looking with gentle reproach at Rogojin, and advancing
towards him."
"But the latter had hardly raised his arms when he dropped
them again."
"He could not make up his mind to it; he turned away from the
prince in order to avoid looking at him."
He could not embrace him.
"“Don’t be afraid,” he muttered, indistinctly, “though I have taken your
cross, I shall not murder you for your watch.” So saying, he laughed
suddenly, and strangely."
"Then in a moment his face became transfigured;
he grew deadly white, his lips trembled, his eyes burned like fire."
"He
stretched out his arms and held the prince tightly to him, and said in a
strangled voice:

“Well, take her!"
It’s Fate!
She’s yours.
I surrender her....
"Remember
Rogojin!” And pushing the prince from him, without looking back at him,
he hurriedly entered his own flat, and banged the door."
"V.

It was late now, nearly half-past two, and the prince did not find
General Epanchin at home."
"He left a card, and determined to look up
Colia, who had a room at a small hotel near."
"Colia was not in, but he
was informed that he might be back shortly, and had left word that if he
were not in by half-past three it was to be understood that he had gone
to Pavlofsk to General Epanchin’s, and would dine there."
"The prince
decided to wait till half-past three, and ordered some dinner."
"At
half-past three there was no sign of Colia."
"The prince waited until four
o’clock, and then strolled off mechanically wherever his feet should
carry him."
"In early summer there are often magnificent days in St.
Petersburg--bright, hot and still."
This happened to be such a day.
For some time the prince wandered about without aim or object.
"He did
not know the town well."
"He stopped to look about him on bridges, at
street corners."
"He entered a confectioner’s shop to rest, once."
"He was
in a state of nervous excitement and perturbation; he noticed nothing
and no one; and he felt a craving for solitude, to be alone with his
thoughts and his emotions, and to give himself up to them passively."
"He
loathed the idea of trying to answer the questions that would rise up
in his heart and mind."
"“I am not to blame for all this,” he thought to
himself, half unconsciously."
"Towards six o’clock he found himself at the station of the
Tsarsko-Selski railway."
"He was tired of solitude now; a new rush of feeling took hold of him,
and a flood of light chased away the gloom, for a moment, from his soul."
"He took a ticket to Pavlofsk, and determined to get there as fast as he
could, but something stopped him; a reality, and not a fantasy, as he
was inclined to think it."
"He was about to take his place in a carriage,
when he suddenly threw away his ticket and came out again, disturbed and
thoughtful."
"A few moments later, in the street, he recalled something
that had bothered him all the afternoon."
"He caught himself engaged in
a strange occupation which he now recollected he had taken up at odd
moments for the last few hours--it was looking about all around him for
something, he did not know what."
"He had forgotten it for a while, half
an hour or so, and now, suddenly, the uneasy search had recommenced."
"But he had hardly become conscious of this curious phenomenon, when
another recollection suddenly swam through his brain, interesting him
for the moment, exceedingly."
"He remembered that the last time he had
been engaged in looking around him for the unknown something, he was
standing before a cutler’s shop, in the window of which were exposed
certain goods for sale."
"He was extremely anxious now to discover whether
this shop and these goods really existed, or whether the whole thing had
been a hallucination."
"He felt in a very curious condition today, a condition similar to that
which had preceded his fits in bygone years."
"He remembered that at such times he had been particularly absentminded,
and could not discriminate between objects and persons unless he
concentrated special attention upon them."
He remembered seeing something in the window marked at sixty copecks.
"Therefore, if the shop existed and if this object were really in
the window, it would prove that he had been able to concentrate his
attention on this article at a moment when, as a general rule,
his absence of mind would have been too great to admit of any such
concentration; in fact, very shortly after he had left the railway
station in such a state of agitation."
"So he walked back looking about him for the shop, and his heart beat
with intolerable impatience."
Ah!
"here was the very shop, and there was
the article marked “60 cop.” Of course, it’s sixty copecks, he thought,
and certainly worth no more."
This idea amused him and he laughed.
But it was a hysterical laugh; he was feeling terribly oppressed.
"He
remembered clearly that just here, standing before this window, he had
suddenly turned round, just as earlier in the day he had turned and
found the dreadful eyes of Rogojin fixed upon him."
"Convinced, therefore,
that in this respect at all events he had been under no delusion, he
left the shop and went on."
"This must be thought out; it was clear that there had been no
hallucination at the station then, either; something had actually
happened to him, on both occasions; there was no doubt of it."
"But again
a loathing for all mental exertion overmastered him; he would not
think it out now, he would put it off and think of something else."
"He remembered that during his epileptic fits, or rather immediately
preceding them, he had always experienced a moment or two when his whole
heart, and mind, and body seemed to wake up to vigour and light; when
he became filled with joy and hope, and all his anxieties seemed to be
swept away for ever; these moments were but presentiments, as it were,
of the one final second (it was never more than a second) in which the
fit came upon him."
"That second, of course, was inexpressible."
"When his
attack was over, and the prince reflected on his symptoms, he used to
say to himself: “These moments, short as they are, when I feel such
extreme consciousness of myself, and consequently more of life than
at other times, are due only to the disease--to the sudden rupture of
normal conditions."
"Therefore they are not really a higher kind of life,
but a lower.” This reasoning, however, seemed to end in a paradox,
and lead to the further consideration:--“What matter though it be only
disease, an abnormal tension of the brain, if when I recall and analyze
the moment, it seems to have been one of harmony and beauty in the
highest degree--an instant of deepest sensation, overflowing with
unbounded joy and rapture, ecstatic devotion, and completest life?”
 Vague though this sounds, it was perfectly comprehensible to Muishkin,
though he knew that it was but a feeble expression of his sensations."
"That there was, indeed, beauty and harmony in those abnormal moments,
that they really contained the highest synthesis of life, he could not
doubt, nor even admit the possibility of doubt."
"He felt that they were
not analogous to the fantastic and unreal dreams due to intoxication
by hashish, opium or wine."
"Of that he could judge, when the attack was
over."
"These instants were characterized--to define it in a word--by
an intense quickening of the sense of personality."
"Since, in the last
conscious moment preceding the attack, he could say to himself, with
full understanding of his words: “I would give my whole life for this
one instant,” then doubtless to him it really was worth a lifetime."
"For the rest, he thought the dialectical part of his argument of little
worth; he saw only too clearly that the result of these ecstatic moments
was stupefaction, mental darkness, idiocy."
"No argument was possible
on that point."
"His conclusion, his estimate of the “moment,” doubtless
contained some error, yet the reality of the sensation troubled him."
What’s more unanswerable than a fact?
And this fact had occurred.
"The
prince had confessed unreservedly to himself that the feeling of intense
beatitude in that crowded moment made the moment worth a lifetime."
"“I
feel then,” he said one day to Rogojin in Moscow, “I feel then as if I
understood those amazing words--‘There shall be no more time.’” And he
added with a smile: “No doubt the epileptic Mahomet refers to that same
moment when he says that he visited all the dwellings of Allah, in less
time than was needed to empty his pitcher of water.” Yes, he had often
met Rogojin in Moscow, and many were the subjects they discussed."
"“He
told me I had been a brother to him,” thought the prince."
"“He said so
today, for the first time.”

He was sitting in the Summer Garden on a seat under a tree, and his
mind dwelt on the matter."
"It was about seven o’clock, and the place was
empty."
"The stifling atmosphere foretold a storm, and the prince felt a
certain charm in the contemplative mood which possessed him."
"He found
pleasure, too, in gazing at the exterior objects around him."
"All the
time he was trying to forget some thing, to escape from some idea that
haunted him; but melancholy thoughts came back, though he would so
willingly have escaped from them."
"He remembered suddenly how he had been
talking to the waiter, while he dined, about a recently committed murder
which the whole town was discussing, and as he thought of it something
strange came over him."
"He was seized all at once by a violent desire,
almost a temptation, against which he strove in vain."
"He jumped up and walked off as fast as he could towards the “Petersburg
Side.” [One of the quarters of St."
Petersburg.]
"He had asked someone, a
little while before, to show him which was the Petersburg Side, on the
banks of the Neva."
"He had not gone there, however; and he knew very
well that it was of no use to go now, for he would certainly not find
Lebedeff’s relation at home."
"He had the address, but she must certainly
have gone to Pavlofsk, or Colia would have let him know."
"If he were to
go now, it would merely be out of curiosity, but a sudden, new idea had
come into his head."
"However, it was something to move on and know where he was going."
"A
minute later he was still moving on, but without knowing anything."
"He
could no longer think out his new idea."
"He tried to take an interest in
all he saw; in the sky, in the Neva."
He spoke to some children he met.
He felt his epileptic condition becoming more and more developed.
"The
evening was very close; thunder was heard some way off."
"The prince was haunted all that day by the face of Lebedeff’s nephew
whom he had seen for the first time that morning, just as one is haunted
at times by some persistent musical refrain."
"By a curious association
of ideas, the young man always appeared as the murderer of whom Lebedeff
had spoken when introducing him to Muishkin."
"Yes, he had read something
about the murder, and that quite recently."
"Since he came to Russia, he
had heard many stories of this kind, and was interested in them."
"His
conversation with the waiter, an hour ago, chanced to be on the subject
of this murder of the Zemarins, and the latter had agreed with him about
it."
"He thought of the waiter again, and decided that he was no fool, but
a steady, intelligent man: though, said he to himself, “God knows
what he may really be; in a country with which one is unfamiliar it is
difficult to understand the people one meets.” He was beginning to have
a passionate faith in the Russian soul, however, and what discoveries he
had made in the last six months, what unexpected discoveries!"
"But every
soul is a mystery, and depths of mystery lie in the soul of a Russian."
"He had been intimate with Rogojin, for example, and a brotherly
friendship had sprung up between them--yet did he really know him?"
What chaos and ugliness fills the world at times!
"What a self-satisfied
rascal is that nephew of Lebedeff’s!"
"“But what am I thinking,” continued
the prince to himself."
“Can he really have committed that crime?
"Did he
kill those six persons?"
"I seem to be confusing things... how strange
it all is.... My head goes round... And Lebedeff’s daughter--how
sympathetic and charming her face was as she held the child in her arms!"
What an innocent look and child-like laugh she had!
"It is curious that I
had forgotten her until now."
"I expect Lebedeff adores her--and I really
believe, when I think of it, that as sure as two and two make four, he
is fond of that nephew, too!”

Well, why should he judge them so hastily!"
"Could he really say what they
were, after one short visit?"
Even Lebedeff seemed an enigma today.
Did he expect to find him so?
He had never seen him like that before.
Lebedeff and the Comtesse du Barry!
Good Heavens!
"If Rogojin should
really kill someone, it would not, at any rate, be such a senseless,
chaotic affair."
"A knife made to a special pattern, and six people killed
in a kind of delirium."
"But Rogojin also had a knife made to a special
pattern."
Can it be that Rogojin wishes to murder anyone?
"The prince
began to tremble violently."
"“It is a crime on my part to imagine
anything so base, with such cynical frankness.” His face reddened with
shame at the thought; and then there came across him as in a flash
the memory of the incidents at the Pavlofsk station, and at the other
station in the morning; and the question asked him by Rogojin about
_the eyes_ and Rogojin’s cross, that he was even now wearing; and the
benediction of Rogojin’s mother; and his embrace on the darkened
staircase--that last supreme renunciation--and now, to find himself full
of this new “idea,” staring into shop-windows, and looking round for
things--how base he was!"
"Despair overmastered his soul; he would not go on, he would go back to
his hotel; he even turned and went the other way; but a moment after he
changed his mind again and went on in the old direction."
"Why, here he was on the Petersburg Side already, quite close to the
house!"
Where was his “idea”?
He was marching along without it now.
"Yes,
his malady was coming back, it was clear enough; all this gloom and
heaviness, all these “ideas,” were nothing more nor less than a fit
coming on; perhaps he would have a fit this very day."
"But just now all the gloom and darkness had fled, his heart felt full of
joy and hope, there was no such thing as doubt."
"And yes, he hadn’t
seen her for so long; he really must see her."
"He wished he could meet
Rogojin; he would take his hand, and they would go to her together."
"His
heart was pure, he was no rival of Parfen’s."
"Tomorrow, he would go
and tell him that he had seen her."
"Why, he had only come for the sole
purpose of seeing her, all the way from Moscow!"
"Perhaps she might be
here still, who knows?"
She might not have gone away to Pavlofsk yet.
"Yes, all this must be put straight and above-board, there must be no
more passionate renouncements, such as Rogojin’s."
"It must all be clear
as day."
Cannot Rogojin’s soul bear the light?
"He said he did not love
her with sympathy and pity; true, he added that “your pity is greater
than my love,” but he was not quite fair on himself there."
Kin!
"Rogojin
reading a book--wasn’t that sympathy beginning?"
"Did it not show that he
comprehended his relations with her?"
"And his story of waiting day and
night for her forgiveness?"
That didn’t look quite like passion alone.
"And as to her face, could it inspire nothing but passion?"
"Could her
face inspire passion at all now?"
"Oh, it inspired suffering, grief,
overwhelming grief of the soul!"
"A poignant, agonizing memory swept over
the prince’s heart."
"Yes, agonizing."
"He remembered how he had suffered that first day when he
thought he observed in her the symptoms of madness."
"He had almost fallen
into despair."
"How could he have lost his hold upon her when she ran away
from him to Rogojin?"
"He ought to have run after her himself, rather than
wait for news as he had done."
"Can Rogojin have failed to observe, up
to now, that she is mad?"
"Rogojin attributes her strangeness to other
causes, to passion!"
What insane jealousy!
"What was it he had hinted at
in that suggestion of his?"
"The prince suddenly blushed, and shuddered to
his very heart."
But why recall all this?
There was insanity on both sides.
"For him, the
prince, to love this woman with passion, was unthinkable."
"It would be
cruel and inhuman."
Yes.
"Rogojin is not fair to himself; he has a large
heart; he has aptitude for sympathy."
"When he learns the truth, and finds
what a pitiable being is this injured, broken, half-insane creature, he
will forgive her all the torment she has caused him."
"He will become her
slave, her brother, her friend."
"Compassion will teach even Rogojin,
it will show him how to reason."
"Compassion is the chief law of human
existence."
"Oh, how guilty he felt towards Rogojin!"
"And, for a few warm,
hasty words spoken in Moscow, Parfen had called him “brother,” while
he--but no, this was delirium!"
It would all come right!
"That gloomy
Parfen had implied that his faith was waning; he must suffer dreadfully."
"He said he liked to look at that picture; it was not that he liked
it, but he felt the need of looking at it."
"Rogojin was not merely a
passionate soul; he was a fighter."
"He was fighting for the restoration
of his dying faith."
"He must have something to hold on to and believe,
and someone to believe in."
What a strange picture that of Holbein’s is!
"Why, this is the street, and here’s the house, No."
16.
"The prince rang the bell, and asked for Nastasia Philipovna."
"The lady of
the house came out, and stated that Nastasia had gone to stay with Daria
Alexeyevna at Pavlofsk, and might be there some days."
"Madame Filisoff was a little woman of forty, with a cunning face, and
crafty, piercing eyes."
"When, with an air of mystery, she asked her
visitor’s name, he refused at first to answer, but in a moment he
changed his mind, and left strict instructions that it should be given
to Nastasia Philipovna."
"The urgency of his request seemed to impress
Madame Filisoff, and she put on a knowing expression, as if to say, “You
need not be afraid, I quite understand.” The prince’s name evidently
was a great surprise to her."
"He stood and looked absently at her for a
moment, then turned, and took the road back to his hotel."
"But he went
away not as he came."
A great change had suddenly come over him.
"He went
blindly forward; his knees shook under him; he was tormented by “ideas”;
his lips were blue, and trembled with a feeble, meaningless smile."
"His
demon was upon him once more."
What had happened to him?
"Why was his brow clammy with drops of
moisture, his knees shaking beneath him, and his soul oppressed with a
cold gloom?"
Was it because he had just seen these dreadful eyes again?
"Why, he had left the Summer Garden on purpose to see them; that had been
his “idea.” He had wished to assure himself that he would see them once
more at that house."
"Then why was he so overwhelmed now, having seen them
as he expected?"
just as though he had not expected to see them!
"Yes,
they were the very same eyes; and no doubt about it."
"The same that he
had seen in the crowd that morning at the station, the same that he
had surprised in Rogojin’s rooms some hours later, when the latter had
replied to his inquiry with a sneering laugh, “Well, whose eyes were
they?” Then for the third time they had appeared just as he was getting
into the train on his way to see Aglaya."
"He had had a strong impulse to
rush up to Rogojin, and repeat his words of the morning “Whose eyes
are they?” Instead he had fled from the station, and knew nothing more,
until he found himself gazing into the window of a cutler’s shop, and
wondering if a knife with a staghorn handle would cost more than sixty
copecks."
"And as the prince sat dreaming in the Summer Garden under a
lime-tree, a wicked demon had come and whispered in his car: “Rogojin
has been spying upon you and watching you all the morning in a frenzy
of desperation."
"When he finds you have not gone to Pavlofsk--a terrible
discovery for him--he will surely go at once to that house in Petersburg
Side, and watch for you there, although only this morning you gave
your word of honour not to see _her_, and swore that you had not come to
Petersburg for that purpose.” And thereupon the prince had hastened off
to that house, and what was there in the fact that he had met Rogojin
there?"
"He had only seen a wretched, suffering creature, whose state of
mind was gloomy and miserable, but most comprehensible."
"In the morning
Rogojin had seemed to be trying to keep out of the way; but at the
station this afternoon he had stood out, he had concealed himself,
indeed, less than the prince himself; at the house, now, he had stood
fifty yards off on the other side of the road, with folded hands,
watching, plainly in view and apparently desirous of being seen."
"He had
stood there like an accuser, like a judge, not like a--a what?"
"And why had not the prince approached him and spoken to him, instead
of turning away and pretending he had seen nothing, although their eyes
met?"
"(Yes, their eyes had met, and they had looked at each other.)"
"Why,
he had himself wished to take Rogojin by the hand and go in together, he
had himself determined to go to him on the morrow and tell him that he
had seen her, he had repudiated the demon as he walked to the house, and
his heart had been full of joy."
"Was there something in the whole aspect of the man, today, sufficient
to justify the prince’s terror, and the awful suspicions of his demon?"
"Something seen, but indescribable, which filled him with dreadful
presentiments?"
"Yes, he was convinced of it--convinced of what?"
"(Oh, how
mean and hideous of him to feel this conviction, this presentiment!"
"How
he blamed himself for it!)"
"“Speak if you dare, and tell me, what is the
presentiment?” he repeated to himself, over and over again."
"“Put it into
words, speak out clearly and distinctly."
"Oh, miserable coward that I
am!” The prince flushed with shame for his own baseness."
"“How shall I
ever look this man in the face again?"
"My God, what a day!"
"And what a
nightmare, what a nightmare!”

There was a moment, during this long, wretched walk back from the
Petersburg Side, when the prince felt an irresistible desire to go
straight to Rogojin’s, wait for him, embrace him with tears of shame and
contrition, and tell him of his distrust, and finish with it--once for
all."
But here he was back at his hotel.
"How often during the day he had thought of this hotel with loathing--its
corridor, its rooms, its stairs."
"How he had dreaded coming back to it,
for some reason."
"“What a regular old woman I am today,” he had said to himself each time,
with annoyance."
"“I believe in every foolish presentiment that comes into
my head.”

He stopped for a moment at the door; a great flush of shame came over
him."
"“I am a coward, a wretched coward,” he said, and moved forward
again; but once more he paused."
"Among all the incidents of the day, one recurred to his mind to the
exclusion of the rest; although now that his self-control was regained,
and he was no longer under the influence of a nightmare, he was able
to think of it calmly."
It concerned the knife on Rogojin’s table.
"“Why
should not Rogojin have as many knives on his table as he chooses?”
 thought the prince, wondering at his suspicions, as he had done when he
found himself looking into the cutler’s window."
"“What could it have to
do with me?” he said to himself again, and stopped as if rooted to the
ground by a kind of paralysis of limb such as attacks people under the
stress of some humiliating recollection."
"The doorway was dark and gloomy at any time; but just at this moment
it was rendered doubly so by the fact that the thunder-storm had just
broken, and the rain was coming down in torrents."
"And in the semi-darkness the prince distinguished a man standing close
to the stairs, apparently waiting."
"There was nothing particularly significant in the fact that a man was
standing back in the doorway, waiting to come out or go upstairs; but
the prince felt an irresistible conviction that he knew this man, and
that it was Rogojin."
"The man moved on up the stairs; a moment later the
prince passed up them, too."
His heart froze within him.
"“In a minute or
two I shall know all,” he thought."
"The staircase led to the first and second corridors of the hotel, along
which lay the guests’ bedrooms."
"As is often the case in Petersburg
houses, it was narrow and very dark, and turned around a massive stone
column."
"On the first landing, which was as small as the necessary turn of the
stairs allowed, there was a niche in the column, about half a yard wide,
and in this niche the prince felt convinced that a man stood concealed."
He thought he could distinguish a figure standing there.
"He would pass
by quickly and not look."
"He took a step forward, but could bear the
uncertainty no longer and turned his head."
The eyes--the same two eyes--met his!
"The man concealed in the niche had
also taken a step forward."
For one second they stood face to face.
"Suddenly the prince caught the man by the shoulder and twisted him round
towards the light, so that he might see his face more clearly."
"Rogojin’s eyes flashed, and a smile of insanity distorted his
countenance."
"His right hand was raised, and something glittered in it."
The prince did not think of trying to stop it.
"All he could remember
afterwards was that he seemed to have called out:

“Parfen!"
"I won’t believe it.”

Next moment something appeared to burst open before him: a wonderful
inner light illuminated his soul."
"This lasted perhaps half a second, yet
he distinctly remembered hearing the beginning of the wail, the strange,
dreadful wail, which burst from his lips of its own accord, and which no
effort of will on his part could suppress."
"Next moment he was absolutely unconscious; black darkness blotted out
everything."
He had fallen in an epileptic fit.

As is well known, these fits occur instantaneously."
"The face, especially
the eyes, become terribly disfigured, convulsions seize the limbs, a
terrible cry breaks from the sufferer, a wail from which everything
human seems to be blotted out, so that it is impossible to believe that
the man who has just fallen is the same who emitted the dreadful cry."
"It seems more as though some other being, inside the stricken one,
had cried."
"Many people have borne witness to this impression; and many
cannot behold an epileptic fit without a feeling of mysterious terror
and dread."
"Such a feeling, we must suppose, overtook Rogojin at this moment, and
saved the prince’s life."
"Not knowing that it was a fit, and seeing
his victim disappear head foremost into the darkness, hearing his head
strike the stone steps below with a crash, Rogojin rushed downstairs,
skirting the body, and flung himself headlong out of the hotel, like a
raving madman."
"The prince’s body slipped convulsively down the steps till it rested at
the bottom."
"Very soon, in five minutes or so, he was discovered, and a
crowd collected around him."
A pool of blood on the steps near his head gave rise to grave fears.
"Was
it a case of accident, or had there been a crime?"
"It was, however, soon
recognized as a case of epilepsy, and identification and proper measures
for restoration followed one another, owing to a fortunate circumstance."
"Colia Ivolgin had come back to his hotel about seven o’clock, owing to
a sudden impulse which made him refuse to dine at the Epanchins’,
and, finding a note from the prince awaiting him, had sped away to the
latter’s address."
"Arrived there, he ordered a cup of tea and sat sipping
it in the coffee-room."
"While there he heard excited whispers of someone
just found at the bottom of the stairs in a fit; upon which he had
hurried to the spot, with a presentiment of evil, and at once recognized
the prince."
"The sufferer was immediately taken to his room, and though he partially
regained consciousness, he lay long in a semi-dazed condition."
"The doctor stated that there was no danger to be apprehended from the
wound on the head, and as soon as the prince could understand what
was going on around him, Colia hired a carriage and took him away
to Lebedeff’s."
"There he was received with much cordiality, and the
departure to the country was hastened on his account."
"Three days later
they were all at Pavlofsk."
VI.
"Lebedeff’s country-house was not large, but it was pretty and
convenient, especially the part which was let to the prince."
"A row of orange and lemon trees and jasmines, planted in green tubs,
stood on the fairly wide terrace."
"According to Lebedeff, these trees
gave the house a most delightful aspect."
"Some were there when he bought
it, and he was so charmed with the effect that he promptly added to
their number."
"When the tubs containing these plants arrived at the villa
and were set in their places, Lebedeff kept running into the street to
enjoy the view of the house, and every time he did so the rent to be
demanded from the future tenant went up with a bound."
"This country villa pleased the prince very much in his state of physical
and mental exhaustion."
"On the day that they left for Pavlofsk, that is
the day after his attack, he appeared almost well, though in reality he
felt very far from it."
"The faces of those around him for the last three
days had made a pleasant impression."
"He was pleased to see, not only
Colia, who had become his inseparable companion, but Lebedeff himself
and all the family, except the nephew, who had left the house."
"He was
also glad to receive a visit from General Ivolgin, before leaving St.
Petersburg."
"It was getting late when the party arrived at Pavlofsk, but several
people called to see the prince, and assembled in the verandah."
"Gania
was the first to arrive."
"He had grown so pale and thin that the prince
could hardly recognize him."
"Then came Varia and Ptitsin, who were
rusticating in the neighbourhood."
"As to General Ivolgin, he scarcely
budged from Lebedeff’s house, and seemed to have moved to Pavlofsk with
him."
"Lebedeff did his best to keep Ardalion Alexandrovitch by him, and
to prevent him from invading the prince’s quarters."
"He chatted with
him confidentially, so that they might have been taken for old friends."
"During those three days the prince had noticed that they frequently held
long conversations; he often heard their voices raised in argument on
deep and learned subjects, which evidently pleased Lebedeff."
"He seemed
as if he could not do without the general."
"But it was not only Ardalion
Alexandrovitch whom Lebedeff kept out of the prince’s way."
"Since they
had come to the villa, he treated his own family the same."
"Upon the
pretext that his tenant needed quiet, he kept him almost in isolation,
and Muishkin protested in vain against this excess of zeal."
"Lebedeff
stamped his feet at his daughters and drove them away if they attempted
to join the prince on the terrace; not even Vera was excepted."
"“They will lose all respect if they are allowed to be so free and easy;
besides it is not proper for them,” he declared at last, in answer to a
direct question from the prince."
“Why on earth not?” asked the latter.
"“Really, you know, you are making
yourself a nuisance, by keeping guard over me like this."
"I get bored
all by myself; I have told you so over and over again, and you get on
my nerves more than ever by waving your hands and creeping in and out in
the mysterious way you do.”

It was a fact that Lebedeff, though he was so anxious to keep everyone
else from disturbing the patient, was continually in and out of the
prince’s room himself."
"He invariably began by opening the door a crack
and peering in to see if the prince was there, or if he had escaped;
then he would creep softly up to the arm-chair, sometimes making
Muishkin jump by his sudden appearance."
"He always asked if the patient
wanted anything, and when the latter replied that he only wanted to be
left in peace, he would turn away obediently and make for the door on
tip-toe, with deprecatory gestures to imply that he had only just looked
in, that he would not speak a word, and would go away and not intrude
again; which did not prevent him from reappearing in ten minutes or
a quarter of an hour."
"Colia had free access to the prince, at which
Lebedeff was quite disgusted and indignant."
"He would listen at the door
for half an hour at a time while the two were talking."
"Colia found this
out, and naturally told the prince of his discovery."
"“Do you think yourself my master, that you try to keep me under lock and
key like this?” said the prince to Lebedeff."
"“In the country, at least,
I intend to be free, and you may make up your mind that I mean to see
whom I like, and go where I please.”

“Why, of course,” replied the clerk, gesticulating with his hands."
The prince looked him sternly up and down.
"“Well, Lukian Timofeyovitch, have you brought the little cupboard that
you had at the head of your bed with you here?”

“No, I left it where it was.”

“Impossible!”

“It cannot be moved; you would have to pull the wall down, it is so
firmly fixed.”

“Perhaps you have one like it here?”

“I have one that is even better, much better; that is really why I
bought this house.”

“Ah!"
"What visitor did you turn away from my door, about an hour ago?”

“The-the general."
"I would not let him in; there is no need for him to
visit you, prince..."
"I have the deepest esteem for him, he is a--a great
man."
You don’t believe it?
"Well, you will see, and yet, most excellent
prince, you had much better not receive him.”

“May I ask why?"
"and also why you walk about on tiptoe and always seem as
if you were going to whisper a secret in my ear whenever you come near
me?”

“I am vile, vile; I know it!” cried Lebedeff, beating his breast with a
contrite air."
"“But will not the general be too hospitable for you?”

“Too hospitable?”

“Yes."
"First, he proposes to come and live in my house."
"Well and good;
but he sticks at nothing; he immediately makes himself one of the
family."
"We have talked over our respective relations several times, and
discovered that we are connected by marriage."
"It seems also that you are
a sort of nephew on his mother’s side; he was explaining it to me again
only yesterday."
"If you are his nephew, it follows that I must also be a
relation of yours, most excellent prince."
"Never mind about that, it is
only a foible; but just now he assured me that all his life, from the
day he was made an ensign to the 11th of last June, he has entertained
at least two hundred guests at his table every day."
"Finally, he went so
far as to say that they never rose from the table; they dined, supped,
and had tea, for fifteen hours at a stretch."
"This went on for thirty
years without a break; there was barely time to change the table-cloth;
directly one person left, another took his place."
"On feast-days he
entertained as many as three hundred guests, and they numbered seven
hundred on the thousandth anniversary of the foundation of the Russian
Empire."
"It amounts to a passion with him; it makes one uneasy to hear of
it."
"It is terrible to have to entertain people who do things on such a
scale."
"That is why I wonder whether such a man is not too hospitable for
you and me.”

“But you seem to be on the best of terms with him?”

“Quite fraternal--I look upon it as a joke."
"Let us be brothers-in-law,
it is all the same to me,--rather an honour than not."
"But in spite of
the two hundred guests and the thousandth anniversary of the Russian
Empire, I can see that he is a very remarkable man."
I am quite sincere.
"You said just now that I always looked as if I was going to tell you a
secret; you are right."
"I have a secret to tell you: a certain person has
just let me know that she is very anxious for a secret interview with
you.”

“Why should it be secret?"
"Not at all; I will call on her myself
tomorrow.”

“No, oh no!” cried Lebedeff, waving his arms; “if she is afraid, it is
not for the reason you think."
"By the way, do you know that the monster
comes every day to inquire after your health?”

“You call him a monster so often that it makes me suspicious.”

“You must have no suspicions, none whatever,” said Lebedeff quickly."
"“I
only want you to know that the person in question is not afraid of him,
but of something quite, quite different.”

“What on earth is she afraid of, then?"
"Tell me plainly, without any more
beating about the bush,” said the prince, exasperated by the other’s
mysterious grimaces."
"“Ah that is the secret,” said Lebedeff, with a smile."
"“Whose secret?”

“Yours."
"You forbade me yourself to mention it before you, most excellent
prince,” murmured Lebedeff."
"Then, satisfied that he had worked up
Muishkin’s curiosity to the highest pitch, he added abruptly: “She is
afraid of Aglaya Ivanovna.”

The prince frowned for a moment in silence, and then said suddenly:

“Really, Lebedeff, I must leave your house."
"Where are Gavrila
Ardalionovitch and the Ptitsins?"
Are they here?
"Have you chased them
away, too?”

“They are coming, they are coming; and the general as well."
"I will open
all the doors; I will call all my daughters, all of them, this very
minute,” said Lebedeff in a low voice, thoroughly frightened, and waving
his hands as he ran from door to door."
"At that moment Colia appeared on the terrace; he announced that
Lizabetha Prokofievna and her three daughters were close behind him."
"Moved by this news, Lebedeff hurried up to the prince."
"“Shall I call the Ptitsins, and Gavrila Ardalionovitch?"
"Shall I let the
general in?” he asked."
“Why not?
Let in anyone who wants to see me.
"I assure you, Lebedeff, you
have misunderstood my position from the very first; you have been wrong
all along."
"I have not the slightest reason to hide myself from anyone,”
 replied the prince gaily."
"Seeing him laugh, Lebedeff thought fit to laugh also, and though much
agitated his satisfaction was quite visible."
Colia was right; the Epanchin ladies were only a few steps behind him.
"As they approached the terrace other visitors appeared from Lebedeff’s
side of the house--the Ptitsins, Gania, and Ardalion Alexandrovitch."
"The Epanchins had only just heard of the prince’s illness and of his
presence in Pavlofsk, from Colia; and up to this time had been in a
state of considerable bewilderment about him."
"The general brought the
prince’s card down from town, and Mrs. Epanchin had felt convinced that
he himself would follow his card at once; she was much excited."
"In vain the girls assured her that a man who had not written for six
months would not be in such a dreadful hurry, and that probably he had
enough to do in town without needing to bustle down to Pavlofsk to see
them."
"Their mother was quite angry at the very idea of such a thing, and
announced her absolute conviction that he would turn up the next day at
latest."
"So next day the prince was expected all the morning, and at dinner, tea,
and supper; and when he did not appear in the evening, Mrs. Epanchin
quarrelled with everyone in the house, finding plenty of pretexts
without so much as mentioning the prince’s name."
"On the third day there was no talk of him at all, until Aglaya remarked
at dinner: “Mamma is cross because the prince hasn’t turned up,” to
which the general replied that it was not his fault."
"Mrs. Epanchin misunderstood the observation, and rising from her place
she left the room in majestic wrath."
"In the evening, however, Colia came
with the story of the prince’s adventures, so far as he knew them."
"Mrs.
Epanchin was triumphant; although Colia had to listen to a long lecture."
"“He idles about here the whole day long, one can’t get rid of him; and
then when he is wanted he does not come."
"He might have sent a line if he
did not wish to inconvenience himself.”

At the words “one can’t get rid of him,” Colia was very angry, and
nearly flew into a rage; but he resolved to be quiet for the time and
show his resentment later."
"If the words had been less offensive he
might have forgiven them, so pleased was he to see Lizabetha Prokofievna
worried and anxious about the prince’s illness."
"She would have insisted on sending to Petersburg at once, for a certain
great medical celebrity; but her daughters dissuaded her, though they
were not willing to stay behind when she at once prepared to go and
visit the invalid."
"Aglaya, however, suggested that it was a little
unceremonious to go _en masse_ to see him."
"“Very well then, stay at home,” said Mrs. Epanchin, “and a good thing
too, for Evgenie Pavlovitch is coming down and there will be no one at
home to receive him.”

Of course, after this, Aglaya went with the rest."
"In fact, she had never
had the slightest intention of doing otherwise."
"Prince S., who was in the house, was requested to escort the ladies."
"He had been much interested when he first heard of the prince from the
Epanchins."
"It appeared that they had known one another before, and had
spent some time together in a little provincial town three months
ago."
"Prince S. had greatly taken to him, and was delighted with the
opportunity of meeting him again."
"The general had not come down from town as yet, nor had Evgenie
Pavlovitch arrived."
"It was not more than two or three hundred yards from the Epanchins’
house to Lebedeff’s."
"The first disagreeable impression experienced by
Mrs. Epanchin was to find the prince surrounded by a whole assembly of
other guests--not to mention the fact that some of those present were
particularly detestable in her eyes."
"The next annoying circumstance was
when an apparently strong and healthy young fellow, well dressed,
and smiling, came forward to meet her on the terrace, instead of the
half-dying unfortunate whom she had expected to see."
"She was astonished and vexed, and her disappointment pleased Colia
immensely."
"Of course he could have undeceived her before she started,
but the mischievous boy had been careful not to do that, foreseeing the
probably laughable disgust that she would experience when she found her
dear friend, the prince, in good health."
"Colia was indelicate enough to
voice the delight he felt at his success in managing to annoy Lizabetha
Prokofievna, with whom, in spite of their really amicable relations, he
was constantly sparring."
"“Just wait a while, my boy!” said she; “don’t be too certain of your
triumph.” And she sat down heavily, in the arm-chair pushed forward by
the prince."
"Lebedeff, Ptitsin, and General Ivolgin hastened to find chairs for
the young ladies."
"Varia greeted them joyfully, and they exchanged
confidences in ecstatic whispers."
"“I must admit, prince, I was a little put out to see you up and about
like this--I expected to find you in bed; but I give you my word, I was
only annoyed for an instant, before I collected my thoughts properly."
"I
am always wiser on second thoughts, and I dare say you are the same."
"I assure you I am as glad to see you well as though you were my own
son,--yes, and more; and if you don’t believe me the more shame to you,
and it’s not my fault."
"But that spiteful boy delights in playing all
sorts of tricks."
"You are his patron, it seems."
"Well, I warn you that
one fine morning I shall deprive myself of the pleasure of his further
acquaintance.”

“What have I done wrong now?” cried Colia."
"“What was the good of telling
you that the prince was nearly well again?"
"You would not have believed
me; it was so much more interesting to picture him on his death-bed.”

“How long do you remain here, prince?” asked Madame Epanchin."
"“All the summer, and perhaps longer.”

“You are alone, aren’t you,--not married?”

“No, I’m not married!” replied the prince, smiling at the ingenuousness
of this little feeler."
"“Oh, you needn’t laugh!"
"These things do happen, you know!"
"Now then--why
didn’t you come to us?"
We have a wing quite empty.
"But just as you like,
of course."
"Do you lease it from _him?_--this fellow, I mean,” she added,
nodding towards Lebedeff."
"“And why does he always wriggle so?”

At that moment Vera, carrying the baby in her arms as usual, came out of
the house, on to the terrace."
"Lebedeff kept fidgeting among the chairs,
and did not seem to know what to do with himself, though he had no
intention of going away."
"He no sooner caught sight of his daughter, than
he rushed in her direction, waving his arms to keep her away; he even
forgot himself so far as to stamp his foot."
“Is he mad?” asked Madame Epanchin suddenly.
"“No, he...”

“Perhaps he is drunk?"
"Your company is rather peculiar,” she added, with
a glance at the other guests....

“But what a pretty girl!"
"Who is she?”

“That is Lebedeff’s daughter--Vera Lukianovna.”

“Indeed?"
She looks very sweet.
"I should like to make her acquaintance.”

The words were hardly out of her mouth, when Lebedeff dragged Vera
forward, in order to present her."
"“Orphans, poor orphans!” he began in a pathetic voice."
"“The child she carries is an orphan, too."
"She is Vera’s sister, my
daughter Luboff."
"The day this babe was born, six weeks ago, my wife
died, by the will of God Almighty...."
"Yes... Vera takes her mother’s
place, though she is but her sister... nothing more... nothing more...”

“And you!"
"You are nothing more than a fool, if you’ll excuse me!"
Well!
well!
"you know that yourself, I expect,” said the lady indignantly."
Lebedeff bowed low.
"“It is the truth,” he replied, with extreme respect."
"“Oh, Mr. Lebedeff, I am told you lecture on the Apocalypse."
"Is it true?”
 asked Aglaya."
"“Yes, that is so... for the last fifteen years.”

“I have heard of you, and I think read of you in the newspapers.”

“No, that was another commentator, whom the papers named."
"He is dead,
however, and I have taken his place,” said the other, much delighted."
"“We are neighbours, so will you be so kind as to come over one day and
explain the Apocalypse to me?” said Aglaya."
"“I do not understand it in
the least.”

“Allow me to warn you,” interposed General Ivolgin, “that he is the
greatest charlatan on earth.” He had taken the chair next to the girl,
and was impatient to begin talking."
"“No doubt there are pleasures and
amusements peculiar to the country,” he continued, “and to listen to a
pretended student holding forth on the book of the Revelations may be
as good as any other."
It may even be original.
"But... you seem to
be looking at me with some surprise--may I introduce myself--General
Ivolgin--I carried you in my arms as a baby--”

“Delighted, I’m sure,” said Aglaya; “I am acquainted with Varvara
Ardalionovna and Nina Alexandrovna.” She was trying hard to restrain
herself from laughing."
"Mrs. Epanchin flushed up; some accumulation of spleen in her suddenly
needed an outlet."
"She could not bear this General Ivolgin whom she had
once known, long ago--in society."
"“You are deviating from the truth, sir, as usual!” she remarked, boiling
over with indignation; “you never carried her in your life!”

“You have forgotten, mother,” said Aglaya, suddenly."
"“He really did
carry me about,--in Tver, you know."
"I was six years old, I remember."
"He made me a bow and arrow, and I shot a pigeon."
"Don’t you remember
shooting a pigeon, you and I, one day?”

“Yes, and he made me a cardboard helmet, and a little wooden sword--I
remember!” said Adelaida."
"“Yes, I remember too!” said Alexandra."
"“You quarrelled about the wounded
pigeon, and Adelaida was put in the corner, and stood there with her
helmet and sword and all.”

The poor general had merely made the remark about having carried Aglaya
in his arms because he always did so begin a conversation with young
people."
"But it happened that this time he had really hit upon the truth,
though he had himself entirely forgotten the fact."
"But when Adelaida and
Aglaya recalled the episode of the pigeon, his mind became filled
with memories, and it is impossible to describe how this poor old man,
usually half drunk, was moved by the recollection."
“I remember--I remember it all!” he cried.
“I was captain then.
"You were
such a lovely little thing--Nina Alexandrovna!--Gania, listen!"
"I was
received then by General Epanchin.”

“Yes, and look what you have come to now!” interrupted Mrs. Epanchin."
"“However, I see you have not quite drunk your better feelings away."
"But
you’ve broken your wife’s heart, sir--and instead of looking after
your children, you have spent your time in public-houses and debtors’
prisons!"
"Go away, my friend, stand in some corner and weep, and bemoan
your fallen dignity, and perhaps God will forgive you yet!"
"Go, go!"
"I’m
serious!"
"There’s nothing so favourable for repentance as to think of the
past with feelings of remorse!”

There was no need to repeat that she was serious."
"The general, like all
drunkards, was extremely emotional and easily touched by recollections
of his better days."
"He rose and walked quietly to the door, so meekly
that Mrs. Epanchin was instantly sorry for him."
"“Ardalion Alexandrovitch,” she cried after him, “wait a moment, we are
all sinners!"
"When you feel that your conscience reproaches you a little
less, come over to me and we’ll have a talk about the past!"
"I dare say I
am fifty times more of a sinner than you are!"
"And now go, go, good-bye,
you had better not stay here!” she added, in alarm, as he turned as
though to come back."
"“Don’t go after him just now, Colia, or he’ll be vexed, and the benefit
of this moment will be lost!” said the prince, as the boy was hurrying
out of the room."
“Quite true!
"Much better to go in half an hour or so,” said Mrs. Epanchin."
"“That’s what comes of telling the truth for once in one’s life!” said
Lebedeff."
"“It reduced him to tears.”

“Come, come!"
"the less _you_ say about it the better--to judge from all I
have heard about you!” replied Mrs. Epanchin."
"The prince took the first opportunity of informing the Epanchin ladies
that he had intended to pay them a visit that day, if they had not
themselves come this afternoon, and Lizabetha Prokofievna replied that
she hoped he would still do so."
By this time some of the visitors had disappeared.
"Ptitsin had tactfully retreated to Lebedeff’s wing; and Gania soon
followed him."
"The latter had behaved modestly, but with dignity, on this occasion
of his first meeting with the Epanchins since the rupture."
"Twice Mrs.
Epanchin had deliberately examined him from head to foot; but he had
stood fire without flinching."
"He was certainly much changed, as anyone
could see who had not met him for some time; and this fact seemed to
afford Aglaya a good deal of satisfaction."
"“That was Gavrila Ardalionovitch, who just went out, wasn’t it?” she
asked suddenly, interrupting somebody else’s conversation to make the
remark."
"“Yes, it was,” said the prince."
"“I hardly knew him; he is much changed, and for the better!”

“I am very glad,” said the prince."
"“He has been very ill,” added Varia."
“How has he changed for the better?” asked Mrs. Epanchin.
"“I don’t see
any change for the better!"
What’s better in him?
"Where did you get _that_
idea from?"
"_What’s_ better?”

“There’s nothing better than the ‘poor knight’!” said Colia, who was
standing near the last speaker’s chair."
"“I quite agree with you there!” said Prince S., laughing."
"“So do I,” said Adelaida, solemnly."
"“_What_ poor knight?” asked Mrs. Epanchin, looking round at the face of
each of the speakers in turn."
"Seeing, however, that Aglaya was blushing,
she added, angrily:

“What nonsense you are all talking!"
"What do you mean by poor knight?”

“It’s not the first time this urchin, your favourite, has shown his
impudence by twisting other people’s words,” said Aglaya, haughtily."
"Every time that Aglaya showed temper (and this was very often), there
was so much childish pouting, such “school-girlishness,” as it were, in
her apparent wrath, that it was impossible to avoid smiling at her, to
her own unutterable indignation."
"On these occasions she would say, “How
can they, how _dare_ they laugh at me?”

This time everyone laughed at her, her sisters, Prince S., Prince
Muishkin (though he himself had flushed for some reason), and Colia."
"Aglaya was dreadfully indignant, and looked twice as pretty in her
wrath."
"“He’s always twisting round what one says,” she cried."
“I am only repeating your own exclamation!” said Colia.
"“A month ago you
were turning over the pages of your Don Quixote, and suddenly called out
‘there is nothing better than the poor knight.’ I don’t know whom
you were referring to, of course, whether to Don Quixote, or Evgenie
Pavlovitch, or someone else, but you certainly said these words, and
afterwards there was a long conversation...”

“You are inclined to go a little too far, my good boy, with your
guesses,” said Mrs. Epanchin, with some show of annoyance."
"“But it’s not I alone,” cried Colia."
"“They all talked about it, and they
do still."
"Why, just now Prince S. and Adelaida Ivanovna declared that
they upheld ‘the poor knight’; so evidently there does exist a ‘poor
knight’; and if it were not for Adelaida Ivanovna, we should have known
long ago who the ‘poor knight’ was.”

“Why, how am I to blame?” asked Adelaida, smiling."
"“You wouldn’t draw his portrait for us, that’s why you are to blame!"
"Aglaya Ivanovna asked you to draw his portrait, and gave you the whole
subject of the picture."
"She invented it herself; and you wouldn’t.”

“What was I to draw?"
"According to the lines she quoted:

  “‘From his face he never lifted
    That eternal mask of steel.’”

“What sort of a face was I to draw?"
"I couldn’t draw a mask.”

“I don’t know what you are driving at; what mask do you mean?” said
Mrs. Epanchin, irritably."
"She began to see pretty clearly though what
it meant, and whom they referred to by the generally accepted title of
“poor knight.” But what specially annoyed her was that the prince was
looking so uncomfortable, and blushing like a ten-year-old child."
"“Well, have you finished your silly joke?” she added, “and am I to be
told what this ‘poor knight’ means, or is it a solemn secret which
cannot be approached lightly?”

But they all laughed on."
"“It’s simply that there is a Russian poem,” began Prince S., evidently
anxious to change the conversation, “a strange thing, without beginning
or end, and all about a ‘poor knight.’ A month or so ago, we were all
talking and laughing, and looking up a subject for one of Adelaida’s
pictures--you know it is the principal business of this family to find
subjects for Adelaida’s pictures."
"Well, we happened upon this ‘poor
knight.’ I don’t remember who thought of it first--”

“Oh!"
"Aglaya Ivanovna did,” said Colia."
"“Very likely--I don’t recollect,” continued Prince S.

“Some of us laughed at the subject; some liked it; but she declared
that, in order to make a picture of the gentleman, she must first see
his face."
"We then began to think over all our friends’ faces to see
if any of them would do, and none suited us, and so the matter stood;
that’s all."
"I don’t know why Nicolai Ardalionovitch has brought up
the joke now."
"What was appropriate and funny then, has quite lost all
interest by this time.”

“Probably there’s some new silliness about it,” said Mrs. Epanchin,
sarcastically."
"“There is no silliness about it at all--only the profoundest respect,”
 said Aglaya, very seriously."
"She had quite recovered her temper; in
fact, from certain signs, it was fair to conclude that she was delighted
to see this joke going so far; and a careful observer might have
remarked that her satisfaction dated from the moment when the fact of
the prince’s confusion became apparent to all."
“‘Profoundest respect!’ What nonsense!
"First, insane giggling, and then,
all of a sudden, a display of ‘profoundest respect.’ Why respect?"
"Tell
me at once, why have you suddenly developed this ‘profound respect,’
eh?”

“Because,” replied Aglaya gravely, “in the poem the knight is described
as a man capable of living up to an ideal all his life."
"That sort of
thing is not to be found every day among the men of our times."
"In the
poem it is not stated exactly what the ideal was, but it was evidently
some vision, some revelation of pure Beauty, and the knight wore round
his neck, instead of a scarf, a rosary."
A device--A. N.
"B.--the meaning
of which is not explained, was inscribed on his shield--”

“No, A. N. D.,” corrected Colia."
"“I say A. N. B., and so it shall be!” cried Aglaya, irritably."
"“Anyway,
the ‘poor knight’ did not care what his lady was, or what she did."
"He
had chosen his ideal, and he was bound to serve her, and break lances
for her, and acknowledge her as the ideal of pure Beauty, whatever she
might say or do afterwards."
"If she had taken to stealing, he would have
championed her just the same."
"I think the poet desired to embody in this
one picture the whole spirit of medieval chivalry and the platonic love
of a pure and high-souled knight."
"Of course it’s all an ideal, and in
the ‘poor knight’ that spirit reached the utmost limit of asceticism."
"He
is a Don Quixote, only serious and not comical."
"I used not to understand
him, and laughed at him, but now I love the ‘poor knight,’ and respect
his actions.”

So ended Aglaya; and, to look at her, it was difficult, indeed, to judge
whether she was joking or in earnest."
“Pooh!
"he was a fool, and his actions were the actions of a fool,” said
Mrs. Epanchin; “and as for you, young woman, you ought to know better."
"At all events, you are not to talk like that again."
What poem is it?
Recite it!
I want to hear this poem!
I have hated poetry all my life.
"Prince, you must excuse this nonsense."
"We neither of us like this sort
of thing!"
"Be patient!”

They certainly were put out, both of them."
"The prince tried to say something, but he was too confused, and could
not get his words out."
"Aglaya, who had taken such liberties in her
little speech, was the only person present, perhaps, who was not in the
least embarrassed."
"She seemed, in fact, quite pleased."
"She now rose solemnly from her seat, walked to the centre of the
terrace, and stood in front of the prince’s chair."
"All looked on with
some surprise, and Prince S. and her sisters with feelings of decided
alarm, to see what new frolic she was up to; it had gone quite far
enough already, they thought."
"But Aglaya evidently thoroughly enjoyed
the affectation and ceremony with which she was introducing her
recitation of the poem."
"Mrs. Epanchin was just wondering whether she would not forbid the
performance after all, when, at the very moment that Aglaya commenced
her declamation, two new guests, both talking loudly, entered from the
street."
The new arrivals were General Epanchin and a young man.
Their entrance caused some slight commotion.
VII.
"The young fellow accompanying the general was about twenty-eight, tall,
and well built, with a handsome and clever face, and bright black eyes,
full of fun and intelligence."
"Aglaya did not so much as glance at the new arrivals, but went on with
her recitation, gazing at the prince the while in an affected manner,
and at him alone."
"It was clear to him that she was doing all this with
some special object."
"But the new guests at least somewhat eased his strained and
uncomfortable position."
"Seeing them approaching, he rose from his chair,
and nodding amicably to the general, signed to him not to interrupt the
recitation."
"He then got behind his chair, and stood there with his left
hand resting on the back of it."
"Thanks to this change of position,
he was able to listen to the ballad with far less embarrassment than
before."
"Mrs. Epanchin had also twice motioned to the new arrivals to be
quiet, and stay where they were."
The prince was much interested in the young man who had just entered.
"He
easily concluded that this was Evgenie Pavlovitch Radomski, of whom he
had already heard mention several times."
"He was puzzled, however, by the
young man’s plain clothes, for he had always heard of Evgenie Pavlovitch
as a military man."
"An ironical smile played on Evgenie’s lips all the
while the recitation was proceeding, which showed that he, too, was
probably in the secret of the ‘poor knight’ joke."
"But it had become
quite a different matter with Aglaya."
"All the affectation of manner
which she had displayed at the beginning disappeared as the ballad
proceeded."
"She spoke the lines in so serious and exalted a manner, and
with so much taste, that she even seemed to justify the exaggerated
solemnity with which she had stepped forward."
"It was impossible to
discern in her now anything but a deep feeling for the spirit of the
poem which she had undertaken to interpret."
"Her eyes were aglow with inspiration, and a slight tremor of rapture
passed over her lovely features once or twice."
"She continued to recite:

  “Once there came a vision glorious,
   Mystic, dreadful, wondrous fair;
   Burned itself into his spirit,
   And abode for ever there!"
"“Never more--from that sweet moment--
   Gazéd he on womankind;
   He was dumb to love and wooing
   And to all their graces blind."
"“Full of love for that sweet vision,
   Brave and pure he took the field;
   With his blood he stained the letters
   N. P. B. upon his shield."
"“‘Lumen caeli, sancta Rosa!’
   Shouting on the foe he fell,
   And like thunder rang his war-cry
   O’er the cowering infidel."
"“Then within his distant castle,
   Home returned, he dreamed his days--
   Silent, sad,--and when death took him
   He was mad, the legend says.”

When recalling all this afterwards the prince could not for the life of
him understand how to reconcile the beautiful, sincere, pure nature of
the girl with the irony of this jest."
"That it was a jest there was no
doubt whatever; he knew that well enough, and had good reason, too,
for his conviction; for during her recitation of the ballad Aglaya had
deliberately changed the letters A. N. B. into N. P. B."
"He was quite
sure she had not done this by accident, and that his ears had not
deceived him."
"At all events her performance--which was a joke, of
course, if rather a crude one,--was premeditated."
"They had evidently
talked (and laughed) over the ‘poor knight’ for more than a month."
"Yet Aglaya had brought out these letters N. P. B. not only without the
slightest appearance of irony, or even any particular accentuation, but
with so even and unbroken an appearance of seriousness that assuredly
anyone might have supposed that these initials were the original ones
written in the ballad."
"The thing made an uncomfortable impression upon
the prince."
"Of course Mrs. Epanchin saw nothing either in the change of
initials or in the insinuation embodied therein."
"General Epanchin only
knew that there was a recitation of verses going on, and took no further
interest in the matter."
"Of the rest of the audience, many had understood
the allusion and wondered both at the daring of the lady and at the
motive underlying it, but tried to show no sign of their feelings."
"But
Evgenie Pavlovitch (as the prince was ready to wager) both comprehended
and tried his best to show that he comprehended; his smile was too
mocking to leave any doubt on that point."
"“How beautiful that is!” cried Mrs. Epanchin, with sincere admiration."
"“Whose is it?”

“Pushkin’s, mama, of course!"
"Don’t disgrace us all by showing your
ignorance,” said Adelaida."
"“As soon as we reach home give it to me to read.”

“I don’t think we have a copy of Pushkin in the house.”

“There are a couple of torn volumes somewhere; they have been lying
about from time immemorial,” added Alexandra."
"“Send Feodor or Alexey up by the very first train to buy a copy,
then.--Aglaya, come here--kiss me, dear, you recited beautifully!"
"but,”
 she added in a whisper, “if you were sincere I am sorry for you."
"If it
was a joke, I do not approve of the feelings which prompted you to do
it, and in any case you would have done far better not to recite it at
all."
"Do you understand?--Now come along, young woman; we’ve sat here too
long."
"I’ll speak to you about this another time.”

Meanwhile the prince took the opportunity of greeting General Epanchin,
and the general introduced Evgenie Pavlovitch to him."
"“I caught him up on the way to your house,” explained the general."
"“He
had heard that we were all here.”

“Yes, and I heard that you were here, too,” added Evgenie Pavlovitch;
“and since I had long promised myself the pleasure of seeking not only
your acquaintance but your friendship, I did not wish to waste time, but
came straight on."
"I am sorry to hear that you are unwell.”

“Oh, but I’m quite well now, thank you, and very glad to make your
acquaintance."
"Prince S. has often spoken to me about you,” said
Muishkin, and for an instant the two men looked intently into one
another’s eyes."
"The prince remarked that Evgenie Pavlovitch’s plain clothes had
evidently made a great impression upon the company present, so much so
that all other interests seemed to be effaced before this surprising
fact."
His change of dress was evidently a matter of some importance.
"Adelaida
and Alexandra poured out a stream of questions; Prince S., a relative
of the young man, appeared annoyed; and Ivan Fedorovitch quite excited."
Aglaya alone was not interested.
"She merely looked closely at Evgenie
for a minute, curious perhaps as to whether civil or military clothes
became him best, then turned away and paid no more attention to him or
his costume."
"Lizabetha Prokofievna asked no questions, but it was clear
that she was uneasy, and the prince fancied that Evgenie was not in her
good graces."
"“He has astonished me,” said Ivan Fedorovitch."
"“I nearly fell down with
surprise."
"I could hardly believe my eyes when I met him in Petersburg
just now."
Why this haste?
That’s what I want to know.
"He has always said
himself that there is no need to break windows.”

Evgenie Pavlovitch remarked here that he had spoken of his intention of
leaving the service long ago."
"He had, however, always made more or less
of a joke about it, so no one had taken him seriously."
"For that matter
he joked about everything, and his friends never knew what to believe,
especially if he did not wish them to understand him."
"“I have only retired for a time,” said he, laughing."
"“For a few months;
at most for a year.”

“But there is no necessity for you to retire at all,” complained the
general, “as far as I know.”

“I want to go and look after my country estates."
"You advised me to do
that yourself,” was the reply."
"“And then I wish to go abroad.”

After a few more expostulations, the conversation drifted into other
channels, but the prince, who had been an attentive listener, thought
all this excitement about so small a matter very curious."
"“There must be
more in it than appears,” he said to himself."
"“I see the ‘poor knight’ has come on the scene again,” said Evgenie
Pavlovitch, stepping to Aglaya’s side."
"To the amazement of the prince, who overheard the remark, Aglaya looked
haughtily and inquiringly at the questioner, as though she would give
him to know, once for all, that there could be no talk between them
about the ‘poor knight,’ and that she did not understand his question."
“But not now!
It is too late to send to town for a Pushkin now.
"It is
much too late, I say!” Colia was exclaiming in a loud voice."
"“I have
told you so at least a hundred times.”

“Yes, it is really much too late to send to town now,” said Evgenie
Pavlovitch, who had escaped from Aglaya as rapidly as possible."
"“I am
sure the shops are shut in Petersburg; it is past eight o’clock,” he
added, looking at his watch."
"“We have done without him so far,” interrupted Adelaida in her turn."
"“Surely we can wait until to-morrow.”

“Besides,” said Colia, “it is quite unusual, almost improper, for
people in our position to take any interest in literature."
"Ask Evgenie
Pavlovitch if I am not right."
"It is much more fashionable to drive a
waggonette with red wheels.”

“You got that from some magazine, Colia,” remarked Adelaida."
"“He gets most of his conversation in that way,” laughed Evgenie
Pavlovitch."
“He borrows whole phrases from the reviews.
"I have long
had the pleasure of knowing both Nicholai Ardalionovitch and his
conversational methods, but this time he was not repeating something he
had read; he was alluding, no doubt, to my yellow waggonette, which has,
or had, red wheels."
"But I have exchanged it, so you are rather behind
the times, Colia.”

The prince had been listening attentively to Radomski’s words, and
thought his manner very pleasant."
"When Colia chaffed him about his
waggonette he had replied with perfect equality and in a friendly
fashion."
This pleased Muishkin.
"At this moment Vera came up to Lizabetha Prokofievna, carrying several
large and beautifully bound books, apparently quite new."
“What is it?” demanded the lady.
"“This is Pushkin,” replied the girl."
"“Papa told me to offer it to you.”

“What?"
Impossible!” exclaimed Mrs. Epanchin.
"“Not as a present, not as a present!"
"I should not have taken the
liberty,” said Lebedeff, appearing suddenly from behind his daughter."
"“It is our own Pushkin, our family copy, Annenkoff’s edition; it could
not be bought now."
"I beg to suggest, with great respect, that your
excellency should buy it, and thus quench the noble literary thirst
which is consuming you at this moment,” he concluded grandiloquently."
“Oh!
"if you will sell it, very good--and thank you."
"You shall not be a
loser!"
"But for goodness’ sake, don’t twist about like that, sir!"
"I have
heard of you; they tell me you are a very learned person."
"We must have a
talk one of these days."
"You will bring me the books yourself?”

“With the greatest respect... and... and veneration,” replied Lebedeff,
making extraordinary grimaces."
"“Well, bring them, with or without respect, provided always you do not
drop them on the way; but on the condition,” went on the lady, looking
full at him, “that you do not cross my threshold."
"I do not intend to
receive you today."
"You may send your daughter Vera at once, if you like."
"I am much pleased with her.”

“Why don’t you tell him about them?” said Vera impatiently to her
father."
"“They will come in, whether you announce them or not, and they
are beginning to make a row."
"Lef Nicolaievitch,”--she addressed herself
to the prince--“four men are here asking for you."
"They have waited some
time, and are beginning to make a fuss, and papa will not bring them
in.”

“Who are these people?” said the prince."
"“They say that they have come on business, and they are the kind of men,
who, if you do not see them here, will follow you about the street."
"It would be better to receive them, and then you will get rid of them."
"Gavrila Ardalionovitch and Ptitsin are both there, trying to make them
hear reason.”

“Pavlicheff’s son!"
It is not worth while!” cried Lebedeff.
"“There is
no necessity to see them, and it would be most unpleasant for your
excellency."
"They do not deserve...”

“What?"
"Pavlicheff’s son!” cried the prince, much perturbed."
“I know...
I know--but I entrusted this matter to Gavrila Ardalionovitch.
"He told
me...”

At that moment Gania, accompanied by Ptitsin, came out to the terrace."
"From an adjoining room came a noise of angry voices, and General
Ivolgin, in loud tones, seemed to be trying to shout them down."
"Colia
rushed off at once to investigate the cause of the uproar."
“This is most interesting!” observed Evgenie Pavlovitch.
“I expect he knows all about it!” thought the prince.
"“What, the son of Pavlicheff?"
"And who may this son of Pavlicheff be?”
 asked General Epanchin with surprise; and looking curiously around him,
he discovered that he alone had no clue to the mystery."
"Expectation and
suspense were on every face, with the exception of that of the prince,
who stood gravely wondering how an affair so entirely personal could
have awakened such lively and widespread interest in so short a time."
Aglaya went up to him with a peculiarly serious look.
"“It will be well,” she said, “if you put an end to this affair yourself
_at once_: but you must allow us to be your witnesses."
"They want to throw
mud at you, prince, and you must be triumphantly vindicated."
"I give you
joy beforehand!”

“And I also wish for justice to be done, once for all,” cried Madame
Epanchin, “about this impudent claim."
"Deal with them promptly, prince,
and don’t spare them!"
"I am sick of hearing about the affair, and many a
quarrel I have had in your cause."
"But I confess I am anxious to see what
happens, so do make them come out here, and we will remain."
"You have
heard people talking about it, no doubt?” she added, turning to Prince
S.

“Of course,” said he."
"“I have heard it spoken about at your house, and I
am anxious to see these young men!”

“They are Nihilists, are they not?”

“No, they are not Nihilists,” explained Lebedeff, who seemed much
excited."
“This is another lot--a special group.
"According to my nephew
they are more advanced even than the Nihilists."
"You are quite wrong,
excellency, if you think that your presence will intimidate them;
nothing intimidates them."
"Educated men, learned men even, are to be
found among Nihilists; these go further, in that they are men of action."
"The movement is, properly speaking, a derivative from Nihilism--though
they are only known indirectly, and by hearsay, for they never advertise
their doings in the papers."
They go straight to the point.
"For them, it
is not a question of showing that Pushkin is stupid, or that Russia must
be torn in pieces."
"No; but if they have a great desire for anything,
they believe they have a right to get it even at the cost of the lives,
say, of eight persons."
They are checked by no obstacles.
"In fact,
prince, I should not advise you...”

But Muishkin had risen, and was on his way to open the door for his
visitors."
"“You are slandering them, Lebedeff,” said he, smiling."
“You are always thinking about your nephew’s conduct.
"Don’t believe
him, Lizabetha Prokofievna."
"I can assure you Gorsky and Daniloff are
exceptions--and that these are only... mistaken."
"However, I do not care
about receiving them here, in public."
"Excuse me, Lizabetha Prokofievna."
"They are coming, and you can see them, and then I will take them away."
"Please come in, gentlemen!”

Another thought tormented him: He wondered was this an arranged
business--arranged to happen when he had guests in his house, and in
anticipation of his humiliation rather than of his triumph?"
"But he
reproached himself bitterly for such a thought, and felt as if he should
die of shame if it were discovered."
"When his new visitors appeared, he
was quite ready to believe himself infinitely less to be respected than
any of them."
"Four persons entered, led by General Ivolgin, in a state of great
excitement, and talking eloquently."
"“He is for me, undoubtedly!” thought the prince, with a smile."
"Colia
also had joined the party, and was talking with animation to Hippolyte,
who listened with a jeering smile on his lips."
The prince begged the visitors to sit down.
"They were all so young that
it made the proceedings seem even more extraordinary."
"Ivan Fedorovitch,
who really understood nothing of what was going on, felt indignant at
the sight of these youths, and would have interfered in some way had it
not been for the extreme interest shown by his wife in the affair."
"He therefore remained, partly through curiosity, partly through
good-nature, hoping that his presence might be of some use."
"But the bow
with which General Ivolgin greeted him irritated him anew; he frowned,
and decided to be absolutely silent."
"As to the rest, one was a man of thirty, the retired officer, now a
boxer, who had been with Rogojin, and in his happier days had given
fifteen roubles at a time to beggars."
"Evidently he had joined the others
as a comrade to give them moral, and if necessary material, support."
"The
man who had been spoken of as “Pavlicheff’s son,” although he gave the
name of Antip Burdovsky, was about twenty-two years of age, fair,
thin and rather tall."
"He was remarkable for the poverty, not to say
uncleanliness, of his personal appearance: the sleeves of his overcoat
were greasy; his dirty waistcoat, buttoned up to his neck, showed not a
trace of linen; a filthy black silk scarf, twisted till it resembled a
cord, was round his neck, and his hands were unwashed."
"He looked round
with an air of insolent effrontery."
"His face, covered with pimples,
was neither thoughtful nor even contemptuous; it wore an expression
of complacent satisfaction in demanding his rights and in being an
aggrieved party."
"His voice trembled, and he spoke so fast, and with such
stammerings, that he might have been taken for a foreigner, though
the purest Russian blood ran in his veins."
"Lebedeff’s nephew, whom
the reader has seen already, accompanied him, and also the youth named
Hippolyte Terentieff."
The latter was only seventeen or eighteen.
"He
had an intelligent face, though it was usually irritated and fretful
in expression."
"His skeleton-like figure, his ghastly complexion, the
brightness of his eyes, and the red spots of colour on his cheeks,
betrayed the victim of consumption to the most casual glance."
"He coughed
persistently, and panted for breath; it looked as though he had but
a few weeks more to live."
"He was nearly dead with fatigue, and fell,
rather than sat, into a chair."
"The rest bowed as they came in; and being
more or less abashed, put on an air of extreme self-assurance."
"In short,
their attitude was not that which one would have expected in men who
professed to despise all trivialities, all foolish mundane conventions,
and indeed everything, except their own personal interests."
"“Antip Burdovsky,” stuttered the son of Pavlicheff."
"“Vladimir Doktorenko,” said Lebedeff’s nephew briskly, and with a
certain pride, as if he boasted of his name."
"“Keller,” murmured the retired officer."
"“Hippolyte Terentieff,” cried the last-named, in a shrill voice."
"They sat now in a row facing the prince, and frowned, and played with
their caps."
"All appeared ready to speak, and yet all were silent; the
defiant expression on their faces seemed to say, “No, sir, you don’t
take us in!” It could be felt that the first word spoken by anyone
present would bring a torrent of speech from the whole deputation."
VIII.
"“I _did_ not expect you, gentlemen,” began the prince."
"“I have been ill
until to-day."
"A month ago,” he continued, addressing himself to Antip
Burdovsky, “I put your business into Gavrila Ardalionovitch Ivolgin’s
hands, as I told you then."
"I do not in the least object to having a
personal interview... but you will agree with me that this is hardly the
time..."
"I propose that we go into another room, if you will not keep me
long... As you see, I have friends here, and believe me...”

“Friends as many as you please, but allow me,” interrupted the harsh
voice of Lebedeff’s nephew--“allow me to tell you that you might have
treated us rather more politely, and not have kept us waiting at least
two hours...

“No doubt... and I... is that acting like a prince?"
"And you... you may
be a general!"
But I...
I am not your valet!
And I...
"I...” stammered
Antip Burdovsky."
"He was extremely excited; his lips trembled, and the resentment of an
embittered soul was in his voice."
"But he spoke so indistinctly that
hardly a dozen words could be gathered."
“It was a princely action!” sneered Hippolyte.
"“If anyone had treated me so,” grumbled the boxer."
"“I mean to say that if I had been in Burdovsky’s place...I...”

“Gentlemen, I did not know you were there; I have only just been
informed, I assure you,” repeated Muishkin."
"“We are not afraid of your friends, prince,” remarked Lebedeff’s nephew,
“for we are within our rights.”

The shrill tones of Hippolyte interrupted him."
"“What right have you...
by what right do you demand us to submit this matter, about Burdovsky...
to the judgment of your friends?"
"We know only too well what the judgment
of your friends will be!...”

This beginning gave promise of a stormy discussion."
"The prince was
much discouraged, but at last he managed to make himself heard amid the
vociferations of his excited visitors."
"“If you,” he said, addressing Burdovsky--“if you prefer not to speak
here, I offer again to go into another room with you... and as to your
waiting to see me, I repeat that I only this instant heard...”

“Well, you have no right, you have no right, no right at all!..."
"Your
friends indeed!”... gabbled Burdovsky, defiantly examining the faces
round him, and becoming more and more excited."
"“You have no right!...”
 As he ended thus abruptly, he leant forward, staring at the prince with
his short-sighted, bloodshot eyes."
"The latter was so astonished, that he
did not reply, but looked steadily at him in return."
"“Lef Nicolaievitch!” interposed Madame Epanchin, suddenly, “read this at
once, this very moment!"
"It is about this business.”

She held out a weekly comic paper, pointing to an article on one of
its pages."
"Just as the visitors were coming in, Lebedeff, wishing to
ingratiate himself with the great lady, had pulled this paper from his
pocket, and presented it to her, indicating a few columns marked in
pencil."
"Lizabetha Prokofievna had had time to read some of it, and was
greatly upset."
"“Would it not be better to peruse it alone... later,” asked the prince,
nervously."
"“No, no, read it--read it at once directly, and aloud, aloud!” cried
she, calling Colia to her and giving him the journal.--“Read it aloud,
so that everyone may hear it!”

An impetuous woman, Lizabetha Prokofievna sometimes weighed her anchors
and put out to sea quite regardless of the possible storms she might
encounter."
"Ivan Fedorovitch felt a sudden pang of alarm, but the others
were merely curious, and somewhat surprised."
"Colia unfolded the paper,
and began to read, in his clear, high-pitched voice, the following
article:

“Proletarians and scions of nobility!"
"An episode of the brigandage of
today and every day!"
Progress!
Reform!
"Justice!”

“Strange things are going on in our so-called Holy Russia in this age of
reform and great enterprises; this age of patriotism in which hundreds
of millions are yearly sent abroad; in which industry is encouraged, and
the hands of Labour paralyzed, etc."
"; there is no end to this, gentlemen,
so let us come to the point."
"A strange thing has happened to a scion
of our defunct aristocracy."
"(_De profundis!_) The grandfathers of these
scions ruined themselves at the gaming-tables; their fathers were forced
to serve as officers or subalterns; some have died just as they were
about to be tried for innocent thoughtlessness in the handling of public
funds."
"Their children are sometimes congenital idiots, like the hero of
our story; sometimes they are found in the dock at the Assizes, where
they are generally acquitted by the jury for edifying motives; sometimes
they distinguish themselves by one of those burning scandals that amaze
the public and add another blot to the stained record of our age."
"Six
months ago--that is, last winter--this particular scion returned to
Russia, wearing gaiters like a foreigner, and shivering with cold in
an old scantily-lined cloak."
"He had come from Switzerland, where he
had just undergone a successful course of treatment for idiocy (_sic!_)."
"Certainly Fortune favoured him, for, apart from the interesting malady
of which he was cured in Switzerland (can there be a cure for idiocy?)"
"his story proves the truth of the Russian proverb that ‘happiness is
the right of certain classes!’ Judge for yourselves."
"Our subject was an
infant in arms when he lost his father, an officer who died just as
he was about to be court-martialled for gambling away the funds of his
company, and perhaps also for flogging a subordinate to excess (remember
the good old days, gentlemen)."
"The orphan was brought up by the charity
of a very rich Russian landowner."
"In the good old days, this man,
whom we will call P----, owned four thousand souls as serfs (souls as
serfs!--can you understand such an expression, gentlemen?"
"I cannot; it
must be looked up in a dictionary before one can understand it; these
things of a bygone day are already unintelligible to us)."
"He appears
to have been one of those Russian parasites who lead an idle existence
abroad, spending the summer at some spa, and the winter in Paris, to the
greater profit of the organizers of public balls."
"It may safely be said
that the manager of the Chateau des Fleurs (lucky man!)"
"pocketed at
least a third of the money paid by Russian peasants to their lords in
the days of serfdom."
"However this may be, the gay P---- brought up the
orphan like a prince, provided him with tutors and governesses (pretty,
of course!)"
whom he chose himself in Paris.
"But the little aristocrat,
the last of his noble race, was an idiot."
"The governesses, recruited at
the Chateau des Fleurs, laboured in vain; at twenty years of age their
pupil could not speak in any language, not even Russian."
"But ignorance
of the latter was still excusable."
"At last P---- was seized with a
strange notion; he imagined that in Switzerland they could change an
idiot into a man of sense."
"After all, the idea was quite logical;
a parasite and landowner naturally supposed that intelligence was a
marketable commodity like everything else, and that in Switzerland
especially it could be bought for money."
"The case was entrusted to a
celebrated Swiss professor, and cost thousands of roubles; the
treatment lasted five years."
"Needless to say, the idiot did not become
intelligent, but it is alleged that he grew into something more or less
resembling a man."
"At this stage P---- died suddenly, and, as usual,
he had made no will and left his affairs in disorder."
"A crowd of eager
claimants arose, who cared nothing about any last scion of a noble race
undergoing treatment in Switzerland, at the expense of the deceased, as
a congenital idiot."
"Idiot though he was, the noble scion tried to cheat
his professor, and they say he succeeded in getting him to continue
the treatment gratis for two years, by concealing the death of his
benefactor."
But the professor himself was a charlatan.
"Getting anxious
at last when no money was forthcoming, and alarmed above all by his
patient’s appetite, he presented him with a pair of old gaiters and a
shabby cloak and packed him off to Russia, third class."
"It would seem
that Fortune had turned her back upon our hero."
"Not at all; Fortune,
who lets whole populations die of hunger, showered all her gifts at once
upon the little aristocrat, like Kryloff’s Cloud which passes over an
arid plain and empties itself into the sea."
"He had scarcely arrived in
St. Petersburg, when a relation of his mother’s (who was of bourgeois
origin, of course), died at Moscow."
"He was a merchant, an Old Believer,
and he had no children."
"He left a fortune of several millions in good
current coin, and everything came to our noble scion, our gaitered
baron, formerly treated for idiocy in a Swiss lunatic asylum."
"Instantly
the scene changed, crowds of friends gathered round our baron, who
meanwhile had lost his head over a celebrated demi-mondaine; he even
discovered some relations; moreover a number of young girls of high
birth burned to be united to him in lawful matrimony."
"Could anyone
possibly imagine a better match?"
"Aristocrat, millionaire, and idiot, he
has every advantage!"
"One might hunt in vain for his equal, even with the
lantern of Diogenes; his like is not to be had even by getting it made
to order!”

“Oh, I don’t know what this means” cried Ivan Fedorovitch, transported
with indignation."
"“Leave off, Colia,” begged the prince."
Exclamations arose on all sides.
"“Let him go on reading at all costs!” ordered Lizabetha Prokofievna,
evidently preserving her composure by a desperate effort."
"“Prince, if
the reading is stopped, you and I will quarrel.”

Colia had no choice but to obey."
"With crimson cheeks he read on
unsteadily:

“But while our young millionaire dwelt as it were in the Empyrean,
something new occurred."
"One fine morning a man called upon him, calm and
severe of aspect, distinguished, but plainly dressed."
"Politely, but in
dignified terms, as befitted his errand, he briefly explained the motive
for his visit."
"He was a lawyer of enlightened views; his client was a
young man who had consulted him in confidence."
"This young man was no
other than the son of P----, though he bears another name."
"In his youth
P----, the sensualist, had seduced a young girl, poor but respectable."
"She
was a serf, but had received a European education."
"Finding that a child
was expected, he hastened her marriage with a man of noble character who
had loved her for a long time."
"He helped the young couple for a time,
but he was soon obliged to give up, for the high-minded husband refused
to accept anything from him."
"Soon the careless nobleman forgot all about
his former mistress and the child she had borne him; then, as we know,
he died intestate."
"P----’s son, born after his mother’s marriage, found
a true father in the generous man whose name he bore."
"But when he also
died, the orphan was left to provide for himself, his mother now being
an invalid who had lost the use of her limbs."
"Leaving her in a distant
province, he came to the capital in search of pupils."
"By dint of daily
toil he earned enough to enable him to follow the college courses, and
at last to enter the university."
"But what can one earn by teaching the
children of Russian merchants at ten copecks a lesson, especially with
an invalid mother to keep?"
"Even her death did not much diminish the
hardships of the young man’s struggle for existence."
"Now this is the
question: how, in the name of justice, should our scion have argued the
case?"
"Our readers will think, no doubt, that he would say to himself:
‘P---- showered benefits upon me all my life; he spent tens of thousands
of roubles to educate me, to provide me with governesses, and to keep me
under treatment in Switzerland."
"Now I am a millionaire, and P----’s son,
a noble young man who is not responsible for the faults of his careless
and forgetful father, is wearing himself out giving ill-paid lessons."
"According to justice, all that was done for me ought to have been done
for him."
"The enormous sums spent upon me were not really mine; they
came to me by an error of blind Fortune, when they ought to have gone to
P----’s son."
"They should have gone to benefit him, not me, in whom P----
interested himself by a mere caprice, instead of doing his duty as a
father."
"If I wished to behave nobly, justly, and with delicacy, I ought
to bestow half my fortune upon the son of my benefactor; but as economy
is my favourite virtue, and I know this is not a case in which the law
can intervene, I will not give up half my millions."
"But it would be too
openly vile, too flagrantly infamous, if I did not at least restore to
P----’s son the tens of thousands of roubles spent in curing my idiocy."
This is simply a case of conscience and of strict justice.
"Whatever
would have become of me if P---- had not looked after my education, and
had taken care of his own son instead of me?’

“No, gentlemen, our scions of the nobility do not reason thus."
"The
lawyer, who had taken up the matter purely out of friendship to the
young man, and almost against his will, invoked every consideration
of justice, delicacy, honour, and even plain figures; in vain, the
ex-patient of the Swiss lunatic asylum was inflexible."
"All this might
pass, but the sequel is absolutely unpardonable, and not to be excused
by any interesting malady."
"This millionaire, having but just discarded
the old gaiters of his professor, could not even understand that
the noble young man slaving away at his lessons was not asking for
charitable help, but for his rightful due, though the debt was not a
legal one; that, correctly speaking, he was not asking for anything, but
it was merely his friends who had thought fit to bestir themselves on
his behalf."
"With the cool insolence of a bloated capitalist, secure in
his millions, he majestically drew a banknote for fifty roubles from his
pocket-book and sent it to the noble young man as a humiliating piece of
charity."
"You can hardly believe it, gentlemen!"
"You are scandalized and
disgusted; you cry out in indignation!"
But that is what he did!
"Needless
to say, the money was returned, or rather flung back in his face."
"The
case is not within the province of the law, it must be referred to the
tribunal of public opinion; this is what we now do, guaranteeing the
truth of all the details which we have related.”

When Colia had finished reading, he handed the paper to the prince, and
retired silently to a corner of the room, hiding his face in his
hands."
"He was overcome by a feeling of inexpressible shame; his boyish
sensitiveness was wounded beyond endurance."
"It seemed to him that
something extraordinary, some sudden catastrophe had occurred, and that
he was almost the cause of it, because he had read the article aloud."
Yet all the others were similarly affected.
"The girls were uncomfortable
and ashamed."
"Lizabetha Prokofievna restrained her violent anger by a
great effort; perhaps she bitterly regretted her interference in the
matter; for the present she kept silence."
"The prince felt as very shy
people often do in such a case; he was so ashamed of the conduct of
other people, so humiliated for his guests, that he dared not look them
in the face."
"Ptitsin, Varia, Gania, and Lebedeff himself, all looked
rather confused."
"Stranger still, Hippolyte and the “son of Pavlicheff”
 also seemed slightly surprised, and Lebedeff’s nephew was obviously
far from pleased."
"The boxer alone was perfectly calm; he twisted his
moustaches with affected dignity, and if his eyes were cast down it was
certainly not in confusion, but rather in noble modesty, as if he did
not wish to be insolent in his triumph."
"It was evident that he was
delighted with the article."
"“The devil knows what it means,” growled Ivan Fedorovitch, under his
breath; “it must have taken the united wits of fifty footmen to write
it.”

“May I ask your reason for such an insulting supposition, sir?” said
Hippolyte, trembling with rage."
"“You will admit yourself, general, that for an honourable man, if the
author is an honourable man, that is an--an insult,” growled the boxer
suddenly, with convulsive jerkings of his shoulders."
"“In the first place, it is not for you to address me as ‘sir,’ and,
in the second place, I refuse to give you any explanation,” said Ivan
Fedorovitch vehemently; and he rose without another word, and went and
stood on the first step of the flight that led from the verandah to the
street, turning his back on the company."
"He was indignant with Lizabetha
Prokofievna, who did not think of moving even now."
"“Gentlemen, gentlemen, let me speak at last,” cried the prince, anxious
and agitated."
“Please let us understand one another.
"I say nothing about
the article, gentlemen, except that every word is false; I say this
because you know it as well as I do."
It is shameful.
"I should be
surprised if any one of you could have written it.”

“I did not know of its existence till this moment,” declared Hippolyte."
"“I do not approve of it.”

“I knew it had been written, but I would not have advised its
publication,” said Lebedeff’s nephew, “because it is premature.”

“I knew it, but I have a right."
I...
"I...” stammered the “son of
Pavlicheff.”

“What!"
Did you write all that yourself?
"Is it possible?” asked the
prince, regarding Burdovsky with curiosity."
"“One might dispute your right to ask such questions,” observed
Lebedeff’s nephew."
"“I was only surprised that Mr. Burdovsky should have--however, this is
what I have to say."
"Since you had already given the matter publicity,
why did you object just now, when I began to speak of it to my friends?”

“At last!” murmured Lizabetha Prokofievna indignantly."
"Lebedeff could restrain himself no longer; he made his way through the
row of chairs."
"“Prince,” he cried, “you are forgetting that if you consented to receive
and hear them, it was only because of your kind heart which has no
equal, for they had not the least right to demand it, especially as you
had placed the matter in the hands of Gavrila Ardalionovitch, which
was also extremely kind of you."
"You are also forgetting, most excellent
prince, that you are with friends, a select company; you cannot
sacrifice them to these gentlemen, and it is only for you to have them
turned out this instant."
"As the master of the house I shall have great
pleasure ....”

“Quite right!” agreed General Ivolgin in a loud voice."
"“That will do, Lebedeff, that will do--” began the prince, when an
indignant outcry drowned his words."
"“Excuse me, prince, excuse me, but now that will not do,” shouted
Lebedeff’s nephew, his voice dominating all the others."
"“The matter must
be clearly stated, for it is obviously not properly understood."
"They
are calling in some legal chicanery, and upon that ground they are
threatening to turn us out of the house!"
"Really, prince, do you think we
are such fools as not to be aware that this matter does not come within
the law, and that legally we cannot claim a rouble from you?"
"But we are
also aware that if actual law is not on our side, human law is for us,
natural law, the law of common-sense and conscience, which is no less
binding upon every noble and honest man--that is, every man of sane
judgment--because it is not to be found in miserable legal codes."
"If we
come here without fear of being turned out (as was threatened just now)
because of the imperative tone of our demand, and the unseemliness of
such a visit at this late hour (though it was not late when we arrived,
we were kept waiting in your anteroom), if, I say, we came in without
fear, it is just because we expected to find you a man of sense; I mean,
a man of honour and conscience."
"It is quite true that we did not present
ourselves humbly, like your flatterers and parasites, but holding up our
heads as befits independent men."
"We present no petition, but a proud and
free demand (note it well, we do not beseech, we demand!)."
"We ask you
fairly and squarely in a dignified manner."
"Do you believe that in this
affair of Burdovsky you have right on your side?"
"Do you admit that
Pavlicheff overwhelmed you with benefits, and perhaps saved your life?"
"If you admit it (which we take for granted), do you intend, now that you
are a millionaire, and do you not think it in conformity with justice,
to indemnify Burdovsky?"
Yes or no?
"If it is yes, or, in other words, if
you possess what you call honour and conscience, and we more justly call
common-sense, then accede to our demand, and the matter is at an end."
"Give us satisfaction, without entreaties or thanks from us; do not
expect thanks from us, for what you do will be done not for our sake,
but for the sake of justice."
"If you refuse to satisfy us, that is, if
your answer is no, we will go away at once, and there will be an end of
the matter."
"But we will tell you to your face before the present company
that you are a man of vulgar and undeveloped mind; we will openly deny
you the right to speak in future of your honour and conscience, for you
have not paid the fair price of such a right."
"I have no more to say--I
have put the question before you."
Now turn us out if you dare.
"You can
do it; force is on your side."
"But remember that we do not beseech, we
demand!"
"We do not beseech, we demand!”

With these last excited words, Lebedeff’s nephew was silent."
"“We demand, we demand, we demand, we do not beseech,” spluttered
Burdovsky, red as a lobster."
"The speech of Lebedeff’s nephew caused a certain stir among the company;
murmurs arose, though with the exception of Lebedeff, who was still
very much excited, everyone was careful not to interfere in the matter."
"Strangely enough, Lebedeff, although on the prince’s side, seemed quite
proud of his nephew’s eloquence."
"Gratified vanity was visible in the
glances he cast upon the assembled company."
"“In my opinion, Mr. Doktorenko,” said the prince, in rather a low
voice, “you are quite right in at least half of what you say."
"I would
go further and say that you are altogether right, and that I quite agree
with you, if there were not something lacking in your speech."
"I cannot
undertake to say precisely what it is, but you have certainly omitted
something, and you cannot be quite just while there is something
lacking."
But let us put that aside and return to the point.
"Tell me what
induced you to publish this article."
"Every word of it is a calumny, and
I think, gentlemen, that you have been guilty of a mean action.”

“Allow me--”

“Sir--”

“What?"
What?
"What?” cried all the visitors at once, in violent
agitation."
"“As to the article,” said Hippolyte in his croaking voice, “I have told
you already that we none of us approve of it!"
"There is the writer,” he
added, pointing to the boxer, who sat beside him."
"“I quite admit that he
has written it in his old regimental manner, with an equal disregard
for style and decency."
"I know he is a cross between a fool and an
adventurer; I make no bones about telling him so to his face every day."
"But after all he is half justified; publicity is the lawful right of
every man; consequently, Burdovsky is not excepted."
"Let him answer for
his own blunders."
"As to the objection which I made just now in the name
of all, to the presence of your friends, I think I ought to explain,
gentlemen, that I only did so to assert our rights, though we really
wished to have witnesses; we had agreed unanimously upon the point
before we came in."
"We do not care who your witnesses may be, or
whether they are your friends or not."
"As they cannot fail to recognize
Burdovsky’s right (seeing that it is mathematically demonstrable), it is
just as well that the witnesses should be your friends."
"The truth will
only be more plainly evident.”

“It is quite true; we had agreed upon that point,” said Lebedeff’s
nephew, in confirmation."
"“If that is the case, why did you begin by making such a fuss about it?”
 asked the astonished prince."
"The boxer was dying to get in a few words; owing, no doubt, to the
presence of the ladies, he was becoming quite jovial."
"“As to the article, prince,” he said, “I admit that I wrote it, in spite
of the severe criticism of my poor friend, in whom I always overlook
many things because of his unfortunate state of health."
"But I wrote and
published it in the form of a letter, in the paper of a friend."
"I showed
it to no one but Burdovsky, and I did not read it all through, even to
him."
"He immediately gave me permission to publish it, but you will admit
that I might have done so without his consent."
"Publicity is a noble,
beneficent, and universal right."
"I hope, prince, that you are too
progressive to deny this?”

“I deny nothing, but you must confess that your article--”

“Is a bit thick, you mean?"
"Well, in a way that is in the public
interest; you will admit that yourself, and after all one cannot
overlook a blatant fact."
"So much the worse for the guilty parties,
but the public welfare must come before everything."
"As to certain
inaccuracies and figures of speech, so to speak, you will also admit
that the motive, aim, and intention, are the chief thing."
"It is a
question, above all, of making a wholesome example; the individual case
can be examined afterwards; and as to the style--well, the thing was
meant to be humorous, so to speak, and, after all, everybody writes like
that; you must admit it yourself!"
"Ha, ha!”

“But, gentlemen, I assure you that you are quite astray,” exclaimed the
prince."
"“You have published this article upon the supposition that I
would never consent to satisfy Mr. Burdovsky."
"Acting on that conviction,
you have tried to intimidate me by this publication and to be revenged
for my supposed refusal."
But what did you know of my intentions?
"It may
be that I have resolved to satisfy Mr. Burdovsky’s claim."
"I now declare
openly, in the presence of these witnesses, that I will do so.”

“The noble and intelligent word of an intelligent and most noble man, at
last!” exclaimed the boxer."
“Good God!” exclaimed Lizabetha Prokofievna involuntarily.
"“This is intolerable,” growled the general."
"“Allow me, gentlemen, allow me,” urged the prince."
“I will explain matters to you.
"Five weeks ago I received a visit from
Tchebaroff, your agent, Mr. Burdovsky."
"You have given a very flattering
description of him in your article, Mr. Keller,” he continued, turning
to the boxer with a smile, “but he did not please me at all."
"I saw at
once that Tchebaroff was the moving spirit in the matter, and, to speak
frankly, I thought he might have induced you, Mr. Burdovsky, to make
this claim, by taking advantage of your simplicity.”

“You have no right...."
"I am not simple,” stammered Burdovsky, much
agitated."
"“You have no sort of right to suppose such things,” said Lebedeff’s
nephew in a tone of authority."
"“It is most offensive!” shrieked Hippolyte; “it is an insulting
suggestion, false, and most ill-timed.”

“I beg your pardon, gentlemen; please excuse me,” said the prince."
"“I
thought absolute frankness on both sides would be best, but have it your
own way."
"I told Tchebaroff that, as I was not in Petersburg, I would
commission a friend to look into the matter without delay, and that I
would let you know, Mr. Burdovsky."
"Gentlemen, I have no hesitation in
telling you that it was the fact of Tchebaroff’s intervention that made
me suspect a fraud."
Oh!
"do not take offence at my words, gentlemen,
for Heaven’s sake do not be so touchy!” cried the prince, seeing that
Burdovsky was getting excited again, and that the rest were preparing
to protest."
"“If I say I suspected a fraud, there is nothing personal in
that."
"I had never seen any of you then; I did not even know your names;
I only judged by Tchebaroff; I am speaking quite generally--if you only
knew how I have been ‘done’ since I came into my fortune!”

“You are shockingly naive, prince,” said Lebedeff’s nephew in mocking
tones."
"“Besides, though you are a prince and a millionaire, and even though
you may really be simple and good-hearted, you can hardly be outside the
general law,” Hippolyte declared loudly."
"“Perhaps not; it is very possible,” the prince agreed hastily, “though I
do not know what general law you allude to."
"I will go on--only please
do not take offence without good cause."
"I assure you I do not mean to
offend you in the least."
"Really, it is impossible to speak three words
sincerely without your flying into a rage!"
"At first I was amazed when
Tchebaroff told me that Pavlicheff had a son, and that he was in such
a miserable position."
"Pavlicheff was my benefactor, and my father’s
friend."
"Oh, Mr. Keller, why does your article impute things to my father
without the slightest foundation?"
"He never squandered the funds of his
company nor ill-treated his subordinates, I am absolutely certain of it;
I cannot imagine how you could bring yourself to write such a calumny!"
But your assertions concerning Pavlicheff are absolutely intolerable!
"You do not scruple to make a libertine of that noble man; you call him a
sensualist as coolly as if you were speaking the truth, and yet it would
not be possible to find a chaster man."
"He was even a scholar of note,
and in correspondence with several celebrated scientists, and spent
large sums in the interests of science."
"As to his kind heart and his
good actions, you were right indeed when you said that I was almost an
idiot at that time, and could hardly understand anything--(I could
speak and understand Russian, though),--but now I can appreciate what I
remember--”

“Excuse me,” interrupted Hippolyte, “is not this rather sentimental?"
"You
said you wished to come to the point; please remember that it is after
nine o’clock.”

“Very well, gentlemen--very well,” replied the prince."
"“At first I
received the news with mistrust, then I said to myself that I might be
mistaken, and that Pavlicheff might possibly have had a son."
"But I was
absolutely amazed at the readiness with which the son had revealed
the secret of his birth at the expense of his mother’s honour."
"For
Tchebaroff had already menaced me with publicity in our interview....”

“What nonsense!” Lebedeff’s nephew interrupted violently."
“You have no right--you have no right!” cried Burdovsky.
"“The son is not responsible for the misdeeds of his father; and the
mother is not to blame,” added Hippolyte, with warmth."
"“That seems to me all the more reason for sparing her,” said the prince
timidly."
"“Prince, you are not only simple, but your simplicity is almost past the
limit,” said Lebedeff’s nephew, with a sarcastic smile."
“But what right had you?” said Hippolyte in a very strange tone.
"“None--none whatever,” agreed the prince hastily."
"“I admit you are right
there, but it was involuntary, and I immediately said to myself that my
personal feelings had nothing to do with it,--that if I thought it right
to satisfy the demands of Mr. Burdovsky, out of respect for the memory
of Pavlicheff, I ought to do so in any case, whether I esteemed Mr.
Burdovsky or not."
"I only mentioned this, gentlemen, because it seemed so
unnatural to me for a son to betray his mother’s secret in such a way."
"In short, that is what convinced me that Tchebaroff must be a rogue, and
that he had induced Mr. Burdovsky to attempt this fraud.”

“But this is intolerable!” cried the visitors, some of them starting to
their feet."
"“Gentlemen, I supposed from this that poor Mr. Burdovsky must be a
simple-minded man, quite defenceless, and an easy tool in the hands
of rogues."
"That is why I thought it my duty to try and help him
as ‘Pavlicheff’s son’; in the first place by rescuing him from the
influence of Tchebaroff, and secondly by making myself his friend."
"I
have resolved to give him ten thousand roubles; that is about the sum
which I calculate that Pavlicheff must have spent on me.”

“What, only ten thousand!” cried Hippolyte."
"“Well, prince, your arithmetic is not up to much, or else you are mighty
clever at it, though you affect the air of a simpleton,” said Lebedeff’s
nephew."
"“I will not accept ten thousand roubles,” said Burdovsky."
"“Accept, Antip,” whispered the boxer eagerly, leaning past the back of
Hippolyte’s chair to give his friend this piece of advice."
"“Take it for
the present; we can see about more later on.”

“Look here, Mr. Muishkin,” shouted Hippolyte, “please understand that we
are not fools, nor idiots, as your guests seem to imagine; these ladies
who look upon us with such scorn, and especially this fine gentleman”
 (pointing to Evgenie Pavlovitch) “whom I have not the honour of knowing,
though I think I have heard some talk about him--”

“Really, really, gentlemen,” cried the prince in great agitation, “you
are misunderstanding me again."
"In the first place, Mr. Keller, you have
greatly overestimated my fortune in your article."
"I am far from being
a millionaire."
I have barely a tenth of what you suppose.
"Secondly, my
treatment in Switzerland was very far from costing tens of thousands of
roubles."
"Schneider received six hundred roubles a year, and he was
only paid for the first three years."
"As to the pretty governesses whom
Pavlicheff is supposed to have brought from Paris, they only exist
in Mr. Keller’s imagination; it is another calumny."
"According to my
calculations, the sum spent on me was very considerably under ten
thousand roubles, but I decided on that sum, and you must admit that
in paying a debt I could not offer Mr. Burdovsky more, however kindly
disposed I might be towards him; delicacy forbids it; I should seem to
be offering him charity instead of rightful payment."
"I don’t know how
you cannot see that, gentlemen!"
"Besides, I had no intention of leaving
the matter there."
"I meant to intervene amicably later on and help to
improve poor Mr. Burdovsky’s position."
"It is clear that he has been
deceived, or he would never have agreed to anything so vile as the
scandalous revelations about his mother in Mr. Keller’s article."
"But,
gentlemen, why are you getting angry again?"
"Are we never to come to an
understanding?"
"Well, the event has proved me right!"
"I have just seen
with my own eyes the proof that my conjecture was correct!” he added,
with increasing eagerness."
"He meant to calm his hearers, and did not perceive that his words had
only increased their irritation."
“What do you mean?
What are you convinced of?” they demanded angrily.
"“In the first place, I have had the opportunity of getting a correct
idea of Mr. Burdovsky."
I see what he is for myself.
"He is an innocent
man, deceived by everyone!"
"A defenceless victim, who deserves
indulgence!"
"Secondly, Gavrila Ardalionovitch, in whose hands I had
placed the matter, had his first interview with me barely an hour ago."
"I had not heard from him for some time, as I was away, and have been ill
for three days since my return to St. Petersburg."
"He tells me that he
has exposed the designs of Tchebaroff and has proof that justifies my
opinion of him."
"I know, gentlemen, that many people think me an idiot."
"Counting upon my reputation as a man whose purse-strings are easily
loosened, Tchebaroff thought it would be a simple matter to fleece me,
especially by trading on my gratitude to Pavlicheff."
"But the main
point is--listen, gentlemen, let me finish!--the main point is that Mr.
Burdovsky is not Pavlicheff’s son at all."
"Gavrila Ardalionovitch has
just told me of his discovery, and assures me that he has positive
proofs."
"Well, what do you think of that?"
"It is scarcely credible, even
after all the tricks that have been played upon me."
"Please note that we
have positive proofs!"
"I can hardly believe it myself, I assure you; I do
not yet believe it; I am still doubtful, because Gavrila Ardalionovitch
has not had time to go into details; but there can be no further doubt
that Tchebaroff is a rogue!"
"He has deceived poor Mr. Burdovsky, and
all of you, gentlemen, who have come forward so nobly to support your
friend--(he evidently needs support, I quite see that!)."
"He has abused
your credulity and involved you all in an attempted fraud, for when all
is said and done this claim is nothing else!”

“What!"
a fraud?
"What, he is not Pavlicheff’s son?"
"Impossible!”

These exclamations but feebly expressed the profound bewilderment into
which the prince’s words had plunged Burdovsky’s companions."
“Certainly it is a fraud!
"Since Mr. Burdovsky is not Pavlicheff’s son,
his claim is neither more nor less than attempted fraud (supposing, of
course, that he had known the truth), but the fact is that he has been
deceived."
"I insist on this point in order to justify him; I repeat that
his simple-mindedness makes him worthy of pity, and that he cannot stand
alone; otherwise he would have behaved like a scoundrel in this matter."
But I feel certain that he does not understand it!
"I was just the same
myself before I went to Switzerland; I stammered incoherently; one tries
to express oneself and cannot."
I understand that.
"I am all the better
able to pity Mr. Burdovsky, because I know from experience what it is to
be like that, and so I have a right to speak."
"Well, though there is no
such person as ‘Pavlicheff’s son,’ and it is all nothing but a humbug,
yet I will keep to my decision, and I am prepared to give up ten
thousand roubles in memory of Pavlicheff."
"Before Mr. Burdovsky made this
claim, I proposed to found a school with this money, in memory of my
benefactor, but I shall honour his memory quite as well by giving
the ten thousand roubles to Mr. Burdovsky, because, though he was not
Pavlicheff’s son, he was treated almost as though he were."
"That is
what gave a rogue the opportunity of deceiving him; he really did
think himself Pavlicheff’s son."
"Listen, gentlemen; this matter must
be settled; keep calm; do not get angry; and sit down!"
"Gavrila
Ardalionovitch will explain everything to you at once, and I confess
that I am very anxious to hear all the details myself."
"He says that he
has even been to Pskoff to see your mother, Mr. Burdovsky; she is not
dead, as the article which was just read to us makes out."
"Sit down,
gentlemen, sit down!”

The prince sat down, and at length prevailed upon Burdovsky’s company
to do likewise."
"During the last ten or twenty minutes, exasperated by
continual interruptions, he had raised his voice, and spoken with
great vehemence."
"Now, no doubt, he bitterly regretted several words and
expressions which had escaped him in his excitement."
"If he had not been
driven beyond the limits of endurance, he would not have ventured to
express certain conjectures so openly."
"He had no sooner sat down than
his heart was torn by sharp remorse."
"Besides insulting Burdovsky
with the supposition, made in the presence of witnesses, that he was
suffering from the complaint for which he had himself been treated
in Switzerland, he reproached himself with the grossest indelicacy in
having offered him the ten thousand roubles before everyone."
"“I ought
to have waited till to-morrow and offered him the money when we were
alone,” thought Muishkin."
"“Now it is too late, the mischief is done!"
"Yes, I am an idiot, an absolute idiot!” he said to himself, overcome
with shame and regret."
Till then Gavrila Ardalionovitch had sat apart in silence.
"When the
prince called upon him, he came and stood by his side, and in a calm,
clear voice began to render an account of the mission confided to him."
All conversation ceased instantly.
"Everyone, especially the Burdovsky
party, listened with the utmost curiosity."
IX.
"“You will not deny, I am sure,” said Gavrila Ardalionovitch, turning
to Burdovsky, who sat looking at him with wide-open eyes, perplexed and
astonished."
"“You will not deny, seriously, that you were born just two
years after your mother’s legal marriage to Mr. Burdovsky, your father."
"Nothing would be easier than to prove the date of your birth from
well-known facts; we can only look on Mr. Keller’s version as a work of
imagination, and one, moreover, extremely offensive both to you and your
mother."
"Of course he distorted the truth in order to strengthen your
claim, and to serve your interests."
"Mr. Keller said that he previously
consulted you about his article in the paper, but did not read it to you
as a whole."
Certainly he could not have read that passage.
"....”

“As a matter of fact, I did not read it,” interrupted the boxer, “but
its contents had been given me on unimpeachable authority, and I...”

“Excuse me, Mr. Keller,” interposed Gavrila Ardalionovitch."
"“Allow me to
speak."
"I assure you your article shall be mentioned in its proper place,
and you can then explain everything, but for the moment I would rather
not anticipate."
"Quite accidentally, with the help of my sister, Varvara
Ardalionovna Ptitsin, I obtained from one of her intimate friends,
Madame Zoubkoff, a letter written to her twenty-five years ago,
by Nicolai Andreevitch Pavlicheff, then abroad."
"After getting
into communication with this lady, I went by her advice to Timofei
Fedorovitch Viazovkin, a retired colonel, and one of Pavlicheff’s oldest
friends."
"He gave me two more letters written by the latter when he was
still in foreign parts."
"These three documents, their dates, and the
facts mentioned in them, prove in the most undeniable manner, that
eighteen months before your birth, Nicolai Andreevitch went abroad,
where he remained for three consecutive years."
"Your mother, as you are
well aware, has never been out of Russia...."
"It is too late to read the
letters now; I am content to state the fact."
"But if you desire it, come
to me tomorrow morning, bring witnesses and writing experts with you,
and I will prove the absolute truth of my story."
"From that moment the
question will be decided.”

These words caused a sensation among the listeners, and there was a
general movement of relief."
Burdovsky got up abruptly.
"“If that is true,” said he, “I have been deceived, grossly deceived, but
not by Tchebaroff: and for a long time past, a long time."
"I do not
wish for experts, not I, nor to go to see you."
I believe you.
"I give it
up...."
But I refuse the ten thousand roubles.
"Good-bye.”

“Wait five minutes more, Mr. Burdovsky,” said Gavrila Ardalionovitch
pleasantly."
“I have more to say.
"Some rather curious and important facts
have come to light, and it is absolutely necessary, in my opinion, that
you should hear them."
"You will not regret, I fancy, to have the whole
matter thoroughly cleared up.”

Burdovsky silently resumed his seat, and bent his head as though in
profound thought."
"His friend, Lebedeff’s nephew, who had risen to
accompany him, also sat down again."
"He seemed much disappointed, though
as self-confident as ever."
"Hippolyte looked dejected and sulky, as well
as surprised."
"He had just been attacked by a violent fit of coughing,
so that his handkerchief was stained with blood."
"The boxer looked
thoroughly frightened."
"“Oh, Antip!” cried he in a miserable voice, “I did say to you the
other day--the day before yesterday--that perhaps you were not really
Pavlicheff’s son!”

There were sounds of half-smothered laughter at this."
"“Now, that is a valuable piece of information, Mr. Keller,” replied
Gania."
"“However that may be, I have private information which convinces
me that Mr. Burdovsky, though doubtless aware of the date of his birth,
knew nothing at all about Pavlicheff’s sojourn abroad."
"Indeed, he passed
the greater part of his life out of Russia, returning at intervals for
short visits."
"The journey in question is in itself too unimportant for
his friends to recollect it after more than twenty years; and of course
Mr. Burdovsky could have known nothing about it, for he was not born."
"As the event has proved, it was not impossible to find evidence of his
absence, though I must confess that chance has helped me in a quest
which might very well have come to nothing."
"It was really almost
impossible for Burdovsky or Tchebaroff to discover these facts, even if
it had entered their heads to try."
"Naturally they never dreamt...”

Here the voice of Hippolyte suddenly intervened."
"“Allow me, Mr. Ivolgin,” he said irritably."
"“What is the good of all
this rigmarole?"
Pardon me.
"All is now clear, and we acknowledge the
truth of your main point."
Why go into these tedious details?
"You wish
perhaps to boast of the cleverness of your investigation, to cry up your
talents as detective?"
"Or perhaps your intention is to excuse Burdovsky,
by proving that he took up the matter in ignorance?"
"Well, I consider that
extremely impudent on your part!"
"You ought to know that Burdovsky has
no need of being excused or justified by you or anyone else!"
"It is an
insult!"
The affair is quite painful enough for him without that.
"Will
nothing make you understand?”

“Enough!"
enough!
"Mr. Terentieff,” interrupted Gania."
"“Don’t excite yourself; you seem very ill, and I am sorry for that."
"I am
almost done, but there are a few facts to which I must briefly refer, as
I am convinced that they ought to be clearly explained once for all....”
 A movement of impatience was noticed in his audience as he resumed: “I
merely wish to state, for the information of all concerned, that the
reason for Mr. Pavlicheff’s interest in your mother, Mr. Burdovsky, was
simply that she was the sister of a serf-girl with whom he was deeply in
love in his youth, and whom most certainly he would have married but for
her sudden death."
"I have proofs that this circumstance is almost, if not
quite, forgotten."
"I may add that when your mother was about ten years
old, Pavlicheff took her under his care, gave her a good education, and
later, a considerable dowry."
"His relations were alarmed, and feared
he might go so far as to marry her, but she gave her hand to a young
land-surveyor named Burdovsky when she reached the age of twenty."
"I
can even say definitely that it was a marriage of affection."
"After his
wedding your father gave up his occupation as land-surveyor, and with
his wife’s dowry of fifteen thousand roubles went in for commercial
speculations."
"As he had had no experience, he was cheated on all sides,
and took to drink in order to forget his troubles."
"He shortened his life
by his excesses, and eight years after his marriage he died."
"Your mother
says herself that she was left in the direst poverty, and would have
died of starvation had it not been for Pavlicheff, who generously
allowed her a yearly pension of six hundred roubles."
"Many people recall
his extreme fondness for you as a little boy."
"Your mother confirms this,
and agrees with others in thinking that he loved you the more because
you were a sickly child, stammering in your speech, and almost
deformed--for it is known that all his life Nicolai Andreevitch had a
partiality for unfortunates of every kind, especially children."
"In my
opinion this is most important."
"I may add that I discovered yet another
fact, the last on which I employed my detective powers."
"Seeing how fond
Pavlicheff was of you,--it was thanks to him you went to school, and
also had the advantage of special teachers--his relations and servants
grew to believe that you were his son, and that your father had been
betrayed by his wife."
"I may point out that this idea was only accredited
generally during the last years of Pavlicheff’s life, when his
next-of-kin were trembling about the succession, when the earlier story
was quite forgotten, and when all opportunity for discovering the truth
had seemingly passed away."
"No doubt you, Mr. Burdovsky, heard this
conjecture, and did not hesitate to accept it as true."
"I have had the
honour of making your mother’s acquaintance, and I find that she knows
all about these reports."
"What she does not know is that you, her son,
should have listened to them so complaisantly."
"I found your respected
mother at Pskoff, ill and in deep poverty, as she has been ever since
the death of your benefactor."
"She told me with tears of gratitude how
you had supported her; she expects much of you, and believes fervently
in your future success...”

“Oh, this is unbearable!” said Lebedeff’s nephew impatiently."
"“What is
the good of all this romancing?”

“It is revolting and unseemly!” cried Hippolyte, jumping up in a fury."
Burdovsky alone sat silent and motionless.
"“What is the good of it?” repeated Gavrila Ardalionovitch, with
pretended surprise."
"“Well, firstly, because now perhaps Mr. Burdovsky
is quite convinced that Mr. Pavlicheff’s love for him came simply from
generosity of soul, and not from paternal duty."
"It was most necessary
to impress this fact upon his mind, considering that he approved of the
article written by Mr. Keller."
"I speak thus because I look on you, Mr.
Burdovsky, as an honourable man."
"Secondly, it appears that there was no
intention of cheating in this case, even on the part of Tchebaroff."
"I
wish to say this quite plainly, because the prince hinted a while
ago that I too thought it an attempt at robbery and extortion."
"On the
contrary, everyone has been quite sincere in the matter, and although
Tchebaroff may be somewhat of a rogue, in this business he has acted
simply as any sharp lawyer would do under the circumstances."
"He looked
at it as a case that might bring him in a lot of money, and he did not
calculate badly; because on the one hand he speculated on the generosity
of the prince, and his gratitude to the late Mr. Pavlicheff, and on
the other to his chivalrous ideas as to the obligations of honour and
conscience."
"As to Mr. Burdovsky, allowing for his principles, we may
acknowledge that he engaged in the business with very little personal
aim in view."
"At the instigation of Tchebaroff and his other friends,
he decided to make the attempt in the service of truth, progress, and
humanity."
"In short, the conclusion may be drawn that, in spite of all
appearances, Mr. Burdovsky is a man of irreproachable character, and
thus the prince can all the more readily offer him his friendship, and
the assistance of which he spoke just now...”

“Hush!"
hush!
"Gavrila Ardalionovitch!” cried Muishkin in dismay, but it
was too late."
"“I said, and I have repeated it over and over again,” shouted Burdovsky
furiously, “that I did not want the money."
I will not take it...
"why...I
will not..."
"I am going away!”

He was rushing hurriedly from the terrace, when Lebedeff’s nephew seized
his arms, and said something to him in a low voice."
"Burdovsky turned
quickly, and drawing an addressed but unsealed envelope from his pocket,
he threw it down on a little table beside the prince."
“There’s the money!...
How dare you?...
"The money!”

“Those are the two hundred and fifty roubles you dared to send him as a
charity, by the hands of Tchebaroff,” explained Doktorenko."
“The article in the newspaper put it at fifty!” cried Colia.
"“I beg your pardon,” said the prince, going up to Burdovsky."
"“I have
done you a great wrong, but I did not send you that money as a charity,
believe me."
And now I am again to blame.
"I offended you just now.” (The
prince was much distressed; he seemed worn out with fatigue, and spoke
almost incoherently.)"
"“I spoke of swindling... but I did not apply that
to you."
I was deceived ....
I said you were... afflicted... like me...
But you are not like me... you give lessons... you support your mother.
"I said you had dishonoured your mother, but you love her."
"She says so
herself..."
"I did not know... Gavrila Ardalionovitch did not tell me
that... Forgive me!"
"I dared to offer you ten thousand roubles, but I was
wrong."
"I ought to have done it differently, and now... there is no way
of doing it, for you despise me...”

“I declare, this is a lunatic asylum!” cried Lizabetha Prokofievna."
"“Of course it is a lunatic asylum!” repeated Aglaya sharply, but her
words were overpowered by other voices."
"Everybody was talking loudly,
making remarks and comments; some discussed the affair gravely, others
laughed."
Ivan Fedorovitch Epanchin was extremely indignant.
"He stood
waiting for his wife with an air of offended dignity."
"Lebedeff’s nephew
took up the word again."
"“Well, prince, to do you justice, you certainly know how to make the
most of your--let us call it infirmity, for the sake of politeness; you
have set about offering your money and friendship in such a way that
no self-respecting man could possibly accept them."
"This is an excess of
ingenuousness or of malice--you ought to know better than anyone which
word best fits the case.”

“Allow me, gentlemen,” said Gavrila Ardalionovitch, who had just
examined the contents of the envelope, “there are only a hundred roubles
here, not two hundred and fifty."
"I point this out, prince, to prevent
misunderstanding.”

“Never mind, never mind,” said the prince, signing to him to keep quiet."
"“But we do mind,” said Lebedeff’s nephew vehemently."
"“Prince, your
‘never mind’ is an insult to us."
"We have nothing to hide; our actions
can bear daylight."
"It is true that there are only a hundred roubles
instead of two hundred and fifty, but it is all the same.”

“Why, no, it is hardly the same,” remarked Gavrila Ardalionovitch, with
an air of ingenuous surprise."
"“Don’t interrupt, we are not such fools as you think, Mr. Lawyer,” cried
Lebedeff’s nephew angrily."
"“Of course there is a difference between
a hundred roubles and two hundred and fifty, but in this case the
principle is the main point, and that a hundred and fifty roubles
are missing is only a side issue."
"The point to be emphasized is that
Burdovsky will not accept your highness’s charity; he flings it back in
your face, and it scarcely matters if there are a hundred roubles or two
hundred and fifty."
"Burdovsky has refused ten thousand roubles; you
heard him."
"He would not have returned even a hundred roubles if he was
dishonest!"
"The hundred and fifty roubles were paid to Tchebaroff for
his travelling expenses."
"You may jeer at our stupidity and at our
inexperience in business matters; you have done all you could already to
make us look ridiculous; but do not dare to call us dishonest."
"The
four of us will club together every day to repay the hundred and fifty
roubles to the prince, if we have to pay it in instalments of a rouble
at a time, but we will repay it, with interest."
"Burdovsky is poor, he
has no millions."
"After his journey to see the prince Tchebaroff sent in
his bill."
"We counted on winning... Who would not have done the same in
such a case?”

“Who indeed?” exclaimed Prince S.

“I shall certainly go mad, if I stay here!” cried Lizabetha Prokofievna."
"“It reminds me,” said Evgenie Pavlovitch, laughing, “of the famous plea
of a certain lawyer who lately defended a man for murdering six people
in order to rob them."
He excused his client on the score of poverty.
"‘It is quite natural,’ he said in conclusion, ‘considering the state
of misery he was in, that he should have thought of murdering these six
people; which of you, gentlemen, would not have done the same in his
place?’”

“Enough,” cried Lizabetha Prokofievna abruptly, trembling with anger,
“we have had enough of this balderdash!”

In a state of terrible excitement she threw back her head, with flaming
eyes, casting looks of contempt and defiance upon the whole company,
in which she could no longer distinguish friend from foe."
"She had
restrained herself so long that she felt forced to vent her rage on
somebody."
"Those who knew Lizabetha Prokofievna saw at once how it was
with her."
"“She flies into these rages sometimes,” said Ivan Fedorovitch
to Prince S. the next day, “but she is not often so violent as she was
yesterday; it does not happen more than once in three years.”

“Be quiet, Ivan Fedorovitch!"
Leave me alone!” cried Mrs. Epanchin.
"“Why
do you offer me your arm now?"
"You had not sense enough to take me away
before."
"You are my husband, you are a father, it was your duty to drag
me away by force, if in my folly I refused to obey you and go quietly."
You might at least have thought of your daughters.
"We can find our
way out now without your help."
Here is shame enough for a year!
"Wait
a moment ‘till I thank the prince!"
"Thank you, prince, for the
entertainment you have given us!"
"It was most amusing to hear these young
men..."
"It is vile, vile!"
"A chaos, a scandal, worse than a nightmare!"
Is it possible that there can be many such people on earth?
"Be quiet,
Aglaya!"
"Be quiet, Alexandra!"
It is none of your business!
"Don’t fuss
round me like that, Evgenie Pavlovitch; you exasperate me!"
"So, my dear,”
 she cried, addressing the prince, “you go so far as to beg their
pardon!"
"He says, ‘Forgive me for offering you a fortune.’ And you, you
mountebank, what are you laughing at?” she cried, turning suddenly on
Lebedeff’s nephew."
"“‘We refuse ten thousand roubles; we do not beseech,
we demand!’ As if he did not know that this idiot will call on them
tomorrow to renew his offers of money and friendship."
"You will, won’t
you?"
You will?
"Come, will you, or won’t you?”

“I shall,” said the prince, with gentle humility."
“You hear him!
"You count upon it, too,” she continued, turning upon
Doktorenko."
"“You are as sure of him now as if you had the money in your
pocket."
"And there you are playing the swaggerer to throw dust in our
eyes!"
"No, my dear sir, you may take other people in!"
"I can see through
all your airs and graces, I see your game!”

“Lizabetha Prokofievna!” exclaimed the prince."
"“Come, Lizabetha Prokofievna, it is quite time for us to be going,
we will take the prince with us,” said Prince S. with a smile, in the
coolest possible way."
"The girls stood apart, almost frightened; their father was positively
horrified."
Mrs. Epanchin’s language astonished everybody.
"Some who stood
a little way off smiled furtively, and talked in whispers."
"Lebedeff wore
an expression of utmost ecstasy."
"“Chaos and scandal are to be found everywhere, madame,” remarked
Doktorenko, who was considerably put out of countenance."
“Not like this!
"Nothing like the spectacle you have just given us, sir,”
 answered Lizabetha Prokofievna, with a sort of hysterical rage."
"“Leave
me alone, will you?” she cried violently to those around her, who were
trying to keep her quiet."
"“No, Evgenie Pavlovitch, if, as you said
yourself just now, a lawyer said in open court that he found it quite
natural that a man should murder six people because he was in misery,
the world must be coming to an end."
I had not heard of it before.
"Now
I understand everything."
"And this stutterer, won’t he turn out a
murderer?” she cried, pointing to Burdovsky, who was staring at her with
stupefaction."
“I bet he will!
"He will have none of your money, possibly,
he will refuse it because his conscience will not allow him to accept
it, but he will go murdering you by night and walking off with your
cashbox, with a clear conscience!"
"He does not call it a dishonest action
but ‘the impulse of a noble despair’; ‘a negation’; or the devil knows
what!"
Bah!
"everything is upside down, everyone walks head downwards."
"A
young girl, brought up at home, suddenly jumps into a cab in the
middle of the street, saying: ‘Good-bye, mother, I married Karlitch, or
Ivanitch, the other day!’ And you think it quite right?"
"You call such
conduct estimable and natural?"
The ‘woman question’?
"Look here,” she
continued, pointing to Colia, “the other day that whippersnapper told
me that this was the whole meaning of the ‘woman question.’ But even
supposing that your mother is a fool, you are none the less, bound to
treat her with humanity."
Why did you come here tonight so insolently?
"‘Give us our rights, but don’t dare to speak in our presence."
"Show us
every mark of deepest respect, while we treat you like the scum of
the earth.’ The miscreants have written a tissue of calumny in their
article, and these are the men who seek for truth, and do battle for the
right!"
"‘We do not beseech, we demand, you will get no thanks from
us, because you will be acting to satisfy your own conscience!’
What morality!"
"But, good heavens!"
"if you declare that the prince’s
generosity will, excite no gratitude in you, he might answer that he is
not, bound to be grateful to Pavlicheff, who also was only satisfying
his own conscience."
"But you counted on the prince’s, gratitude towards
Pavlicheff; you never lent him any money; he owes you nothing; then what
were you counting upon if not on his gratitude?"
"And if you appeal to
that sentiment in others, why should you expect to be exempted from
it?"
They are mad!
"They say society is savage and inhuman because it
despises a young girl who has been seduced."
"But if you call society
inhuman you imply that the young girl is made to suffer by its censure."
"How then, can you hold her up to the scorn of society in the newspapers
without realizing that you are making her suffering, still greater?"
Madmen!
Vain fools!
"They don’t believe in God, they don’t believe in
Christ!"
"But you are so eaten up by pride and vanity, that you will end
by devouring each other--that is my prophecy!"
Is not this absurd?
"Is it
not monstrous chaos?"
"And after all this, that shameless creature will
go and beg their pardon!"
Are there many people like you?
"What are
you smiling at?"
"Because I am not ashamed to disgrace myself before
you?--Yes, I am disgraced--it can’t be helped now!"
"But don’t you jeer at
me, you scum!” (this was aimed at Hippolyte)."
"“He is almost at his last
gasp, yet he corrupts others."
"You have got hold of this lad--” (she
pointed to Colia); “you, have turned his head, you have taught him to
be an atheist, you don’t believe in God, and you are not too old to be
whipped, sir!"
A plague upon you!
"And so, Prince Lef Nicolaievitch,
you will call on them tomorrow, will you?” she asked the prince
breathlessly, for the second time."
"“Yes.”

“Then I will never speak to you again.” She made a sudden movement to
go, and then turned quickly back."
"“And you will call on that atheist?”
 she continued, pointing to Hippolyte."
"“How dare you grin at me like
that?” she shouted furiously, rushing at the invalid, whose mocking
smile drove her to distraction."
Exclamations arose on all sides.
“Lizabetha Prokofievna!
Lizabetha Prokofievna!
"Lizabetha Prokofievna!”

“Mother, this is disgraceful!” cried Aglaya."
"Mrs. Epanchin had approached Hippolyte and seized him firmly by the arm,
while her eyes, blazing with fury, were fixed upon his face."
"“Do not distress yourself, Aglaya Ivanovitch,” he answered calmly; “your
mother knows that one cannot strike a dying man."
"I am ready to explain
why I was laughing."
"I shall be delighted if you will let me--”

A violent fit of coughing, which lasted a full minute, prevented him
from finishing his sentence."
"“He is dying, yet he will not stop holding forth!” cried Lizabetha
Prokofievna."
"She loosed her hold on his arm, almost terrified, as she
saw him wiping the blood from his lips."
“Why do you talk?
"You ought to
go home to bed.”

“So I will,” he whispered hoarsely."
"“As soon as I get home I will go to
bed at once; and I know I shall be dead in a fortnight; Botkine told me
so himself last week."
"That is why I should like to say a few farewell
words, if you will let me.”

“But you must be mad!"
It is ridiculous!
"You should take care of
yourself; what is the use of holding a conversation now?"
"Go home to bed,
do!” cried Mrs. Epanchin in horror."
"“When I do go to bed I shall never get up again,” said Hippolyte, with a
smile."
"“I meant to take to my bed yesterday and stay there till I died,
but as my legs can still carry me, I put it off for two days, so as to
come here with them to-day--but I am very tired.”

“Oh, sit down, sit down, why are you standing?”

Lizabetha Prokofievna placed a chair for him with her own hands."
"“Thank you,” he said gently."
"“Sit opposite to me, and let us talk."
"We
must have a talk now, Lizabetha Prokofievna; I am very anxious for it.”
 He smiled at her once more."
"“Remember that today, for the last time, I
am out in the air, and in the company of my fellow-men, and that in a
fortnight I shall certainly be no longer in this world."
"So, in a way,
this is my farewell to nature and to men."
"I am not very sentimental,
but do you know, I am quite glad that all this has happened at Pavlofsk,
where at least one can see a green tree.”

“But why talk now?” replied Lizabetha Prokofievna, more and more
alarmed; “You are quite feverish."
"Just now you would not stop shouting, and
now you can hardly breathe."
"You are gasping.”

“I shall have time to rest."
Why will you not grant my last wish?
"Do you
know, Lizabetha Prokofievna, that I have dreamed of meeting you for a
long while?"
"I had often heard of you from Colia; he is almost the only
person who still comes to see me."
"You are an original and eccentric
woman; I have seen that for myself--Do you know, I have even been rather
fond of you?”

“Good heavens!"
"And I very nearly struck him!”

“You were prevented by Aglaya Ivanovna."
I think I am not mistaken?
"That
is your daughter, Aglaya Ivanovna?"
"She is so beautiful that I recognized
her directly, although I had never seen her before."
"Let me, at least,
look on beauty for the last time in my life,” he said with a wry smile."
"“You are here with the prince, and your husband, and a large company."
"Why should you refuse to gratify my last wish?”

“Give me a chair!” cried Lizabetha Prokofievna, but she seized one for
herself and sat down opposite to Hippolyte."
"“Colia, you must go home
with him,” she commanded, “and tomorrow I will come my self.”

“Will you let me ask the prince for a cup of tea?..."
I am exhausted.
"Do
you know what you might do, Lizabetha Prokofievna?"
"I think you wanted to
take the prince home with you for tea."
"Stay here, and let us spend
the evening together."
I am sure the prince will give us all some tea.
"Forgive me for being so free and easy--but I know you are kind, and
the prince is kind, too."
"In fact, we are all good-natured people--it is
really quite comical.”

The prince bestirred himself to give orders."
"Lebedeff hurried out,
followed by Vera."
"“It is quite true,” said Mrs. Epanchin decisively."
"“Talk, but not too
loud, and don’t excite yourself."
You have made me sorry for you.
"Prince,
you don’t deserve that I should stay and have tea with you, yet I will,
all the same, but I won’t apologize."
I apologize to nobody!
Nobody!
"It
is absurd!"
"However, forgive me, prince, if I blew you up--that is, if
you like, of course."
"But please don’t let me keep anyone,” she added
suddenly to her husband and daughters, in a tone of resentment, as
though they had grievously offended her."
"“I can come home alone quite
well.”

But they did not let her finish, and gathered round her eagerly."
"The
prince immediately invited everyone to stay for tea, and apologized
for not having thought of it before."
"The general murmured a few polite
words, and asked Lizabetha Prokofievna if she did not feel cold on the
terrace."
"He very nearly asked Hippolyte how long he had been at the
University, but stopped himself in time."
"Evgenie Pavlovitch and Prince
S. suddenly grew extremely gay and amiable."
"Adelaida and Alexandra
had not recovered from their surprise, but it was now mingled with
satisfaction; in short, everyone seemed very much relieved that
Lizabetha Prokofievna had got over her paroxysm."
"Aglaya alone still
frowned, and sat apart in silence."
"All the other guests stayed on as
well; no one wanted to go, not even General Ivolgin, but Lebedeff said
something to him in passing which did not seem to please him, for he
immediately went and sulked in a corner."
"The prince took care to offer
tea to Burdovsky and his friends as well as the rest."
"The invitation
made them rather uncomfortable."
"They muttered that they would wait for
Hippolyte, and went and sat by themselves in a distant corner of the
verandah."
"Tea was served at once; Lebedeff had no doubt ordered it
for himself and his family before the others arrived."
"It was striking
eleven."
X.
"After moistening his lips with the tea which Vera Lebedeff brought him,
Hippolyte set the cup down on the table, and glanced round."
"He seemed
confused and almost at a loss."
"“Just look, Lizabetha Prokofievna,” he began, with a kind of feverish
haste; “these china cups are supposed to be extremely valuable."
"Lebedeff
always keeps them locked up in his china-cupboard; they were part of his
wife’s dowry."
"Yet he has brought them out tonight--in your honour, of
course!"
"He is so pleased--” He was about to add something else, but
could not find the words."
"“There, he is feeling embarrassed; I expected as much,” whispered
Evgenie Pavlovitch suddenly in the prince’s ear."
"“It is a bad sign;
what do you think?"
"Now, out of spite, he will come out with something
so outrageous that even Lizabetha Prokofievna will not be able to stand
it.”

Muishkin looked at him inquiringly."
“You do not care if he does?” added Evgenie Pavlovitch.
"“Neither do I;
in fact, I should be glad, merely as a proper punishment for our dear
Lizabetha Prokofievna."
"I am very anxious that she should get it, without
delay, and I shall stay till she does."
"You seem feverish.”

“Never mind; by-and-by; yes, I am not feeling well,” said the prince
impatiently, hardly listening."
"He had just heard Hippolyte mention his
own name."
"“You don’t believe it?” said the invalid, with a nervous laugh."
"“I don’t
wonder, but the prince will have no difficulty in believing it; he will
not be at all surprised.”

“Do you hear, prince--do you hear that?” said Lizabetha Prokofievna,
turning towards him."
"There was laughter in the group around her, and Lebedeff stood before
her gesticulating wildly."
"“He declares that your humbug of a landlord revised this gentleman’s
article--the article that was read aloud just now--in which you got such
a charming dressing-down.”

The prince regarded Lebedeff with astonishment."
"“Why don’t you say something?” cried Lizabetha Prokofievna, stamping her
foot."
"“Well,” murmured the prince, with his eyes still fixed on Lebedeff, “I
can see now that he did.”

“Is it true?” she asked eagerly."
"“Absolutely, your excellency,” said Lebedeff, without the least
hesitation."
"Mrs. Epanchin almost sprang up in amazement at his answer, and at the
assurance of his tone."
“He actually seems to boast of it!” she cried.
"“I am base--base!” muttered Lebedeff, beating his breast, and hanging
his head."
“What do I care if you are base or not?
"He thinks he has only to say,
‘I am base,’ and there is an end of it."
"As to you, prince, are you not
ashamed?--I repeat, are you not ashamed, to mix with such riff-raff?"
"I
will never forgive you!”

“The prince will forgive me!” said Lebedeff with emotional conviction."
"Keller suddenly left his seat, and approached Lizabetha Prokofievna."
"“It was only out of generosity, madame,” he said in a resonant voice,
“and because I would not betray a friend in an awkward position, that
I did not mention this revision before; though you heard him yourself
threatening to kick us down the steps."
"To clear the matter up, I declare
now that I did have recourse to his assistance, and that I paid him six
roubles for it."
"But I did not ask him to correct my style; I simply went
to him for information concerning the facts, of which I was ignorant
to a great extent, and which he was competent to give."
"The story of the
gaiters, the appetite in the Swiss professor’s house, the substitution
of fifty roubles for two hundred and fifty--all such details, in fact,
were got from him."
"I paid him six roubles for them; but he did not
correct the style.”

“I must state that I only revised the first part of the article,”
 interposed Lebedeff with feverish impatience, while laughter rose from
all around him; “but we fell out in the middle over one idea, so I never
corrected the second part."
"Therefore I cannot be held responsible for
the numerous grammatical blunders in it.”

“That is all he thinks of!” cried Lizabetha Prokofievna."
"“May I ask when this article was revised?” said Evgenie Pavlovitch to
Keller."
"“Yesterday morning,” he replied, “we had an interview which we all gave
our word of honour to keep secret.”

“The very time when he was cringing before you and making protestations
of devotion!"
"Oh, the mean wretches!"
"I will have nothing to do with your
Pushkin, and your daughter shall not set foot in my house!”

Lizabetha Prokofievna was about to rise, when she saw Hippolyte
laughing, and turned upon him with irritation."
"“Well, sir, I suppose you wanted to make me look ridiculous?”

“Heaven forbid!” he answered, with a forced smile."
"“But I am more than
ever struck by your eccentricity, Lizabetha Prokofievna."
"I admit that I
told you of Lebedeff’s duplicity, on purpose."
"I knew the effect it would
have on you,--on you alone, for the prince will forgive him."
"He has
probably forgiven him already, and is racking his brains to find some
excuse for him--is not that the truth, prince?”

He gasped as he spoke, and his strange agitation seemed to increase."
"“Well?” said Mrs. Epanchin angrily, surprised at his tone; “well, what
more?”

“I have heard many things of the kind about you...they delighted me..."
"I
have learned to hold you in the highest esteem,” continued Hippolyte."
"His words seemed tinged with a kind of sarcastic mockery, yet he was
extremely agitated, casting suspicious glances around him, growing
confused, and constantly losing the thread of his ideas."
"All this,
together with his consumptive appearance, and the frenzied expression of
his blazing eyes, naturally attracted the attention of everyone present."
"“I might have been surprised (though I admit I know nothing of the
world), not only that you should have stayed on just now in the company
of such people as myself and my friends, who are not of your class, but
that you should let these... young ladies listen to such a scandalous
affair, though no doubt novel-reading has taught them all there is to
know."
"I may be mistaken; I hardly know what I am saying; but surely
no one but you would have stayed to please a whippersnapper (yes,
a whippersnapper; I admit it) to spend the evening and take part in
everything--only to be ashamed of it tomorrow."
"(I know I express myself
badly.)"
"I admire and appreciate it all extremely, though the expression
on the face of his excellency, your husband, shows that he thinks it
very improper."
"He-he!” He burst out laughing, and was seized with a
fit of coughing which lasted for two minutes and prevented him from
speaking."
"“He has lost his breath now!” said Lizabetha Prokofievna coldly, looking
at him with more curiosity than pity: “Come, my dear boy, that is quite
enough--let us make an end of this.”

Ivan Fedorovitch, now quite out of patience, interrupted suddenly."
"“Let
me remark in my turn, sir,” he said in tones of deep annoyance, “that
my wife is here as the guest of Prince Lef Nicolaievitch, our friend and
neighbour, and that in any case, young man, it is not for you to pass
judgment on the conduct of Lizabetha Prokofievna, or to make remarks
aloud in my presence concerning what feelings you think may be read
in my face."
"Yes, my wife stayed here,” continued the general, with
increasing irritation, “more out of amazement than anything else."
"Everyone can understand that a collection of such strange young men
would attract the attention of a person interested in contemporary life."
"I stayed myself, just as I sometimes stop to look on in the street when
I see something that may be regarded as-as-as-”

“As a curiosity,” suggested Evgenie Pavlovitch, seeing his excellency
involved in a comparison which he could not complete."
"“That is exactly the word I wanted,” said the general with
satisfaction--“a curiosity."
"However, the most astonishing and, if I may
so express myself, the most painful, thing in this matter, is that you
cannot even understand, young man, that Lizabetha Prokofievna, only
stayed with you because you are ill,--if you really are dying--moved
by the pity awakened by your plaintive appeal, and that her
name, character, and social position place her above all risk of
contamination."
"Lizabetha Prokofievna!” he continued, now crimson with
rage, “if you are coming, we will say goodnight to the prince, and--”

“Thank you for the lesson, general,” said Hippolyte, with unexpected
gravity, regarding him thoughtfully."
"“Two minutes more, if you please, dear Ivan Fedorovitch,” said Lizabetha
Prokofievna to her husband; “it seems to me that he is in a fever
and delirious; you can see by his eyes what a state he is in; it is
impossible to let him go back to Petersburg tonight."
"Can you put him
up, Lef Nicolaievitch?"
"I hope you are not bored, dear prince,” she
added suddenly to Prince S. “Alexandra, my dear, come here!"
"Your hair is
coming down.”

She arranged her daughter’s hair, which was not in the least disordered,
and gave her a kiss."
This was all that she had called her for.
"“I thought you were capable of development,” said Hippolyte, coming out
of his fit of abstraction."
"“Yes, that is what I meant to say,” he added,
with the satisfaction of one who suddenly remembers something he had
forgotten."
"“Here is Burdovsky, sincerely anxious to protect his mother;
is not that so?"
And he himself is the cause of her disgrace.
"The prince
is anxious to help Burdovsky and offers him friendship and a large sum
of money, in the sincerity of his heart."
"And here they stand like two
sworn enemies--ha, ha, ha!"
"You all hate Burdovsky because his behaviour
with regard to his mother is shocking and repugnant to you; do you not?"
Is not that true?
Is it not true?
"You all have a passion for beauty and
distinction in outward forms; that is all you care for, isn’t it?"
"I have
suspected for a long time that you cared for nothing else!"
"Well, let me
tell you that perhaps there is not one of you who loved your mother as
Burdovsky loved his."
"As to you, prince, I know that you have sent money
secretly to Burdovsky’s mother through Gania."
"Well, I bet now,” he
continued with an hysterical laugh, “that Burdovsky will accuse you of
indelicacy, and reproach you with a want of respect for his mother!"
"Yes,
that is quite certain!"
"Ha, ha, ha!”

He caught his breath, and began to cough once more."
"“Come, that is enough!"
That is all now; you have no more to say?
"Now
go to bed; you are burning with fever,” said Lizabetha Prokofievna
impatiently."
Her anxious eyes had never left the invalid.
"“Good heavens,
he is going to begin again!”

“You are laughing, I think?"
"Why do you keep laughing at me?” said
Hippolyte irritably to Evgenie Pavlovitch, who certainly was laughing."
"“I only want to know, Mr. Hippolyte--excuse me, I forget your surname.”

“Mr."
"Terentieff,” said the prince."
"“Oh yes, Mr. Terentieff."
Thank you prince.
"I heard it just now, but had
forgotten it."
"I want to know, Mr. Terentieff, if what I have heard about
you is true."
"It seems you are convinced that if you could speak to the
people from a window for a quarter of an hour, you could make them all
adopt your views and follow you?”

“I may have said so,” answered Hippolyte, as if trying to remember."
"“Yes, I certainly said so,” he continued with sudden animation, fixing
an unflinching glance on his questioner."
"“What of it?”

“Nothing."
"I was only seeking further information, to put the finishing
touch.”

Evgenie Pavlovitch was silent, but Hippolyte kept his eyes fixed upon
him, waiting impatiently for more."
"“Well, have you finished?” said Lizabetha Prokofievna to Evgenie."
"“Make
haste, sir; it is time he went to bed."
"Have you more to say?” She was
very angry."
"“Yes, I have a little more,” said Evgenie Pavlovitch, with a smile."
"“It
seems to me that all you and your friends have said, Mr. Terentieff, and
all you have just put forward with such undeniable talent, may be summed
up in the triumph of right above all, independent of everything else, to
the exclusion of everything else; perhaps even before having discovered
what constitutes the right."
"I may be mistaken?”

“You are certainly mistaken; I do not even understand you."
"What else?”

Murmurs arose in the neighbourhood of Burdovsky and his companions;
Lebedeff’s nephew protested under his breath."
"“I have nearly finished,” replied Evgenie Pavlovitch."
"“I will only remark that from these premises one could conclude that
might is right--I mean the right of the clenched fist, and of personal
inclination."
"Indeed, the world has often come to that conclusion."
Prudhon upheld that might is right.
"In the American War some of the most
advanced Liberals took sides with the planters on the score that the
blacks were an inferior race to the whites, and that might was the right
of the white race.”

“Well?”

“You mean, no doubt, that you do not deny that might is right?”

“What then?”

“You are at least logical."
"I would only point out that from the right
of might, to the right of tigers and crocodiles, or even Daniloff and
Gorsky, is but a step.”

“I know nothing about that; what else?”

Hippolyte was scarcely listening."
"He kept saying “well?” and “what else?”
 mechanically, without the least curiosity, and by mere force of habit."
"“Why, nothing else; that is all.”

“However, I bear you no grudge,” said Hippolyte suddenly, and, hardly
conscious of what he was doing, he held out his hand with a smile."
"The
gesture took Evgenie Pavlovitch by surprise, but with the utmost gravity
he touched the hand that was offered him in token of forgiveness."
"“I can but thank you,” he said, in a tone too respectful to be sincere,
“for your kindness in letting me speak, for I have often noticed that
our Liberals never allow other people to have an opinion of their own,
and immediately answer their opponents with abuse, if they do not have
recourse to arguments of a still more unpleasant nature.”

“What you say is quite true,” observed General Epanchin; then, clasping
his hands behind his back, he returned to his place on the terrace
steps, where he yawned with an air of boredom."
"“Come, sir, that will do; you weary me,” said Lizabetha Prokofievna
suddenly to Evgenie Pavlovitch."
"Hippolyte rose all at once, looking troubled and almost frightened."
"“It is time for me to go,” he said, glancing round in perplexity."
"“I
have detained you..."
I wanted to tell you everything...
"I thought you
all... for the last time... it was a whim...”

He evidently had sudden fits of returning animation, when he awoke
from his semi-delirium; then, recovering full self-possession for a
few moments, he would speak, in disconnected phrases which had perhaps
haunted him for a long while on his bed of suffering, during weary,
sleepless nights."
"“Well, good-bye,” he said abruptly."
"“You think it is easy for me to say
good-bye to you?"
"Ha, ha!”

Feeling that his question was somewhat gauche, he smiled angrily."
"Then
as if vexed that he could not ever express what he really meant, he said
irritably, in a loud voice:

“Excellency, I have the honour of inviting you to my funeral; that is,
if you will deign to honour it with your presence."
"I invite you all,
gentlemen, as well as the general.”

He burst out laughing again, but it was the laughter of a madman."
Lizabetha Prokofievna approached him anxiously and seized his arm.
"He stared at her for a moment, still laughing, but soon his face grew
serious."
"“Do you know that I came here to see those trees?” pointing to the
trees in the park."
"“It is not ridiculous, is it?"
"Say that it is not
ridiculous!” he demanded urgently of Lizabetha Prokofievna."
"Then he
seemed to be plunged in thought."
"A moment later he raised his head, and
his eyes sought for someone."
"He was looking for Evgenie Pavlovitch, who
was close by on his right as before, but he had forgotten this, and
his eyes ranged over the assembled company."
“Ah!
"you have not gone!” he
said, when he caught sight of him at last."
"“You kept on laughing just
now, because I thought of speaking to the people from the window for a
quarter of an hour."
"But I am not eighteen, you know; lying on that bed,
and looking out of that window, I have thought of all sorts of things
for such a long time that... a dead man has no age, you know."
"I was
saying that to myself only last week, when I was awake in the night."
"Do
you know what you fear most?"
"You fear our sincerity more than anything,
although you despise us!"
"The idea crossed my mind that night... You
thought I was making fun of you just now, Lizabetha Prokofievna?"
"No, the
idea of mockery was far from me; I only meant to praise you."
"Colia
told me the prince called you a child--very well--but let me see, I had
something else to say...” He covered his face with his hands and tried
to collect his thoughts."
"“Ah, yes--you were going away just now, and I thought to myself: ‘I
shall never see these people again--never again!"
"This is the last time
I shall see the trees, too."
"I shall see nothing after this but the red
brick wall of Meyer’s house opposite my window."
"Tell them about it--try
to tell them,’ I thought."
"‘Here is a beautiful young girl--you are a
dead man; make them understand that."
"Tell them that a dead man may
say anything--and Mrs. Grundy will not be angry--ha-ha!"
"You are not
laughing?” He looked anxiously around."
"“But you know I get so many queer
ideas, lying there in bed."
"I have grown convinced that nature is full of
mockery--you called me an atheist just now, but you know this nature...
why are you laughing again?"
"You are very cruel!” he added suddenly,
regarding them all with mournful reproach."
"“I have not corrupted Colia,”
 he concluded in a different and very serious tone, as if remembering
something again."
“Nobody here is laughing at you.
"Calm yourself,” said Lizabetha
Prokofievna, much moved."
"“You shall see a new doctor tomorrow; the
other was mistaken; but sit down, do not stand like that!"
"You are
delirious--” Oh, what shall we do with him she cried in anguish, as she
made him sit down again in the arm-chair."
A tear glistened on her cheek.
"At the sight of it Hippolyte seemed
amazed."
"He lifted his hand timidly and, touched the tear with his
finger, smiling like a child."
"“I... you,” he began joyfully."
"“You cannot tell how I... he always spoke
so enthusiastically of you, Colia here; I liked his enthusiasm."
"I was
not corrupting him!"
"But I must leave him, too--I wanted to leave
them all--there was not one of them--not one!"
"I wanted to be a man of
action--I had a right to be."
Oh!
what a lot of things I wanted!
"Now I
want nothing; I renounce all my wants; I swore to myself that I would
want nothing; let them seek the truth without me!"
"Yes, nature is full
of mockery!"
"Why”--he continued with sudden warmth--“does she create
the choicest beings only to mock at them?"
"The only human being who is
recognized as perfect, when nature showed him to mankind, was given the
mission to say things which have caused the shedding of so much blood
that it would have drowned mankind if it had all been shed at once!"
Oh!
it is better for me to die!
"I should tell some dreadful lie too; nature
would so contrive it!"
I have corrupted nobody.
"I wanted to live for the
happiness of all men, to find and spread the truth."
"I used to look out
of my window at the wall of Meyer’s house, and say to myself that if I
could speak for a quarter of an hour I would convince the whole world,
and now for once in my life I have come into contact with... you--if
not with the others!"
And what is the result?
Nothing!
"The sole result
is that you despise me!"
"Therefore I must be a fool, I am useless, it is
time I disappeared!"
And I shall leave not even a memory!
"Not a sound,
not a trace, not a single deed!"
I have not spread a single truth!...
"Do
not laugh at the fool!"
Forget him!
Forget him forever!
"I beseech you,
do not be so cruel as to remember!"
"Do you know that if I were not
consumptive, I would kill myself?”

Though he seemed to wish to say much more, he became silent."
"He fell
back into his chair, and, covering his face with his hands, began to sob
like a little child."
“Oh!
what on earth are we to do with him?” cried Lizabetha Prokofievna.
"She hastened to him and pressed his head against her bosom, while he
sobbed convulsively."
"“Come, come, come!"
"There, you must not cry, that will do."
"You are a good
child!"
"God will forgive you, because you knew no better."
"Come now, be a
man!"
"You know presently you will be ashamed.”

Hippolyte raised his head with an effort, saying:

“I have little brothers and sisters, over there, poor avid innocent."
"She
will corrupt them!"
You are a saint!
You are a child yourself--save them!
Snatch them from that... she is... it is shameful!
Oh!
help them!
"God
will repay you a hundredfold."
"For the love of God, for the love of
Christ!”

“Speak, Ivan Fedorovitch!"
"What are we to do?” cried Lizabetha
Prokofievna, irritably."
“Please break your majestic silence!
"I tell you,
if you cannot come to some decision, I will stay here all night myself."
"You have tyrannized over me enough, you autocrat!”

She spoke angrily, and in great excitement, and expected an immediate
reply."
"But in such a case, no matter how many are present, all prefer
to keep silence: no one will take the initiative, but all reserve their
comments till afterwards."
"There were some present--Varvara Ardalionovna,
for instance--who would have willingly sat there till morning without
saying a word."
"Varvara had sat apart all the evening without opening her
lips, but she listened to everything with the closest attention; perhaps
she had her reasons for so doing."
"“My dear,” said the general, “it seems to me that a sick-nurse would be
of more use here than an excitable person like you."
"Perhaps it would be
as well to get some sober, reliable man for the night."
"In any case we
must consult the prince, and leave the patient to rest at once."
"Tomorrow
we can see what can be done for him.”

“It is nearly midnight; we are going."
"Will he come with us, or is he to
stay here?” Doktorenko asked crossly of the prince."
"“You can stay with him if you like,” said Muishkin."
"“There is plenty of room here.”

Suddenly, to the astonishment of all, Keller went quickly up to the
general."
"“Excellency,” he said, impulsively, “if you want a reliable man for the
night, I am ready to sacrifice myself for my friend--such a soul as he
has!"
"I have long thought him a great man, excellency!"
"My article showed
my lack of education, but when he criticizes he scatters pearls!”

Ivan Fedorovitch turned from the boxer with a gesture of despair."
"“I shall be delighted if he will stay; it would certainly be difficult
for him to get back to Petersburg,” said the prince, in answer to the
eager questions of Lizabetha Prokofievna."
"“But you are half asleep, are you not?"
"If you don’t want him, I will
take him back to my house!"
"Why, good gracious!"
"He can hardly stand up
himself!"
What is it?
"Are you ill?”

Not finding the prince on his death-bed, Lizabetha Prokofievna had been
misled by his appearance to think him much better than he was."
"But his
recent illness, the painful memories attached to it, the fatigue of this
evening, the incident with “Pavlicheff’s son,” and now this scene with
Hippolyte, had all so worked on his oversensitive nature that he was now
almost in a fever."
"Moreover, a new trouble, almost a fear, showed itself
in his eyes; he watched Hippolyte anxiously as if expecting something
further."
Suddenly Hippolyte arose.
"His face, shockingly pale, was that of a man
overwhelmed with shame and despair."
"This was shown chiefly in the look
of fear and hatred which he cast upon the assembled company, and in the
wild smile upon his trembling lips."
"Then he cast down his eyes, and with
the same smile, staggered towards Burdovsky and Doktorenko, who stood at
the entrance to the verandah."
He had decided to go with them.
“There!
that is what I feared!” cried the prince.
"“It was inevitable!”

Hippolyte turned upon him, a prey to maniacal rage, which set all the
muscles of his face quivering."
“Ah!
that is what you feared!
"It was inevitable, you say!"
"Well, let me
tell you that if I hate anyone here--I hate you all,” he cried, in a
hoarse, strained voice--“but you, you, with your jesuitical soul, your
soul of sickly sweetness, idiot, beneficent millionaire--I hate you
worse than anything or anyone on earth!"
"I saw through you and hated you
long ago; from the day I first heard of you."
"I hated you with my whole
heart."
You have contrived all this!
You have driven me into this state!
You have made a dying man disgrace himself.
"You, you, you are the cause
of my abject cowardice!"
I would kill you if I remained alive!
"I do not
want your benefits; I will accept none from anyone; do you hear?"
"Not
from any one!"
I want nothing!
"I was delirious, do not dare to triumph!"
"I
curse every one of you, once for all!”

Breath failed him here, and he was obliged to stop."
"“He is ashamed of his tears!” whispered Lebedeff to Lizabetha
Prokofievna."
“It was inevitable.
Ah!
what a wonderful man the prince is!
"He read his very soul.”

But Mrs. Epanchin would not deign to look at Lebedeff."
"Drawn up
haughtily, with her head held high, she gazed at the “riff-raff,”
 with scornful curiosity."
"When Hippolyte had finished, Ivan Fedorovitch
shrugged his shoulders, and his wife looked him angrily up and down, as
if to demand the meaning of his movement."
Then she turned to the prince.
"“Thanks, prince, many thanks, eccentric friend of the family, for the
pleasant evening you have provided for us."
"I am sure you are quite
pleased that you have managed to mix us up with your extraordinary
affairs."
"It is quite enough, dear family friend; thank you for giving us
an opportunity of getting to know you so well.”

She arranged her cloak with hands that trembled with anger as she waited
for the “riff-raff” to go."
"The cab which Lebedeff’s son had gone to
fetch a quarter of an hour ago, by Doktorenko’s order, arrived at that
moment."
The general thought fit to put in a word after his wife.
"“Really, prince, I hardly expected after--after all our friendly
intercourse--and you see, Lizabetha Prokofievna--”

“Papa, how can you?” cried Adelaida, walking quickly up to the prince
and holding out her hand."
"He smiled absently at her; then suddenly he felt a burning sensation in
his ear as an angry voice whispered:

“If you do not turn those dreadful people out of the house this very
instant, I shall hate you all my life--all my life!” It was Aglaya."
"She
seemed almost in a frenzy, but she turned away before the prince could
look at her."
"However, there was no one left to turn out of the house,
for they had managed meanwhile to get Hippolyte into the cab, and it had
driven off."
"“Well, how much longer is this going to last, Ivan Fedorovitch?"
"What do
you think?"
"Shall I soon be delivered from these odious youths?”

“My dear, I am quite ready; naturally... the prince.”

Ivan Fedorovitch held out his hand to Muishkin, but ran after his wife,
who was leaving with every sign of violent indignation, before he had
time to shake it."
"Adelaida, her fiance, and Alexandra, said good-bye to
their host with sincere friendliness."
"Evgenie Pavlovitch did the same,
and he alone seemed in good spirits."
“What I expected has happened!
"But I am sorry, you poor fellow, that
you should have had to suffer for it,” he murmured, with a most charming
smile."
Aglaya left without saying good-bye.
"But the evening was not to end
without a last adventure."
"An unexpected meeting was yet in store for
Lizabetha Prokofievna."
"She had scarcely descended the terrace steps leading to the high road
that skirts the park at Pavlofsk, when suddenly there dashed by a smart
open carriage, drawn by a pair of beautiful white horses."
"Having passed
some ten yards beyond the house, the carriage suddenly drew up, and one
of the two ladies seated in it turned sharp round as though she had just
caught sight of some acquaintance whom she particularly wished to see."
“Evgenie Pavlovitch!
"Is that you?” cried a clear, sweet voice, which
caused the prince, and perhaps someone else, to tremble."
"“Well, I _am_
glad I’ve found you at last!"
"I’ve sent to town for you twice today
myself!"
"My messengers have been searching for you everywhere!”

Evgenie Pavlovitch stood on the steps like one struck by lightning."
"Mrs. Epanchin stood still too, but not with the petrified expression of
Evgenie."
"She gazed haughtily at the audacious person who had addressed
her companion, and then turned a look of astonishment upon Evgenie
himself."
“There’s news!” continued the clear voice.
"“You need not be anxious
about Kupferof’s IOU’s--Rogojin has bought them up."
"I persuaded him
to!--I dare say we shall settle Biscup too, so it’s all right, you
see!"
"_Au revoir_, tomorrow!"
"And don’t worry!” The carriage moved on, and
disappeared."
"“The woman’s mad!” cried Evgenie, at last, crimson with anger, and
looking confusedly around."
“I don’t know what she’s talking about!
"What
IOU’s?"
"Who is she?” Mrs. Epanchin continued to watch his face for a
couple of seconds; then she marched briskly and haughtily away towards
her own house, the rest following her."
"A minute afterwards, Evgenie Pavlovitch reappeared on the terrace, in
great agitation."
"“Prince,” he said, “tell me the truth; do you know what all this means?”

“I know nothing whatever about it!” replied the latter, who was,
himself, in a state of nervous excitement."
"“No?”

“No!”

“Well, nor do I!” said Evgenie Pavlovitch, laughing suddenly."
"“I haven’t
the slightest knowledge of any such IOU’s as she mentioned, I swear I
haven’t--What’s the matter, are you fainting?”

“Oh, no--no--I’m all right, I assure you!”

XI."
The anger of the Epanchin family was unappeased for three days.
"As usual
the prince reproached himself, and had expected punishment, but he was
inwardly convinced that Lizabetha Prokofievna could not be seriously
angry with him, and that she probably was more angry with herself."
"He
was painfully surprised, therefore, when three days passed with no word
from her."
"Other things also troubled and perplexed him, and one of these
grew more important in his eyes as the days went by."
"He had begun to
blame himself for two opposite tendencies--on the one hand to extreme,
almost “senseless,” confidence in his fellows, on the other to a “vile,
gloomy suspiciousness.”

By the end of the third day the incident of the eccentric lady and
Evgenie Pavlovitch had attained enormous and mysterious proportions in
his mind."
"He sorrowfully asked himself whether he had been the cause of
this new “monstrosity,” or was it... but he refrained from saying who
else might be in fault."
"As for the letters N.P.B., he looked on that as
a harmless joke, a mere childish piece of mischief--so childish that
he felt it would be shameful, almost dishonourable, to attach any
importance to it."
"The day after these scandalous events, however, the prince had the
honour of receiving a visit from Adelaida and her fiance, Prince S. They
came, ostensibly, to inquire after his health."
"They had wandered out for
a walk, and called in “by accident,” and talked for almost the whole
of the time they were with him about a certain most lovely tree in the
park, which Adelaida had set her heart upon for a picture."
"This, and a
little amiable conversation on Prince S.’s part, occupied the time, and
not a word was said about last evening’s episodes."
"At length Adelaida
burst out laughing, apologized, and explained that they had come
incognito; from which, and from the circumstance that they said nothing
about the prince’s either walking back with them or coming to see them
later on, the latter inferred that he was in Mrs. Epanchin’s black
books."
"Adelaida mentioned a watercolour that she would much like to show
him, and explained that she would either send it by Colia, or bring it
herself the next day--which to the prince seemed very suggestive."
"At length, however, just as the visitors were on the point of departing,
Prince S. seemed suddenly to recollect himself."
"“Oh yes, by-the-by,” he
said, “do you happen to know, my dear Lef Nicolaievitch, who that lady
was who called out to Evgenie Pavlovitch last night, from the carriage?”

“It was Nastasia Philipovna,” said the prince; “didn’t you know that?"
"I
cannot tell you who her companion was.”

“But what on earth did she mean?"
"I assure you it is a real riddle
to me--to me, and to others, too!” Prince S. seemed to be under the
influence of sincere astonishment."
"“She spoke of some bills of Evgenie Pavlovitch’s,” said the prince,
simply, “which Rogojin had bought up from someone; and implied that
Rogojin would not press him.”

“Oh, I heard that much, my dear fellow!"
"But the thing is so impossibly
absurd!"
"A man of property like Evgenie to give IOU’s to a money-lender,
and to be worried about them!"
It is ridiculous.
"Besides, he cannot
possibly be on such intimate terms with Nastasia Philipovna as she gave
us to understand; that’s the principal part of the mystery!"
"He has given
me his word that he knows nothing whatever about the matter, and of
course I believe him."
"Well, the question is, my dear prince, do you know
anything about it?"
"Has any sort of suspicion of the meaning of it come
across you?”

“No, I know nothing whatever about it."
"I assure you I had nothing at all
to do with it.”

“Oh, prince, how strange you have become!"
"I assure you, I hardly know
you for your old self."
"How can you suppose that I ever suggested you
could have had a finger in such a business?"
"But you are not quite
yourself today, I can see.” He embraced the prince, and kissed him."
"“What do you mean, though,” asked Muishkin, “‘by such a business’?"
"I
don’t see any particular ‘business’ about it at all!”

“Oh, undoubtedly, this person wished somehow, and for some reason, to
do Evgenie Pavlovitch a bad turn, by attributing to him--before
witnesses--qualities which he neither has nor can have,” replied Prince
S. drily enough."
"Muiskhin looked disturbed, but continued to gaze intently and
questioningly into Prince S.’s face."
"The latter, however, remained
silent."
"“Then it was not simply a matter of bills?” Muishkin said at last, with
some impatience."
"“It was not as she said?”

“But I ask you, my dear sir, how can there be anything in common between
Evgenie Pavlovitch, and--her, and again Rogojin?"
"I tell you he is a man
of immense wealth--as I know for a fact; and he has further expectations
from his uncle."
"Simply Nastasia Philipovna--”

Prince S. paused, as though unwilling to continue talking about Nastasia
Philipovna."
"“Then at all events he knows her!” remarked the prince, after a moment’s
silence."
"“Oh, that may be."
"He may have known her some time ago--two or three
years, at least."
He used to know Totski.
"But it is impossible that
there should be any intimacy between them."
"She has not even been in the
place--many people don’t even know that she has returned from Moscow!"
"I
have only observed her carriage about for the last three days or so.”

“It’s a lovely carriage,” said Adelaida."
"“Yes, it was a beautiful turn-out, certainly!”

The visitors left the house, however, on no less friendly terms than
before."
"But the visit was of the greatest importance to the prince, from
his own point of view."
"Admitting that he had his suspicions, from
the moment of the occurrence of last night, perhaps even before, that
Nastasia had some mysterious end in view, yet this visit confirmed his
suspicions and justified his fears."
"It was all clear to him; Prince S.
was wrong, perhaps, in his view of the matter, but he was somewhere near
the truth, and was right in so far as that he understood there to be
an intrigue of some sort going on."
"Perhaps Prince S. saw it all more
clearly than he had allowed his hearers to understand."
"At all events,
nothing could be plainer than that he and Adelaida had come for the
express purpose of obtaining explanations, and that they suspected him
of being concerned in the affair."
"And if all this were so, then _she_ must
have some terrible object in view!"
What was it?
"There was no stopping
_her_, as Muishkin knew from experience, in the performance of anything
she had set her mind on!"
"“Oh, she is mad, mad!” thought the poor prince."
"But there were many other puzzling occurrences that day, which required
immediate explanation, and the prince felt very sad."
"A visit from Vera
Lebedeff distracted him a little."
"She brought the infant Lubotchka with
her as usual, and talked cheerfully for some time."
"Then came her younger
sister, and later the brother, who attended a school close by."
"He
informed Muishkin that his father had lately found a new interpretation
of the star called “wormwood,” which fell upon the water-springs, as
described in the Apocalypse."
"He had decided that it meant the network of
railroads spread over the face of Europe at the present time."
"The
prince refused to believe that Lebedeff could have given such an
interpretation, and they decided to ask him about it at the earliest
opportunity."
"Vera related how Keller had taken up his abode with them on
the previous evening."
"She thought he would remain for some time, as he
was greatly pleased with the society of General Ivolgin and of the
whole family."
"But he declared that he had only come to them in order
to complete his education!"
"The prince always enjoyed the company of
Lebedeff’s children, and today it was especially welcome, for Colia did
not appear all day."
Early that morning he had started for Petersburg.
Lebedeff also was away on business.
"But Gavrila Ardalionovitch had
promised to visit Muishkin, who eagerly awaited his coming."
"About seven in the evening, soon after dinner, he arrived."
"At the first
glance it struck the prince that he, at any rate, must know all the
details of last night’s affair."
"Indeed, it would have been impossible
for him to remain in ignorance considering the intimate relationship
between him, Varvara Ardalionovna, and Ptitsin."
"But although he and the
prince were intimate, in a sense, and although the latter had placed
the Burdovsky affair in his hands--and this was not the only mark of
confidence he had received--it seemed curious how many matters there
were that were tacitly avoided in their conversations."
"Muishkin thought
that Gania at times appeared to desire more cordiality and frankness."
"It was apparent now, when he entered, that he was convinced that the
moment for breaking the ice between them had come at last."
"But all the same Gania was in haste, for his sister was waiting at
Lebedeff’s to consult him on an urgent matter of business."
"If he had
anticipated impatient questions, or impulsive confidences, he was
soon undeceived."
"The prince was thoughtful, reserved, even a little
absent-minded, and asked none of the questions--one in particular--that
Gania had expected."
"So he imitated the prince’s demeanour, and talked
fast and brilliantly upon all subjects but the one on which their
thoughts were engaged."
"Among other things Gania told his host that
Nastasia Philipovna had been only four days in Pavlofsk, and that
everyone was talking about her already."
"She was staying with Daria
Alexeyevna, in an ugly little house in Mattrossky Street, but drove
about in the smartest carriage in the place."
"A crowd of followers
had pursued her from the first, young and old."
"Some escorted her on
horse-back when she took the air in her carriage."
"She was as capricious as ever in the choice of her acquaintances, and
admitted few into her narrow circle."
"Yet she already had a numerous
following and many champions on whom she could depend in time of need."
"One gentleman on his holiday had broken off his engagement on her
account, and an old general had quarrelled with his only son for the
same reason."
"She was accompanied sometimes in her carriage by a girl of sixteen,
a distant relative of her hostess."
"This young lady sang very well; in
fact, her music had given a kind of notoriety to their little house."
"Nastasia, however, was behaving with great discretion on the whole."
"She
dressed quietly, though with such taste as to drive all the ladies
in Pavlofsk mad with envy, of that, as well as of her beauty and her
carriage and horses."
"“As for yesterday’s episode,” continued Gania, “of course it was
pre-arranged.” Here he paused, as though expecting to be asked how
he knew that."
But the prince did not inquire.
"Concerning Evgenie
Pavlovitch, Gania stated, without being asked, that he believed the
former had not known Nastasia Philipovna in past years, but that he had
probably been introduced to her by somebody in the park during these
four days."
"As to the question of the IOU’s she had spoken of, there
might easily be something in that; for though Evgenie was undoubtedly
a man of wealth, yet certain of his affairs were equally undoubtedly in
disorder."
"Arrived at this interesting point, Gania suddenly broke off,
and said no more about Nastasia’s prank of the previous evening."
"At last Varvara Ardalionovna came in search of her brother, and remained
for a few minutes."
"Without Muishkin’s asking her, she informed him that
Evgenie Pavlovitch was spending the day in Petersburg, and perhaps would
remain there over tomorrow; and that her husband had also gone to town,
probably in connection with Evgenie Pavlovitch’s affairs."
"“Lizabetha Prokofievna is in a really fiendish temper today,” she
added, as she went out, “but the most curious thing is that Aglaya has
quarrelled with her whole family; not only with her father and mother,
but with her sisters also."
"It is not a good sign.” She said all this
quite casually, though it was extremely important in the eyes of
the prince, and went off with her brother."
"Regarding the episode of
“Pavlicheff’s son,” Gania had been absolutely silent, partly from a kind
of false modesty, partly, perhaps, to “spare the prince’s feelings.” The
latter, however, thanked him again for the trouble he had taken in the
affair."
Muishkin was glad enough to be left alone.
"He went out of the garden,
crossed the road, and entered the park."
"He wished to reflect, and to
make up his mind as to a certain “step.” This step was one of those
things, however, which are not thought out, as a rule, but decided for
or against hastily, and without much reflection."
"The fact is, he felt a
longing to leave all this and go away--go anywhere, if only it were
far enough, and at once, without bidding farewell to anyone."
"He felt a
presentiment that if he remained but a few days more in this place, and
among these people, he would be fixed there irrevocably and permanently."
"However, in a very few minutes he decided that to run away was
impossible; that it would be cowardly; that great problems lay before
him, and that he had no right to leave them unsolved, or at least to
refuse to give all his energy and strength to the attempt to solve them."
"Having come to this determination, he turned and went home, his walk
having lasted less than a quarter of an hour."
"At that moment he was
thoroughly unhappy."
"Lebedeff had not returned, so towards evening Keller managed to
penetrate into the prince’s apartments."
"He was not drunk, but in a
confidential and talkative mood."
"He announced that he had come to tell
the story of his life to Muishkin, and had only remained at Pavlofsk for
that purpose."
"There was no means of turning him out; nothing short of an
earthquake would have removed him."
"In the manner of one with long hours before him, he began his history;
but after a few incoherent words he jumped to the conclusion, which
was that “having ceased to believe in God Almighty, he had lost every
vestige of morality, and had gone so far as to commit a theft.” “Could
you imagine such a thing?” said he."
"“Listen to me, Keller,” returned the prince."
"“If I were in your place, I
should not acknowledge that unless it were absolutely necessary for some
reason."
"But perhaps you are making yourself out to be worse than you
are, purposely?”

“I should tell it to no one but yourself, prince, and I only name it now
as a help to my soul’s evolution."
"When I die, that secret will die with
me!"
"But, excellency, if you knew, if you only had the least idea, how
difficult it is to get money nowadays!"
Where to find it is the question.
"Ask for a loan, the answer is always the same: ‘Give us gold, jewels, or
diamonds, and it will be quite easy.’ Exactly what one has not got!"
"Can
you picture that to yourself?"
"I got angry at last, and said, ‘I
suppose you would accept emeralds?’ ‘Certainly, we accept emeralds with
pleasure."
"Yes!’ ‘Well, that’s all right,’ said I."
"‘Go to the devil, you
den of thieves!’ And with that I seized my hat, and walked out.”

“Had you any emeralds?” asked the prince."
“What?
I have emeralds?
"Oh, prince!"
"with what simplicity, with what
almost pastoral simplicity, you look upon life!”

Could not something be made of this man under good influences?"
"asked the
prince of himself, for he began to feel a kind of pity for his visitor."
"He thought little of the value of his own personal influence, not from
a sense of humility, but from his peculiar way of looking at things
in general."
"Imperceptibly the conversation grew more animated and more
interesting, so that neither of the two felt anxious to bring it to a
close."
"Keller confessed, with apparent sincerity, to having been guilty
of many acts of such a nature that it astonished the prince that he
could mention them, even to him."
"At every fresh avowal he professed the
deepest repentance, and described himself as being “bathed in tears”;
but this did not prevent him from putting on a boastful air at times,
and some of his stories were so absurdly comical that both he and the
prince laughed like madmen."
"“One point in your favour is that you seem to have a child-like mind,
and extreme truthfulness,” said the prince at last."
"“Do you know that
that atones for much?”

“I am assuredly noble-minded, and chivalrous to a degree!” said Keller,
much softened."
"“But, do you know, this nobility of mind exists in a
dream, if one may put it so?"
It never appears in practice or deed.
"Now,
why is that?"
"I can never understand.”

“Do not despair."
"I think we may say without fear of deceiving ourselves,
that you have now given a fairly exact account of your life."
"I, at
least, think it would be impossible to add much to what you have just
told me.”

“Impossible?” cried Keller, almost pityingly."
"“Oh prince, how little you
really seem to understand human nature!”

“Is there really much more to be added?” asked the prince, with mild
surprise."
"“Well, what is it you really want of me?"
"Speak out; tell me
why you came to make your confession to me?”

“What did I want?"
"Well, to begin with, it is good to meet a man like
you."
It is a pleasure to talk over my faults with you.
"I know you for
one of the best of men... and then... then...”

He hesitated, and appeared so much embarrassed that the prince helped
him out."
"“Then you wanted me to lend you money?”

The words were spoken in a grave tone, and even somewhat shyly."
"Keller started, gave an astonished look at the speaker, and thumped the
table with his fist."
"“Well, prince, that’s enough to knock me down!"
It astounds me!
"Here you
are, as simple and innocent as a knight of the golden age, and yet...
yet... you read a man’s soul like a psychologist!"
"Now, do explain it to
me, prince, because I..."
I really do not understand!...
"Of course, my
aim was to borrow money all along, and you... you asked the question
as if there was nothing blameable in it--as if you thought it quite
natural.”

“Yes... from you it is quite natural.”

“And you are not offended?”

“Why should I be offended?”

“Well, just listen, prince."
"I remained here last evening, partly because
I have a great admiration for the French archbishop Bourdaloue."
"I
enjoyed a discussion over him till three o’clock in the morning, with
Lebedeff; and then... then--I swear by all I hold sacred that I am
telling you the truth--then I wished to develop my soul in this frank
and heartfelt confession to you."
"This was my thought as I was sobbing
myself to sleep at dawn."
"Just as I was losing consciousness, tears in
my soul, tears on my face (I remember how I lay there sobbing), an idea
from hell struck me."
"‘Why not, after confessing, borrow money from him?’
You see, this confession was a kind of masterstroke; I intended to use
it as a means to your good grace and favour--and then--then I meant to
walk off with a hundred and fifty roubles."
"Now, do you not call that
base?”

“It is hardly an exact statement of the case,” said the prince in reply."
"“You have confused your motives and ideas, as I need scarcely say too
often happens to myself."
"I can assure you, Keller, I reproach myself
bitterly for it sometimes."
"When you were talking just now I seemed to be
listening to something about myself."
"At times I have imagined that all
men were the same,” he continued earnestly, for he appeared to be much
interested in the conversation, “and that consoled me in a certain
degree, for a _double_ motive is a thing most difficult to fight against."
"I have tried, and I know."
"God knows whence they arise, these ideas that
you speak of as base."
"I fear these double motives more than ever just
now, but I am not your judge, and in my opinion it is going too far to
give the name of baseness to it--what do you think?"
"You were going
to employ your tears as a ruse in order to borrow money, but you also
say--in fact, you have sworn to the fact--that independently of this
your confession was made with an honourable motive."
"As for the money,
you want it for drink, do you not?"
"After your confession, that is
weakness, of course; but, after all, how can anyone give up a bad habit
at a moment’s notice?"
It is impossible.
What can we do?
"It is best, I
think, to leave the matter to your own conscience."
"How does it seem to
you?” As he concluded the prince looked curiously at Keller; evidently
this problem of double motives had often been considered by him before."
"“Well, how anybody can call you an idiot after that, is more than I can
understand!” cried the boxer."
The prince reddened slightly.
"“Bourdaloue, the archbishop, would not have spared a man like me,”
 Keller continued, “but you, you have judged me with humanity."
"To show
how grateful I am, and as a punishment, I will not accept a hundred and
fifty roubles."
"Give me twenty-five--that will be enough; it is all I
really need, for a fortnight at least."
"I will not ask you for more for
a fortnight."
"I should like to have given Agatha a present, but she does
not really deserve it."
"Oh, my dear prince, God bless you!”

At this moment Lebedeff appeared, having just arrived from Petersburg."
"He frowned when he saw the twenty-five rouble note in Keller’s hand, but
the latter, having got the money, went away at once."
"Lebedeff began to
abuse him."
"“You are unjust; I found him sincerely repentant,” observed the prince,
after listening for a time."
“What is the good of repentance like that?
"It is the same exactly as
mine yesterday, when I said, ‘I am base, I am base,’--words, and nothing
more!”

“Then they were only words on your part?"
"I thought, on the contrary...”

“Well, I don’t mind telling you the truth--you only!"
"Because you see
through a man somehow."
"Words and actions, truth and falsehood, are all
jumbled up together in me, and yet I am perfectly sincere."
"I feel the
deepest repentance, believe it or not, as you choose; but words and lies
come out in the infernal craving to get the better of other people."
"It is always there--the notion of cheating people, and of using my
repentant tears to my own advantage!"
"I assure you this is the truth,
prince!"
I would not tell any other man for the world!
"He would laugh and
jeer at me--but you, you judge a man humanely.”

“Why, Keller said the same thing to me nearly word for word a few
minutes ago!” cried Muishkin."
"“And you both seem inclined to boast about
it!"
"You astonish me, but I think he is more sincere than you, for you
make a regular trade of it."
"Oh, don’t put on that pathetic expression,
and don’t put your hand on your heart!"
Have you anything to say to me?
"You have not come for nothing...”

Lebedeff grinned and wriggled."
"“I have been waiting all day for you, because I want to ask you a
question; and, for once in your life, please tell me the truth at once."
"Had you anything to do with that affair of the carriage yesterday?”

Lebedeff began to grin again, rubbed his hands, sneezed, but spoke not a
word in reply."
"“I see you had something to do with it.”

“Indirectly, quite indirectly!"
I am speaking the truth--I am indeed!
"I merely told a certain person that I had people in my house, and that
such and such personages might be found among them.”

“I am aware that you sent your son to that house--he told me so himself
just now, but what is this intrigue?” said the prince, impatiently."
"“It is not my intrigue!” cried Lebedeff, waving his hand."
"“It was engineered by other people, and is, properly speaking, rather a
fantasy than an intrigue!”

“But what is it all about?"
"Tell me, for Heaven’s sake!"
"Cannot you
understand how nearly it touches me?"
"Why are they blackening Evgenie
Pavlovitch’s reputation?”

Lebedeff grimaced and wriggled again."
“Prince!” said he.
“Excellency!
"You won’t let me tell you the whole
truth; I have tried to explain; more than once I have begun, but you
have not allowed me to go on...”

The prince gave no answer, and sat deep in thought."
"Evidently he was
struggling to decide."
“Very well!
"Tell me the truth,” he said, dejectedly."
"“Aglaya Ivanovna...” began Lebedeff, promptly."
“Be silent!
"At once!” interrupted the prince, red with indignation, and
perhaps with shame, too."
“It is impossible and absurd!
"All that has been
invented by you, or fools like you!"
"Let me never hear you say a word
again on that subject!”

Late in the evening Colia came in with a whole budget of Petersburg and
Pavlofsk news."
"He did not dwell much on the Petersburg part of it, which
consisted chiefly of intelligence about his friend Hippolyte, but passed
quickly to the Pavlofsk tidings."
"He had gone straight to the Epanchins’
from the station."
“There’s the deuce and all going on there!” he said.
"“First of all about
the row last night, and I think there must be something new as well,
though I didn’t like to ask."
"Not a word about _you_, prince, the whole
time!"
"The most interesting fact was that Aglaya had been quarrelling
with her people about Gania."
"Colia did not know any details, except that
it had been a terrible quarrel!"
"Also Evgenie Pavlovitch had called, and
met with an excellent reception all round."
"And another curious thing:
Mrs. Epanchin was so angry that she called Varia to her--Varia was
talking to the girls--and turned her out of the house ‘once for all’ she
said."
"I heard it from Varia herself--Mrs. Epanchin was quite polite,
but firm; and when Varia said good-bye to the girls, she told them
nothing about it, and they didn’t know they were saying goodbye for the
last time."
"I’m sorry for Varia, and for Gania too; he isn’t half a bad
fellow, in spite of his faults, and I shall never forgive myself for not
liking him before!"
"I don’t know whether I ought to continue to go to the
Epanchins’ now,” concluded Colia--“I like to be quite independent of
others, and of other people’s quarrels if I can; but I must think over
it.”

“I don’t think you need break your heart over Gania,” said the prince;
“for if what you say is true, he must be considered dangerous in the
Epanchin household, and if so, certain hopes of his must have been
encouraged.”

“What?"
"What hopes?” cried Colia; “you surely don’t mean Aglaya?--oh,
no!--”

“You’re a dreadful sceptic, prince,” he continued, after a moment’s
silence."
"“I have observed of late that you have grown sceptical about
everything."
"You don’t seem to believe in people as you did, and are
always attributing motives and so on--am I using the word ‘sceptic’ in
its proper sense?”

“I believe so; but I’m not sure.”

“Well, I’ll change it, right or wrong; I’ll say that you are not
sceptical, but _jealous_."
There!
"you are deadly jealous of Gania, over
a certain proud damsel!"
"Come!” Colia jumped up, with these words, and
burst out laughing."
"He laughed as he had perhaps never laughed before,
and still more when he saw the prince flushing up to his temples."
"He was
delighted that the prince should be jealous about Aglaya."
"However, he
stopped immediately on seeing that the other was really hurt, and the
conversation continued, very earnestly, for an hour or more."
"Next day the prince had to go to town, on business."
"Returning in the
afternoon, he happened upon General Epanchin at the station."
"The latter
seized his hand, glancing around nervously, as if he were afraid
of being caught in wrong-doing, and dragged him into a first-class
compartment."
He was burning to speak about something of importance.
"“In the first place, my dear prince, don’t be angry with me."
"I would
have come to see you yesterday, but I didn’t know how Lizabetha
Prokofievna would take it."
"My dear fellow, my house is simply a hell
just now, a sort of sphinx has taken up its abode there."
"We live in an
atmosphere of riddles; I can’t make head or tail of anything."
"As for
you, I feel sure you are the least to blame of any of us, though you
certainly have been the cause of a good deal of trouble."
"You see, it’s
all very pleasant to be a philanthropist; but it can be carried too far."
"Of course I admire kind-heartedness, and I esteem my wife, but--”

The general wandered on in this disconnected way for a long time; it
was clear that he was much disturbed by some circumstance which he could
make nothing of."
"“It is plain to me, that _you_ are not in it at all,” he continued, at
last, a little less vaguely, “but perhaps you had better not come to
our house for a little while."
"I ask you in the friendliest manner,
mind; just till the wind changes again."
"As for Evgenie Pavlovitch,” he
continued with some excitement, “the whole thing is a calumny, a dirty
calumny."
"It is simply a plot, an intrigue, to upset our plans and to
stir up a quarrel."
"You see, prince, I’ll tell you privately, Evgenie and
ourselves have not said a word yet, we have no formal understanding, we
are in no way bound on either side, but the word may be said very soon,
don’t you see, _very_ soon, and all this is most injurious, and is meant
to be so."
Why?
I’m sure I can’t tell you.
"She’s an extraordinary woman,
you see, an eccentric woman; I tell you I am so frightened of that woman
that I can’t sleep."
"What a carriage that was, and where did it come
from, eh?"
"I declare, I was base enough to suspect Evgenie at first; but
it seems certain that that cannot be the case, and if so, why is she
interfering here?"
"That’s the riddle, what does she want?"
"Is it to keep
Evgenie to herself?"
"But, my dear fellow, I swear to you, I swear he
doesn’t even _know_ her, and as for those bills, why, the whole thing is
an invention!"
And the familiarity of the woman!
"It’s quite clear we must
treat the impudent creature’s attempt with disdain, and redouble our
courtesy towards Evgenie."
I told my wife so.
“Now I’ll tell you my secret conviction.
"I’m certain that she’s doing
this to revenge herself on me, on account of the past, though I assure
you that all the time I was blameless."
I blush at the very idea.
"And
now she turns up again like this, when I thought she had finally
disappeared!"
Where’s Rogojin all this time?
"I thought she was Mrs.
Rogojin, long ago.”

The old man was in a state of great mental perturbation."
"The whole of
the journey, which occupied nearly an hour, he continued in this strain,
putting questions and answering them himself, shrugging his shoulders,
pressing the prince’s hand, and assuring the latter that, at all
events, he had no suspicion whatever of _him_."
"This last assurance was
satisfactory, at all events."
"The general finished by informing him that
Evgenie’s uncle was head of one of the civil service departments, and
rich, very rich, and a gourmand."
"“And, well, Heaven preserve him, of
course--but Evgenie gets his money, don’t you see?"
"But, for all this,
I’m uncomfortable, I don’t know why."
"There’s something in the air, I
feel there’s something nasty in the air, like a bat, and I’m by no means
comfortable.”

And it was not until the third day that the formal reconciliation
between the prince and the Epanchins took place, as said before."
XII.
"It was seven in the evening, and the prince was just preparing to go
out for a walk in the park, when suddenly Mrs. Epanchin appeared on the
terrace."
"“In the first place, don’t dare to suppose,” she began, “that I am going
to apologize."
Nonsense!
"You were entirely to blame.”

The prince remained silent."
"“Were you to blame, or not?”

“No, certainly not, no more than yourself, though at first I thought I
was.”

“Oh, very well, let’s sit down, at all events, for I don’t intend to
stand up all day."
"And remember, if you say, one word about ‘mischievous
urchins,’ I shall go away and break with you altogether."
"Now then, did
you, or did you not, send a letter to Aglaya, a couple of months or so
ago, about Easter-tide?”

“Yes!”

“What for?"
What was your object?
"Show me the letter.” Mrs. Epanchin’s
eyes flashed; she was almost trembling with impatience."
"“I have not got the letter,” said the prince, timidly, extremely
surprised at the turn the conversation had taken."
"“If anyone has it, if
it still exists, Aglaya Ivanovna must have it.”

“No finessing, please."
"What did you write about?”

“I am not finessing, and I am not in the least afraid of telling you;
but I don’t see the slightest reason why I should not have written.”

“Be quiet, you can talk afterwards!"
What was the letter about?
"Why are
you blushing?”

The prince was silent."
At last he spoke.
"“I don’t understand your thoughts, Lizabetha Prokofievna; but I can see
that the fact of my having written is for some reason repugnant to you."
"You must admit that I have a perfect right to refuse to answer your
questions; but, in order to show you that I am neither ashamed of
the letter, nor sorry that I wrote it, and that I am not in the least
inclined to blush about it” (here the prince’s blushes redoubled), “I
will repeat the substance of my letter, for I think I know it almost by
heart.”

So saying, the prince repeated the letter almost word for word, as he
had written it."
"“My goodness, what utter twaddle, and what may all this nonsense have
signified, pray?"
"If it had any meaning at all!” said Mrs. Epanchin,
cuttingly, after having listened with great attention."
"“I really don’t absolutely know myself; I know my feeling was very
sincere."
"I had moments at that time full of life and hope.”

“What sort of hope?”

“It is difficult to explain, but certainly not the hopes you have in
your mind."
"Hopes--well, in a word, hopes for the future, and a feeling
of joy that _there_, at all events, I was not entirely a stranger and a
foreigner."
"I felt an ecstasy in being in my native land once more; and
one sunny morning I took up a pen and wrote her that letter, but why to
_her_, I don’t quite know."
"Sometimes one longs to have a friend near, and
I evidently felt the need of one then,” added the prince, and paused."
"“Are you in love with her?”

“N-no!"
"I wrote to her as to a sister; I signed myself her brother.”

“Oh yes, of course, on purpose!"
"I quite understand.”

“It is very painful to me to answer these questions, Lizabetha
Prokofievna.”

“I dare say it is; but that’s no affair of mine."
"Now then, assure me
truly as before Heaven, are you lying to me or not?”

“No, I am not lying.”

“Are you telling the truth when you say you are not in love?”

“I believe it is the absolute truth.”

“‘I believe,’ indeed!"
"Did that mischievous urchin give it to her?”

“I asked Nicolai Ardalionovitch...”

“The urchin!"
"the urchin!” interrupted Lizabetha Prokofievna in an angry
voice."
“I do not want to know if it were Nicolai Ardalionovitch!
"The
urchin!”

“Nicolai Ardalionovitch...”

“The urchin, I tell you!”

“No, it was not the urchin: it was Nicolai Ardalionovitch,” said the
prince very firmly, but without raising his voice."
"“Well, all right!"
"All right, my dear!"
"I shall put that down to your
account.”

She was silent a moment to get breath, and to recover her composure."
"“Well!--and what’s the meaning of the ‘poor knight,’ eh?”

“I don’t know in the least; I wasn’t present when the joke was made."
"It
_is_ a joke."
"I suppose, and that’s all.”

“Well, that’s a comfort, at all events."
"You don’t suppose she could take
any interest in you, do you?"
"Why, she called you an ‘idiot’ herself.”

“I think you might have spared me that,” murmured the prince
reproachfully, almost in a whisper."
"“Don’t be angry; she is a wilful, mad, spoilt girl."
"If she likes a
person she will pitch into him, and chaff him."
"I used to be just such
another."
"But for all that you needn’t flatter yourself, my boy; she is
not for you."
"I don’t believe it, and it is not to be."
"I tell you so at
once, so that you may take proper precautions."
"Now, I want to hear you
swear that you are not married to that woman?”

“Lizabetha Prokofievna, what are you thinking of?” cried the prince,
almost leaping to his feet in amazement."
“Why?
"You very nearly were, anyhow.”

“Yes--I nearly was,” whispered the prince, hanging his head."
"“Well then, have you come here for _her?_ Are you in love with _her?_
With _that_ creature?”

“I did not come to marry at all,” replied the prince."
"“Is there anything you hold sacred?”

“There is.”

“Then swear by it that you did not come here to marry _her!_”

“I’ll swear it by whatever you please.”

“I believe you."
You may kiss me; I breathe freely at last.
"But you must
know, my dear friend, Aglaya does not love you, and she shall never be
your wife while I am out of my grave."
So be warned in time.
"Do you hear
me?”

“Yes, I hear.”

The prince flushed up so much that he could not look her in the face."
"“I have waited for you with the greatest impatience (not that you were
worth it)."
"Every night I have drenched my pillow with tears, not for
you, my friend, not for you, don’t flatter yourself!"
"I have my own
grief, always the same, always the same."
"But I’ll tell you why I have
been awaiting you so impatiently, because I believe that Providence
itself sent you to be a friend and a brother to me."
"I haven’t a friend
in the world except Princess Bielokonski, and she is growing as stupid
as a sheep from old age."
"Now then, tell me, yes or no?"
"Do you know why
she called out from her carriage the other night?”

“I give you my word of honour that I had nothing to do with the matter
and know nothing about it.”

“Very well, I believe you."
I have my own ideas about it.
"Up to yesterday
morning I thought it was really Evgenie Pavlovitch who was to blame; now
I cannot help agreeing with the others."
"But why he was made such a fool
of I cannot understand."
"However, he is not going to marry Aglaya, I can
tell you that."
"He may be a very excellent fellow, but--so it shall be."
"I was not at all sure of accepting him before, but now I have quite made
up my mind that I won’t have him."
"‘Put me in my coffin first and then
into my grave, and then you may marry my daughter to whomsoever you
please,’ so I said to the general this very morning."
"You see how I trust
you, my boy.”

“Yes, I see and understand.”

Mrs. Epanchin gazed keenly into the prince’s eyes."
"She was anxious to
see what impression the news as to Evgenie Pavlovitch had made upon him."
“Do you know anything about Gavrila Ardalionovitch?” she asked at last.
"“Oh yes, I know a good deal.”

“Did you know he had communications with Aglaya?”

“No, I didn’t,” said the prince, trembling a little, and in great
agitation."
"“You say Gavrila Ardalionovitch has private communications
with Aglaya?--Impossible!”

“Only quite lately."
"His sister has been working like a rat to clear the
way for him all the winter.”

“I don’t believe it!” said the prince abruptly, after a short pause."
"“Had it been so I should have known long ago.”

“Oh, of course, yes; he would have come and wept out his secret on your
bosom."
"Oh, you simpleton--you simpleton!"
"Anyone can deceive you and take
you in like a--like a,--aren’t you ashamed to trust him?"
"Can’t you see
that he humbugs you just as much as ever he pleases?”

“I know very well that he does deceive me occasionally, and he knows
that I know it, but--” The prince did not finish his sentence."
"“And that’s why you trust him, eh?"
So I should have supposed.
"Good Lord,
was there ever such a man as you?"
Tfu!
"and are you aware, sir, that this
Gania, or his sister Varia, have brought her into correspondence with
Nastasia Philipovna?”

“Brought whom?” cried Muishkin."
"“Aglaya.”

“I don’t believe it!"
It’s impossible!
"What object could they have?” He
jumped up from his chair in his excitement."
"“Nor do I believe it, in spite of the proofs."
"The girl is self-willed
and fantastic, and insane!"
"She’s wicked, wicked!"
"I’ll repeat it for
a thousand years that she’s wicked; they _all_ are, just now, all my
daughters, even that ‘wet hen’ Alexandra."
And yet I don’t believe it.
"Because I don’t choose to believe it, perhaps; but I don’t."
"Why haven’t
you been?” she turned on the prince suddenly."
"“Why didn’t you come near
us all these three days, eh?”

The prince began to give his reasons, but she interrupted him again."
“Everybody takes you in and deceives you; you went to town yesterday.
"I
dare swear you went down on your knees to that rogue, and begged him to
accept your ten thousand roubles!”

“I never thought of doing any such thing."
"I have not seen him, and he is
not a rogue, in my opinion."
"I have had a letter from him.”

“Show it me!”

The prince took a paper from his pocket-book, and handed it to Lizabetha
Prokofievna."
"It ran as follows:


“SIR,

“In the eyes of the world I am sure that I have no cause for pride or
self-esteem."
I am much too insignificant for that.
"But what may be so to
other men’s eyes is not so to yours."
"I am convinced that you are better
than other people."
"Doktorenko disagrees with me, but I am content to
differ from him on this point."
"I will never accept one single copeck
from you, but you have helped my mother, and I am bound to be grateful
to you for that, however weak it may seem."
"At any rate, I have changed
my opinion about you, and I think right to inform you of the fact; but I
also suppose that there can be no further intercourse between us."
“ANTIP BURDOVSKY.
"“P.S.--The two hundred roubles I owe you shall certainly be repaid in
time.”


“How extremely stupid!” cried Mrs. Epanchin, giving back the letter
abruptly."
“It was not worth the trouble of reading.
"Why are you
smiling?”

“Confess that you are pleased to have read it.”

“What!"
Pleased with all that nonsense!
"Why, cannot you see that they are
all infatuated with pride and vanity?”

“He has acknowledged himself to be in the wrong."
"Don’t you see that the
greater his vanity, the more difficult this admission must have been on
his part?"
"Oh, what a little child you are, Lizabetha Prokofievna!”

“Are you tempting me to box your ears for you, or what?”

“Not at all."
I am only proving that you are glad about the letter.
"Why
conceal your real feelings?"
"You always like to do it.”

“Never come near my house again!” cried Mrs. Epanchin, pale with rage."
“Don’t let me see as much as a _shadow_ of you about the place!
"Do you
hear?”

“Oh yes, and in three days you’ll come and invite me yourself."
"Aren’t
you ashamed now?"
"These are your best feelings; you are only tormenting
yourself.”

“I’ll die before I invite you!"
I shall forget your very name!
"I’ve
forgotten it already!”

She marched towards the door."
"“But I’m forbidden your house as it is, without your added threats!”
 cried the prince after her."
“What?
"Who forbade you?”

She turned round so suddenly that one might have supposed a needle had
been stuck into her."
The prince hesitated.
He perceived that he had said too much now.
“_Who_ forbade you?” cried Mrs. Epanchin once more.
"“Aglaya Ivanovna told me--”

“When?"
"Speak--quick!”

“She sent to say, yesterday morning, that I was never to dare to come
near the house again.”

Lizabetha Prokofievna stood like a stone."
“What did she send?
Whom?
Was it that boy?
"Was it a message?--quick!”

“I had a note,” said the prince."
“Where is it?
"Give it here, at once.”

The prince thought a moment."
"Then he pulled out of his waistcoat pocket
an untidy slip of paper, on which was scrawled:


“PRINCE LEF NICOLAIEVITCH,--If you think fit, after all that has passed,
to honour our house with a visit, I can assure you you will not find me
among the number of those who are in any way delighted to see you."
"“AGLAYA EPANCHIN.”


Mrs. Epanchin reflected a moment."
"The next minute she flew at the
prince, seized his hand, and dragged him after her to the door."
"“Quick--come along!” she cried, breathless with agitation and
impatience."
"“Come along with me this moment!”

“But you declared I wasn’t--”

“Don’t be a simpleton."
"You behave just as though you weren’t a man at
all."
Come on!
"I shall see, now, with my own eyes."
"I shall see all.”

“Well, let me get my hat, at least.”

“Here’s your miserable hat."
"He couldn’t even choose a respectable shape
for his hat!"
Come on!
"She did that because I took your part and said you
ought to have come--little vixen!--else she would never have sent you
that silly note."
"It’s a most improper note, I call it; most improper for
such an intelligent, well-brought-up girl to write."
H’m!
"I dare say she
was annoyed that you didn’t come; but she ought to have known that one
can’t write like that to an idiot like you, for you’d be sure to take it
literally.” Mrs. Epanchin was dragging the prince along with her all
the time, and never let go of his hand for an instant."
"“What are you
listening for?” she added, seeing that she had committed herself a
little."
"“She wants a clown like you--she hasn’t seen one for some
time--to play with."
"That’s why she is anxious for you to come to the
house."
And right glad I am that she’ll make a thorough good fool of you.
You deserve it; and she can do it--oh!
"she can, indeed!--as well as most
people.”




PART III

I."
"The Epanchin family, or at least the more serious members of it, were
sometimes grieved because they seemed so unlike the rest of the world."
"They were not quite certain, but had at times a strong suspicion that
things did not happen to them as they did to other people."
"Others led a
quiet, uneventful life, while they were subject to continual upheavals."
"Others kept on the rails without difficulty; they ran off at the
slightest obstacle."
"Other houses were governed by a timid routine;
theirs was somehow different."
"Perhaps Lizabetha Prokofievna was alone
in making these fretful observations; the girls, though not wanting in
intelligence, were still young; the general was intelligent, too, but
narrow, and in any difficulty he was content to say, “H’m!” and leave
the matter to his wife."
"Consequently, on her fell the responsibility."
"It
was not that they distinguished themselves as a family by any particular
originality, or that their excursions off the track led to any breach of
the proprieties."
Oh no.
"There was nothing premeditated, there was not even any conscious purpose
in it all, and yet, in spite of everything, the family, although highly
respected, was not quite what every highly respected family ought to be."
"For a long time now Lizabetha Prokofievna had had it in her mind that
all the trouble was owing to her “unfortunate character,” and this
added to her distress."
"She blamed her own stupid unconventional
“eccentricity.” Always restless, always on the go, she constantly seemed
to lose her way, and to get into trouble over the simplest and more
ordinary affairs of life."
"We said at the beginning of our story, that the Epanchins were liked
and esteemed by their neighbours."
"In spite of his humble origin, Ivan
Fedorovitch himself was received everywhere with respect."
"He deserved
this, partly on account of his wealth and position, partly because,
though limited, he was really a very good fellow."
"But a certain
limitation of mind seems to be an indispensable asset, if not to all
public personages, at least to all serious financiers."
"Added to this,
his manner was modest and unassuming; he knew when to be silent, yet
never allowed himself to be trampled upon."
"Also--and this was more
important than all--he had the advantage of being under exalted
patronage."
"As to Lizabetha Prokofievna, she, as the reader knows, belonged to an
aristocratic family."
"True, Russians think more of influential friends
than of birth, but she had both."
"She was esteemed and even loved by
people of consequence in society, whose example in receiving her was
therefore followed by others."
"It seems hardly necessary to remark that
her family worries and anxieties had little or no foundation, or that
her imagination increased them to an absurd degree; but if you have a
wart on your forehead or nose, you imagine that all the world is looking
at it, and that people would make fun of you because of it, even if you
had discovered America!"
"Doubtless Lizabetha Prokofievna was considered
“eccentric” in society, but she was none the less esteemed: the pity was
that she was ceasing to believe in that esteem."
"When she thought of
her daughters, she said to herself sorrowfully that she was a hindrance
rather than a help to their future, that her character and temper were
absurd, ridiculous, insupportable."
"Naturally, she put the blame on her
surroundings, and from morning to night was quarrelling with her husband
and children, whom she really loved to the point of self-sacrifice,
even, one might say, of passion."
"She was, above all distressed by the idea that her daughters might grow
up “eccentric,” like herself; she believed that no other society girls
were like them."
"“They are growing into Nihilists!” she repeated over and
over again."
"For years she had tormented herself with this idea, and with
the question: “Why don’t they get married?”

“It is to annoy their mother; that is their one aim in life; it can be
nothing else."
"The fact is it is all of a piece with these modern ideas,
that wretched woman’s question!"
"Six months ago Aglaya took a fancy to
cut off her magnificent hair."
"Why, even I, when I was young, had nothing
like it!"
"The scissors were in her hand, and I had to go down on my knees
and implore her... She did it, I know, from sheer mischief, to spite
her mother, for she is a naughty, capricious girl, a real spoiled child
spiteful and mischievous to a degree!"
"And then Alexandra wanted to shave
her head, not from caprice or mischief, but, like a little fool, simply
because Aglaya persuaded her she would sleep better without her hair,
and not suffer from headache!"
"And how many suitors have they not had
during the last five years!"
"Excellent offers, too!"
"What more do they
want?"
Why don’t they get married?
"For no other reason than to vex their
mother--none--none!”

But Lizabetha Prokofievna felt somewhat consoled when she could say that
one of her girls, Adelaida, was settled at last."
"“It will be one off our
hands!” she declared aloud, though in private she expressed herself with
greater tenderness."
"The engagement was both happy and suitable, and was
therefore approved in society."
"Prince S. was a distinguished man, he
had money, and his future wife was devoted to him; what more could
be desired?"
"Lizabetha Prokofievna had felt less anxious about this
daughter, however, although she considered her artistic tastes
suspicious."
"But to make up for them she was, as her mother expressed it,
“merry,” and had plenty of “common-sense.” It was Aglaya’s future which
disturbed her most."
"With regard to her eldest daughter, Alexandra, the
mother never quite knew whether there was cause for anxiety or not."
Sometimes she felt as if there was nothing to be expected from her.
"She
was twenty-five now, and must be fated to be an old maid, and “with such
beauty, too!” The mother spent whole nights in weeping and lamenting,
while all the time the cause of her grief slumbered peacefully."
"“What is
the matter with her?"
"Is she a Nihilist, or simply a fool?”

But Lizabetha Prokofievna knew perfectly well how unnecessary was the
last question."
"She set a high value on Alexandra Ivanovna’s judgment,
and often consulted her in difficulties; but that she was a ‘wet
hen’ she never for a moment doubted."
"“She is so calm; nothing rouses
her--though wet hens are not always calm!"
Oh!
"I can’t understand
it!” Her eldest daughter inspired Lizabetha with a kind of puzzled
compassion."
"She did not feel this in Aglaya’s case, though the latter
was her idol."
"It may be said that these outbursts and epithets, such as
“wet hen” (in which the maternal solicitude usually showed itself),
only made Alexandra laugh."
"Sometimes the most trivial thing annoyed Mrs.
Epanchin, and drove her into a frenzy."
"For instance, Alexandra Ivanovna
liked to sleep late, and was always dreaming, though her dreams had the
peculiarity of being as innocent and naive as those of a child of seven;
and the very innocence of her dreams annoyed her mother."
"Once she dreamt
of nine hens, and this was the cause of quite a serious quarrel--no
one knew why."
"Another time she had--it was most unusual--a dream with
a spark of originality in it."
"She dreamt of a monk in a dark room, into
which she was too frightened to go."
"Adelaida and Aglaya rushed off with
shrieks of laughter to relate this to their mother, but she was quite
angry, and said her daughters were all fools."
“H’m!
she is as stupid as a fool!
A veritable ‘wet hen’!
"Nothing excites
her; and yet she is not happy; some days it makes one miserable only
to look at her!"
"Why is she unhappy, I wonder?” At times Lizabetha
Prokofievna put this question to her husband, and as usual she spoke
in the threatening tone of one who demands an immediate answer."
"Ivan
Fedorovitch would frown, shrug his shoulders, and at last give his
opinion: “She needs a husband!”

“God forbid that he should share your ideas, Ivan Fedorovitch!” his wife
flashed back."
"“Or that he should be as gross and churlish as you!”

The general promptly made his escape, and Lizabetha Prokofievna after a
while grew calm again."
"That evening, of course, she would be unusually
attentive, gentle, and respectful to her “gross and churlish” husband,
her “dear, kind Ivan Fedorovitch,” for she had never left off loving
him."
She was even still “in love” with him.
"He knew it well, and for his
part held her in the greatest esteem."
But the mother’s great and continual anxiety was Aglaya.
"“She is exactly
like me--my image in everything,” said Mrs. Epanchin to herself."
"“A
tyrant!"
A real little demon!
A Nihilist!
"Eccentric, senseless and
mischievous!"
"Good Lord, how unhappy she will be!”

But as we said before, the fact of Adelaida’s approaching marriage was
balm to the mother."
For a whole month she forgot her fears and worries.
"Adelaida’s fate was settled; and with her name that of Aglaya’s was
linked, in society gossip."
"People whispered that Aglaya, too, was “as
good as engaged;” and Aglaya always looked so sweet and behaved so
well (during this period), that the mother’s heart was full of joy."
"Of
course, Evgenie Pavlovitch must be thoroughly studied first, before
the final step should be taken; but, really, how lovely dear Aglaya had
become--she actually grew more beautiful every day!"
"And then--Yes, and
then--this abominable prince showed his face again, and everything went
topsy-turvy at once, and everyone seemed as mad as March hares."
What had really happened?
"If it had been any other family than the Epanchins’, nothing particular
would have happened."
"But, thanks to Mrs. Epanchin’s invariable fussiness
and anxiety, there could not be the slightest hitch in the simplest
matters of everyday life, but she immediately foresaw the most dreadful
and alarming consequences, and suffered accordingly."
"What then must have been her condition, when, among all the imaginary
anxieties and calamities which so constantly beset her, she now saw
looming ahead a serious cause for annoyance--something really likely to
arouse doubts and suspicions!"
"“How dared they, how _dared_ they write that hateful anonymous letter
informing me that Aglaya is in communication with Nastasia Philipovna?”
 she thought, as she dragged the prince along towards her own house,
and again when she sat him down at the round table where the family was
already assembled."
“How dared they so much as _think_ of such a thing?
"I
should _die_ with shame if I thought there was a particle of truth in it,
or if I were to show the letter to Aglaya herself!"
"Who dares play these
jokes upon _us_, the Epanchins?"
"_Why_ didn’t we go to the Yelagin instead
of coming down here?"
"I _told_ you we had better go to the Yelagin this
summer, Ivan Fedorovitch."
It’s all your fault.
"I dare say it was that
Varia who sent the letter."
It’s all Ivan Fedorovitch.
"_That_ woman is
doing it all for him, I know she is, to show she can make a fool of him
now just as she did when he used to give her pearls."
"“But after all is said, we are mixed up in it."
"Your daughters are mixed
up in it, Ivan Fedorovitch; young ladies in society, young ladies at an
age to be married; they were present, they heard everything there was to
hear."
"They were mixed up with that other scene, too, with those dreadful
youths."
You must be pleased to remember they heard it all.
"I cannot
forgive that wretched prince."
I never shall forgive him!
"And why, if you
please, has Aglaya had an attack of nerves for these last three
days?"
"Why has she all but quarrelled with her sisters, even with
Alexandra--whom she respects so much that she always kisses her hands as
though she were her mother?"
"What are all these riddles of hers that we
have to guess?"
What has Gavrila Ardalionovitch to do with it?
"Why did
she take upon herself to champion him this morning, and burst into tears
over it?"
"Why is there an allusion to that cursed ‘poor knight’ in the
anonymous letter?"
"And why did I rush off to him just now like a lunatic,
and drag him back here?"
I do believe I’ve gone mad at last.
"What on
earth have I done now?"
"To talk to a young man about my daughter’s
secrets--and secrets having to do with himself, too!"
"Thank goodness,
he’s an idiot, and a friend of the house!"
"Surely Aglaya hasn’t fallen in
love with such a gaby!"
What an idea!
Pfu!
"we ought all to be put under
glass cases--myself first of all--and be shown off as curiosities, at
ten copecks a peep!”

“I shall never forgive you for all this, Ivan Fedorovitch--never!"
"Look
at her now."
Why doesn’t she make fun of him?
"She said she would, and she
doesn’t."
Look there!
"She stares at him with all her eyes, and doesn’t
move; and yet she told him not to come."
"He looks pale enough; and that
abominable chatterbox, Evgenie Pavlovitch, monopolizes the whole of the
conversation."
Nobody else can get a word in.
"I could soon find out all
about everything if I could only change the subject.”

The prince certainly was very pale."
"He sat at the table and seemed to be
feeling, by turns, sensations of alarm and rapture."
"Oh, how frightened he was of looking to one side--one particular
corner--whence he knew very well that a pair of dark eyes were watching
him intently, and how happy he was to think that he was once more among
them, and occasionally hearing that well-known voice, although she had
written and forbidden him to come again!"
"“What on earth will she say to me, I wonder?” he thought to himself."
"He had not said a word yet; he sat silent and listened to Evgenie
Pavlovitch’s eloquence."
"The latter had never appeared so happy and
excited as on this evening."
"The prince listened to him, but for a long
time did not take in a word he said."
"Excepting Ivan Fedorovitch, who had not as yet returned from town, the
whole family was present."
"Prince S. was there; and they all intended to
go out to hear the band very soon."
Colia arrived presently and joined the circle.
"“So he is received as
usual, after all,” thought the prince."
"The Epanchins’ country-house was a charming building, built after the
model of a Swiss chalet, and covered with creepers."
"It was surrounded on
all sides by a flower garden, and the family sat, as a rule, on the open
verandah as at the prince’s house."
"The subject under discussion did not appear to be very popular with the
assembly, and some would have been delighted to change it; but Evgenie
would not stop holding forth, and the prince’s arrival seemed to spur
him on to still further oratorical efforts."
"Lizabetha Prokofievna frowned, but had not as yet grasped the subject,
which seemed to have arisen out of a heated argument."
"Aglaya sat apart,
almost in the corner, listening in stubborn silence."
"“Excuse me,” continued Evgenie Pavlovitch hotly, “I don’t say a word
against liberalism."
"Liberalism is not a sin, it is a necessary part of
a great whole, which whole would collapse and fall to pieces without
it."
"Liberalism has just as much right to exist as has the most moral
conservatism; but I am attacking _Russian_ liberalism; and I attack it for
the simple reason that a Russian liberal is not a Russian liberal, he is
a non-Russian liberal."
"Show me a real Russian liberal, and I’ll kiss him
before you all, with pleasure.”

“If he cared to kiss you, that is,” said Alexandra, whose cheeks were
red with irritation and excitement."
"“Look at that, now,” thought the mother to herself, “she does nothing
but sleep and eat for a year at a time, and then suddenly flies out in
the most incomprehensible way!”

The prince observed that Alexandra appeared to be angry with Evgenie,
because he spoke on a serious subject in a frivolous manner, pretending
to be in earnest, but with an under-current of irony."
"“I was saying just now, before you came in, prince, that there has
been nothing national up to now, about our liberalism, and nothing the
liberals do, or have done, is in the least degree national."
"They are
drawn from two classes only, the old landowning class, and clerical
families--”

“How, nothing that they have done is Russian?” asked Prince S.

“It may be Russian, but it is not national."
"Our liberals are not
Russian, nor are our conservatives, and you may be sure that the nation
does not recognize anything that has been done by the landed gentry, or
by the seminarists, or what is to be done either.”

“Come, that’s good!"
How can you maintain such a paradox?
"If you are
serious, that is."
"I cannot allow such a statement about the landed
proprietors to pass unchallenged."
"Why, you are a landed proprietor
yourself!” cried Prince S. hotly."
"“I suppose you’ll say there is nothing national about our literature
either?” said Alexandra."
"“Well, I am not a great authority on literary questions, but I
certainly do hold that Russian literature is not Russian, except perhaps
Lomonosoff, Pouschkin and Gogol.”

“In the first place, that is a considerable admission, and in the second
place, one of the above was a peasant, and the other two were both
landed proprietors!”

“Quite so, but don’t be in such a hurry!"
"For since it has been the part
of these three men, and only these three, to say something absolutely
their own, not borrowed, so by this very fact these three men become
really national."
"If any Russian shall have done or said anything really
and absolutely original, he is to be called national from that moment,
though he may not be able to talk the Russian language; still he is a
national Russian."
I consider that an axiom.
"But we were not speaking
of literature; we began by discussing the socialists."
"Very well then,
I insist that there does not exist one single Russian socialist."
"There
does not, and there has never existed such a one, because all socialists
are derived from the two classes--the landed proprietors, and the
seminarists."
"All our eminent socialists are merely old liberals of
the class of landed proprietors, men who were liberals in the days of
serfdom."
Why do you laugh?
"Give me their books, give me their studies,
their memoirs, and though I am not a literary critic, yet I will prove
as clear as day that every chapter and every word of their writings has
been the work of a former landed proprietor of the old school."
"You’ll
find that all their raptures, all their generous transports are
proprietary, all their woes and their tears, proprietary; all
proprietary or seminarist!"
"You are laughing again, and you, prince, are
smiling too."
"Don’t you agree with me?”

It was true enough that everybody was laughing, the prince among them."
"“I cannot tell you on the instant whether I agree with you or not,”
 said the latter, suddenly stopping his laughter, and starting like a
schoolboy caught at mischief."
"“But, I assure you, I am listening to you
with extreme gratification.”

So saying, he almost panted with agitation, and a cold sweat stood upon
his forehead."
"These were his first words since he had entered the house;
he tried to lift his eyes, and look around, but dared not; Evgenie
Pavlovitch noticed his confusion, and smiled."
"“I’ll just tell you one fact, ladies and gentlemen,” continued the
latter, with apparent seriousness and even exaltation of manner, but
with a suggestion of “chaff” behind every word, as though he were
laughing in his sleeve at his own nonsense--“a fact, the discovery
of which, I believe, I may claim to have made by myself alone."
"At all
events, no other has ever said or written a word about it; and in this
fact is expressed the whole essence of Russian liberalism of the sort
which I am now considering."
"“In the first place, what is liberalism, speaking generally, but an
attack (whether mistaken or reasonable, is quite another question) upon
the existing order of things?"
Is this so?
Yes.
Very well.
"Then my ‘fact’
consists in this, that _Russian_ liberalism is not an attack upon the
existing order of things, but an attack upon the very essence of things
themselves--indeed, on the things themselves; not an attack on the
Russian order of things, but on Russia itself."
"My Russian liberal
goes so far as to reject Russia; that is, he hates and strikes his own
mother."
"Every misfortune and mishap of the mother-country fills him with
mirth, and even with ecstasy."
"He hates the national customs, Russian
history, and everything."
"If he has a justification, it is that he does
not know what he is doing, and believes that his hatred of Russia is the
grandest and most profitable kind of liberalism."
"(You will often find
a liberal who is applauded and esteemed by his fellows, but who is in
reality the dreariest, blindest, dullest of conservatives, and is not
aware of the fact.)"
"This hatred for Russia has been mistaken by some of
our ‘Russian liberals’ for sincere love of their country, and they
boast that they see better than their neighbours what real love of one’s
country should consist in."
"But of late they have grown, more candid and
are ashamed of the expression ‘love of country,’ and have annihilated
the very spirit of the words as something injurious and petty and
undignified."
"This is the truth, and I hold by it; but at the same time
it is a phenomenon which has not been repeated at any other time or
place; and therefore, though I hold to it as a fact, yet I recognize
that it is an accidental phenomenon, and may likely enough pass away."
"There can be no such thing anywhere else as a liberal who really hates
his country; and how is this fact to be explained among _us?_ By
my original statement that a Russian liberal is _not_ a _Russian_
liberal--that’s the only explanation that I can see.”

“I take all that you have said as a joke,” said Prince S. seriously."
"“I have not seen all kinds of liberals, and cannot, therefore, set
myself up as a judge,” said Alexandra, “but I have heard all you have
said with indignation."
"You have taken some accidental case and twisted
it into a universal law, which is unjust.”

“Accidental case!” said Evgenie Pavlovitch."
"“Do you consider it an
accidental case, prince?”

“I must also admit,” said the prince, “that I have not seen much, or
been very far into the question; but I cannot help thinking that you are
more or less right, and that Russian liberalism--that phase of it which
you are considering, at least--really is sometimes inclined to hate
Russia itself, and not only its existing order of things in general."
"Of
course this is only _partially_ the truth; you cannot lay down the law for
all...”

The prince blushed and broke off, without finishing what he meant to
say."
"In spite of his shyness and agitation, he could not help being greatly
interested in the conversation."
"A special characteristic of his was
the naive candour with which he always listened to arguments which
interested him, and with which he answered any questions put to him on
the subject at issue."
"In the very expression of his face this naivete
was unmistakably evident, this disbelief in the insincerity of others,
and unsuspecting disregard of irony or humour in their words."
"But though Evgenie Pavlovitch had put his questions to the prince with
no other purpose but to enjoy the joke of his simple-minded seriousness,
yet now, at his answer, he was surprised into some seriousness himself,
and looked gravely at Muishkin as though he had not expected that sort
of answer at all."
"“Why, how strange!” he ejaculated."
"“You didn’t answer me seriously,
surely, did you?”

“Did not you ask me the question seriously” inquired the prince, in
amazement."
Everybody laughed.
"“Oh, trust _him_ for that!” said Adelaida."
"“Evgenie Pavlovitch turns
everything and everybody he can lay hold of to ridicule."
"You should hear
the things he says sometimes, apparently in perfect seriousness.”

“In my opinion the conversation has been a painful one throughout, and
we ought never to have begun it,” said Alexandra."
"“We were all going for
a walk--”

“Come along then,” said Evgenie; “it’s a glorious evening."
"But, to prove
that this time I was speaking absolutely seriously, and especially
to prove this to the prince (for you, prince, have interested me
exceedingly, and I swear to you that I am not quite such an ass as
I like to appear sometimes, although I am rather an ass, I admit),
and--well, ladies and gentlemen, will you allow me to put just one more
question to the prince, out of pure curiosity?"
It shall be the last.
"This question came into my mind a couple of hours since (you see,
prince, I do think seriously at times), and I made my own decision upon
it; now I wish to hear what the prince will say to it.”

“We have just used the expression ‘accidental case.’ This is a
significant phrase; we often hear it."
"Well, not long since everyone was
talking and reading about that terrible murder of six people on the part
of a--young fellow, and of the extraordinary speech of the counsel for
the defence, who observed that in the poverty-stricken condition of the
criminal it must have come _naturally_ into his head to kill these six
people."
"I do not quote his words, but that is the sense of them, or
something very like it."
"Now, in my opinion, the barrister who put
forward this extraordinary plea was probably absolutely convinced that
he was stating the most liberal, the most humane, the most enlightened
view of the case that could possibly be brought forward in these days."
"Now, was this distortion, this capacity for a perverted way of viewing
things, a special or accidental case, or is such a general rule?”

Everyone laughed at this."
"“A special case--accidental, of course!” cried Alexandra and Adelaida."
"“Let me remind you once more, Evgenie,” said Prince S., “that your joke
is getting a little threadbare.”

“What do you think about it, prince?” asked Evgenie, taking no notice
of the last remark, and observing Muishkin’s serious eyes fixed upon his
face."
"“What do you think--was it a special or a usual case--the rule, or
an exception?"
"I confess I put the question especially for you.”

“No, I don’t think it was a special case,” said the prince, quietly, but
firmly."
"“My dear fellow!” cried Prince S., with some annoyance, “don’t you see
that he is chaffing you?"
"He is simply laughing at you, and wants to make
game of you.”

“I thought Evgenie Pavlovitch was talking seriously,” said the prince,
blushing and dropping his eyes."
"“My dear prince,” continued Prince S. “remember what you and I were
saying two or three months ago."
"We spoke of the fact that in our newly
opened Law Courts one could already lay one’s finger upon so many
talented and remarkable young barristers."
"How pleased you were with
the state of things as we found it, and how glad I was to observe your
delight!"
"We both said it was a matter to be proud of; but this clumsy
defence that Evgenie mentions, this strange argument _can_, of course,
only be an accidental case--one in a thousand!”

The prince reflected a little, but very soon he replied, with absolute
conviction in his tone, though he still spoke somewhat shyly and
timidly:

“I only wished to say that this ‘distortion,’ as Evgenie Pavlovitch
expressed it, is met with very often, and is far more the general rule
than the exception, unfortunately for Russia."
"So much so, that if this
distortion were not the general rule, perhaps these dreadful crimes
would be less frequent.”

“Dreadful crimes?"
"But I can assure you that crimes just as dreadful,
and probably more horrible, have occurred before our times, and at all
times, and not only here in Russia, but everywhere else as well."
"And in
my opinion it is not at all likely that such murders will cease to occur
for a very long time to come."
"The only difference is that in former
times there was less publicity, while now everyone talks and writes
freely about such things--which fact gives the impression that such
crimes have only now sprung into existence."
"That is where your mistake
lies--an extremely natural mistake, I assure you, my dear fellow!” said
Prince S.

“I know that there were just as many, and just as terrible, crimes
before our times."
"Not long since I visited a convict prison and made
acquaintance with some of the criminals."
"There were some even more
dreadful criminals than this one we have been speaking of--men who
have murdered a dozen of their fellow-creatures, and feel no remorse
whatever."
"But what I especially noticed was this, that the very most
hopeless and remorseless murderer--however hardened a criminal he may
be--still _knows that he is a criminal_; that is, he is conscious that
he has acted wickedly, though he may feel no remorse whatever."
"And they
were all like this."
"Those of whom Evgenie Pavlovitch has spoken, do not
admit that they are criminals at all; they think they had a right to
do what they did, and that they were even doing a good deed, perhaps."
I consider there is the greatest difference between the two cases.
"And recollect--it was a _youth_, at the particular age which is most
helplessly susceptible to the distortion of ideas!”

Prince S. was now no longer smiling; he gazed at the prince in
bewilderment."
"Alexandra, who had seemed to wish to put in her word when the prince
began, now sat silent, as though some sudden thought had caused her to
change her mind about speaking."
"Evgenie Pavlovitch gazed at him in real surprise, and this time his
expression of face had no mockery in it whatever."
"“What are you looking so surprised about, my friend?” asked Mrs.
Epanchin, suddenly."
"“Did you suppose he was stupider than yourself, and
was incapable of forming his own opinions, or what?”

“No!"
Oh no!
Not at all!” said Evgenie.
"“But--how is it, prince, that
you--(excuse the question, will you?)"
"--if you are capable of observing
and seeing things as you evidently do, how is it that you saw nothing
distorted or perverted in that claim upon your property, which you
acknowledged a day or two since; and which was full of arguments founded
upon the most distorted views of right and wrong?”

“I’ll tell you what, my friend,” cried Mrs. Epanchin, of a sudden, “here
are we all sitting here and imagining we are very clever, and perhaps
laughing at the prince, some of us, and meanwhile he has received a
letter this very day in which that same claimant renounces his claim,
and begs the prince’s pardon."
There!
"_we_ don’t often get that sort of
letter; and yet we are not ashamed to walk with our noses in the air
before him.”

“And Hippolyte has come down here to stay,” said Colia, suddenly."
“What!
"has he arrived?” said the prince, starting up."
"“Yes, I brought him down from town just after you had left the house.”

“There now!"
"It’s just like him,” cried Lizabetha Prokofievna, boiling
over once more, and entirely oblivious of the fact that she had
just taken the prince’s part."
"“I dare swear that you went up to town
yesterday on purpose to get the little wretch to do you the great honour
of coming to stay at your house."
"You did go up to town, you know you
did--you said so yourself!"
"Now then, did you, or did you not, go down on
your knees and beg him to come, confess!”

“No, he didn’t, for I saw it all myself,” said Colia."
"“On the contrary,
Hippolyte kissed his hand twice and thanked him; and all the prince said
was that he thought Hippolyte might feel better here in the country!”

“Don’t, Colia,--what is the use of saying all that?” cried the prince,
rising and taking his hat."
“Where are you going to now?” cried Mrs. Epanchin.
"“Never mind about him now, prince,” said Colia."
"“He is all right and
taking a nap after the journey."
"He is very happy to be here; but I think
perhaps it would be better if you let him alone for today,--he is very
sensitive now that he is so ill--and he might be embarrassed if you show
him too much attention at first."
"He is decidedly better today, and says
he has not felt so well for the last six months, and has coughed much
less, too.”

The prince observed that Aglaya came out of her corner and approached
the table at this point."
"He did not dare look at her, but he was conscious, to the very tips of
his fingers, that she was gazing at him, perhaps angrily; and that she
had probably flushed up with a look of fiery indignation in her black
eyes."
"“It seems to me, Mr. Colia, that you were very foolish to bring your
young friend down--if he is the same consumptive boy who wept so
profusely, and invited us all to his own funeral,” remarked Evgenie
Pavlovitch."
"“He talked so eloquently about the blank wall outside his
bedroom window, that I’m sure he will never support life here without
it.”

“I think so too,” said Mrs. Epanchin; “he will quarrel with you, and be
off,” and she drew her workbox towards her with an air of dignity, quite
oblivious of the fact that the family was about to start for a walk in
the park."
"“Yes, I remember he boasted about the blank wall in an extraordinary
way,” continued Evgenie, “and I feel that without that blank wall
he will never be able to die eloquently; and he does so long to die
eloquently!”

“Oh, you must forgive him the blank wall,” said the prince, quietly."
"“He
has come down to see a few trees now, poor fellow.”

“Oh, I forgive him with all my heart; you may tell him so if you like,”
 laughed Evgenie."
"“I don’t think you should take it quite like that,” said the prince,
quietly, and without removing his eyes from the carpet."
"“I think it is
more a case of his forgiving you.”

“Forgiving me!"
why so?
"What have I done to need his forgiveness?”

“If you don’t understand, then--but of course, you do understand."
"He wished--he wished to bless you all round and to have your
blessing--before he died--that’s all.”

“My dear prince,” began Prince S., hurriedly, exchanging glances with
some of those present, “you will not easily find heaven on earth, and
yet you seem to expect to."
"Heaven is a difficult thing to find anywhere,
prince; far more difficult than appears to that good heart of yours."
"Better stop this conversation, or we shall all be growing quite
disturbed in our minds, and--”

“Let’s go and hear the band, then,” said Lizabetha Prokofievna, angrily
rising from her place."
The rest of the company followed her example.
II.
The prince suddenly approached Evgenie Pavlovitch.
"“Evgenie Pavlovitch,” he said, with strange excitement and seizing the
latter’s hand in his own, “be assured that I esteem you as a generous
and honourable man, in spite of everything."
"Be assured of that.”

Evgenie Pavlovitch fell back a step in astonishment."
"For one moment it
was all he could do to restrain himself from bursting out laughing; but,
looking closer, he observed that the prince did not seem to be quite
himself; at all events, he was in a very curious state."
"“I wouldn’t mind betting, prince,” he cried, “that you did not in the
least mean to say that, and very likely you meant to address someone
else altogether."
What is it?
"Are you feeling unwell or anything?”

“Very likely, extremely likely, and you must be a very close observer to
detect the fact that perhaps I did not intend to come up to _you_ at all.”

So saying he smiled strangely; but suddenly and excitedly he began
again:

“Don’t remind me of what I have done or said."
Don’t!
"I am very much
ashamed of myself, I--”

“Why, what have you done?"
"I don’t understand you.”

“I see you are ashamed of me, Evgenie Pavlovitch; you are blushing for
me; that’s a sign of a good heart."
"Don’t be afraid; I shall go away
directly.”

“What’s the matter with him?"
"Do his fits begin like that?” said
Lizabetha Prokofievna, in a high state of alarm, addressing Colia."
"“No, no, Lizabetha Prokofievna, take no notice of me."
"I am not going to
have a fit."
I will go away directly; but I know I am afflicted.
"I was
twenty-four years an invalid, you see--the first twenty-four years of my
life--so take all I do and say as the sayings and actions of an
invalid."
"I’m going away directly, I really am--don’t be afraid."
"I am
not blushing, for I don’t think I need blush about it, need I?"
"But I see
that I am out of place in society--society is better without me."
"It’s
not vanity, I assure you."
"I have thought over it all these last three
days, and I have made up my mind that I ought to unbosom myself candidly
before you at the first opportunity."
"There are certain things, certain
great ideas, which I must not so much as approach, as Prince S. has
just reminded me, or I shall make you all laugh."
"I have no sense of
proportion, I know; my words and gestures do not express my ideas--they
are a humiliation and abasement of the ideas, and therefore, I have no
right--and I am too sensitive."
"Still, I believe I am beloved in this
household, and esteemed far more than I deserve."
"But I can’t help
knowing that after twenty-four years of illness there must be some trace
left, so that it is impossible for people to refrain from laughing at me
sometimes; don’t you think so?”

He seemed to pause for a reply, for some verdict, as it were, and looked
humbly around him."
"All present stood rooted to the earth with amazement at this unexpected
and apparently uncalled-for outbreak; but the poor prince’s painful and
rambling speech gave rise to a strange episode."
"“Why do you say all this here?” cried Aglaya, suddenly."
"“Why do you talk
like this to _them?_”

She appeared to be in the last stages of wrath and irritation; her eyes
flashed."
"The prince stood dumbly and blindly before her, and suddenly
grew pale."
"“There is not one of them all who is worthy of these words of yours,”
 continued Aglaya."
"“Not one of them is worth your little finger, not one
of them has heart or head to compare with yours!"
"You are more honest
than all, and better, nobler, kinder, wiser than all."
"There are some
here who are unworthy to bend and pick up the handkerchief you have just
dropped."
"Why do you humiliate yourself like this, and place yourself
lower than these people?"
Why do you debase yourself before them?
"Why
have you no pride?”

“My God!"
"Who would ever have believed this?” cried Mrs. Epanchin,
wringing her hands."
“Hurrah for the ‘poor knight’!” cried Colia.
“Be quiet!
"How dare they laugh at me in your house?” said Aglaya,
turning sharply on her mother in that hysterical frame of mind that
rides recklessly over every obstacle and plunges blindly through
proprieties."
"“Why does everyone, everyone worry and torment me?"
"Why have
they all been bullying me these three days about you, prince?"
"I will
not marry you--never, and under no circumstances!"
"Know that once and for
all; as if anyone could marry an absurd creature like you!"
"Just look in
the glass and see what you look like, this very moment!"
"Why, _why_ do they
torment me and say I am going to marry you?"
"You must know it; you are in
the plot with them!”

“No one ever tormented you on the subject,” murmured Adelaida, aghast."
“No one ever thought of such a thing!
"There has never been a word said
about it!” cried Alexandra."
“Who has been annoying her?
Who has been tormenting the child?
"Who
could have said such a thing to her?"
"Is she raving?” cried Lizabetha
Prokofievna, trembling with rage, to the company in general."
"“Every one of them has been saying it--every one of them--all these
three days!"
"And I will never, never marry him!”

So saying, Aglaya burst into bitter tears, and, hiding her face in her
handkerchief, sank back into a chair."
"“But he has never even--”

“I have never asked you to marry me, Aglaya Ivanovna!” said the prince,
of a sudden."
"“_What?_” cried Mrs. Epanchin, raising her hands in horror."
"“_What’s_
that?”

She could not believe her ears."
"“I meant to say--I only meant to say,” said the prince, faltering,
“I merely meant to explain to Aglaya Ivanovna--to have the honour to
explain, as it were--that I had no intention--never had--to ask the
honour of her hand."
"I assure you I am not guilty, Aglaya Ivanovna, I
am not, indeed."
"I never did wish to--I never thought of it at all--and
never shall--you’ll see it yourself--you may be quite assured of it."
Some wicked person has been maligning me to you; but it’s all right.
"Don’t worry about it.”

So saying, the prince approached Aglaya."
"She took the handkerchief from her face, glanced keenly at him, took
in what he had said, and burst out laughing--such a merry, unrestrained
laugh, so hearty and gay, that Adelaida could not contain herself."
"She,
too, glanced at the prince’s panic-stricken countenance, then rushed at
her sister, threw her arms round her neck, and burst into as merry a
fit of laughter as Aglaya’s own."
"They laughed together like a couple of
school-girls."
"Hearing and seeing this, the prince smiled happily, and in
accents of relief and joy, he exclaimed “Well, thank God--thank God!”

Alexandra now joined in, and it looked as though the three sisters were
going to laugh on for ever."
"“They are insane,” muttered Lizabetha Prokofievna."
"“Either they frighten
one out of one’s wits, or else--”

But Prince S. was laughing now, too, so was Evgenie Pavlovitch, so was
Colia, and so was the prince himself, who caught the infection as he
looked round radiantly upon the others."
"“Come along, let’s go out for a walk!” cried Adelaida."
"“We’ll all go
together, and the prince must absolutely go with us."
"You needn’t go
away, you dear good fellow!"
"_Isn’t_ he a dear, Aglaya?"
"Isn’t he, mother?"
"I
must really give him a kiss for--for his explanation to Aglaya just now."
"Mother, dear, I may kiss him, mayn’t I?"
"Aglaya, may I kiss _your_ prince?”
 cried the young rogue, and sure enough she skipped up to the prince and
kissed his forehead."
"He seized her hands, and pressed them so hard that Adelaida nearly cried
out; he then gazed with delight into her eyes, and raising her right
hand to his lips with enthusiasm, kissed it three times."
"“Come along,” said Aglaya."
"“Prince, you must walk with me."
"May he,
mother?"
"This young cavalier, who won’t have me?"
"You said you would _never_
have me, didn’t you, prince?"
"No--no, not like that; _that’s_ not the way
to give your arm."
Don’t you know how to give your arm to a lady yet?
There--so.
"Now, come along, you and I will lead the way."
"Would you like
to lead the way with me alone, tête-à-tête?”

She went on talking and chatting without a pause, with occasional little
bursts of laughter between."
"“Thank God--thank God!” said Lizabetha Prokofievna to herself, without
quite knowing why she felt so relieved."
"“What extraordinary people they are!” thought Prince S., for perhaps
the hundredth time since he had entered into intimate relations with the
family; but--he liked these “extraordinary people,” all the same."
"As for
Prince Lef Nicolaievitch himself, Prince S. did not seem quite to like
him, somehow."
"He was decidedly preoccupied and a little disturbed as
they all started off."
Evgenie Pavlovitch seemed to be in a lively humour.
"He made Adelaida and
Alexandra laugh all the way to the Vauxhall; but they both laughed
so very readily and promptly that the worthy Evgenie began at last to
suspect that they were not listening to him at all."
"At this idea, he burst out laughing all at once, in quite unaffected
mirth, and without giving any explanation."
"The sisters, who also appeared to be in high spirits, never tired of
glancing at Aglaya and the prince, who were walking in front."
"It was
evident that their younger sister was a thorough puzzle to them both."
"Prince S. tried hard to get up a conversation with Mrs. Epanchin upon
outside subjects, probably with the good intention of distracting and
amusing her; but he bored her dreadfully."
"She was absent-minded to a
degree, and answered at cross purposes, and sometimes not at all."
But the puzzle and mystery of Aglaya was not yet over for the evening.
The last exhibition fell to the lot of the prince alone.
"When they had
proceeded some hundred paces or so from the house, Aglaya said to her
obstinately silent cavalier in a quick half-whisper:

“Look to the right!”

The prince glanced in the direction indicated."
“Look closer.
"Do you see that bench, in the park there, just by those
three big trees--that green bench?”

The prince replied that he saw it."
“Do you like the position of it?
"Sometimes of a morning early, at seven
o’clock, when all the rest are still asleep, I come out and sit there
alone.”

The prince muttered that the spot was a lovely one."
"“Now, go away, I don’t wish to have your arm any longer; or perhaps,
better, continue to give me your arm, and walk along beside me, but
don’t speak a word to me."
"I wish to think by myself.”

The warning was certainly unnecessary; for the prince would not have
said a word all the rest of the time whether forbidden to speak or not."
"His heart beat loud and painfully when Aglaya spoke of the bench; could
she--but no!"
"he banished the thought, after an instant’s deliberation."
"At Pavlofsk, on weekdays, the public is more select than it is on
Sundays and Saturdays, when the townsfolk come down to walk about and
enjoy the park."
"The ladies dress elegantly, on these days, and it is the fashion to
gather round the band, which is probably the best of our pleasure-garden
bands, and plays the newest pieces."
"The behaviour of the public is most
correct and proper, and there is an appearance of friendly intimacy
among the usual frequenters."
"Many come for nothing but to look at their
acquaintances, but there are others who come for the sake of the music."
"It is very seldom that anything happens to break the harmony of the
proceedings, though, of course, accidents will happen everywhere."
"On this particular evening the weather was lovely, and there were
a large number of people present."
"All the places anywhere near the
orchestra were occupied."
Our friends took chairs near the side exit.
"The crowd and the music
cheered Mrs. Epanchin a little, and amused the girls; they bowed and
shook hands with some of their friends and nodded at a distance to
others; they examined the ladies’ dresses, noticed comicalities
and eccentricities among the people, and laughed and talked among
themselves."
"Evgenie Pavlovitch, too, found plenty of friends to bow to."
"Several people noticed Aglaya and the prince, who were still together."
"Before very long two or three young men had come up, and one or two
remained to talk; all of these young men appeared to be on intimate
terms with Evgenie Pavlovitch."
"Among them was a young officer, a
remarkably handsome fellow--very good-natured and a great chatterbox."
"He
tried to get up a conversation with Aglaya, and did his best to secure
her attention."
"Aglaya behaved very graciously to him, and chatted
and laughed merrily."
"Evgenie Pavlovitch begged the prince’s leave to
introduce their friend to him."
"The prince hardly realized what was
wanted of him, but the introduction came off; the two men bowed and
shook hands."
"Evgenie Pavlovitch’s friend asked the prince some question, but the
latter did not reply, or if he did, he muttered something so strangely
indistinct that there was nothing to be made of it."
"The officer stared
intently at him, then glanced at Evgenie, divined why the latter had
introduced him, and gave his undivided attention to Aglaya again."
"Only
Evgenie Pavlovitch observed that Aglaya flushed up for a moment at this."
"The prince did not notice that others were talking and making themselves
agreeable to Aglaya; in fact, at moments, he almost forgot that he was
sitting by her himself."
"At other moments he felt a longing to go away
somewhere and be alone with his thoughts, and to feel that no one knew
where he was."
"Or if that were impossible he would like to be alone at home, on the
terrace--without either Lebedeff or his children, or anyone else about
him, and to lie there and think--a day and night and another day again!"
"He thought of the mountains--and especially of a certain spot which he
used to frequent, whence he would look down upon the distant valleys and
fields, and see the waterfall, far off, like a little silver thread,
and the old ruined castle in the distance."
Oh!
"how he longed to be there
now--alone with his thoughts--to think of one thing all his life--one
thing!"
A thousand years would not be too much time!
"And let everyone
here forget him--forget him utterly!"
"How much better it would have been
if they had never known him--if all this could but prove to be a dream."
Perhaps it was a dream!
"Now and then he looked at Aglaya for five minutes at a time, without
taking his eyes off her face; but his expression was very strange;
he would gaze at her as though she were an object a couple of miles
distant, or as though he were looking at her portrait and not at herself
at all."
"“Why do you look at me like that, prince?” she asked suddenly, breaking
off her merry conversation and laughter with those about her."
"“I’m
afraid of you!"
"You look as though you were just going to put out
your hand and touch my face to see if it’s real!"
"Doesn’t he, Evgenie
Pavlovitch--doesn’t he look like that?”

The prince seemed surprised that he should have been addressed at all;
he reflected a moment, but did not seem to take in what had been said
to him; at all events, he did not answer."
"But observing that she and
the others had begun to laugh, he too opened his mouth and laughed with
them."
"The laughter became general, and the young officer, who seemed a
particularly lively sort of person, simply shook with mirth."
"Aglaya suddenly whispered angrily to herself the word--

“Idiot!”

“My goodness--surely she is not in love with such a--surely she isn’t
mad!” groaned Mrs. Epanchin, under her breath."
"“It’s all a joke, mamma; it’s just a joke like the ‘poor
knight’--nothing more whatever, I assure you!” Alexandra whispered
in her ear."
"“She is chaffing him--making a fool of him, after her
own private fashion, that’s all!"
"But she carries it just a little
too far--she is a regular little actress."
"How she frightened us just
now--didn’t she?--and all for a lark!”

“Well, it’s lucky she has happened upon an idiot, then, that’s all I
can say!” whispered Lizabetha Prokofievna, who was somewhat comforted,
however, by her daughter’s remark."
"The prince had heard himself referred to as “idiot,” and had shuddered
at the moment; but his shudder, it so happened, was not caused by the
word applied to him."
"The fact was that in the crowd, not far from where
he was sitting, a pale familiar face, with curly black hair, and a
well-known smile and expression, had flashed across his vision for a
moment, and disappeared again."
Very likely he had imagined it!
"There
only remained to him the impression of a strange smile, two eyes, and
a bright green tie."
"Whether the man had disappeared among the crowd, or
whether he had turned towards the Vauxhall, the prince could not say."
But a moment or two afterwards he began to glance keenly about him.
"That
first vision might only too likely be the forerunner of a second; it was
almost certain to be so."
"Surely he had not forgotten the possibility
of such a meeting when he came to the Vauxhall?"
"True enough, he had not
remarked where he was coming to when he set out with Aglaya; he had not
been in a condition to remark anything at all."
"Had he been more careful to observe his companion, he would have seen
that for the last quarter of an hour Aglaya had also been glancing
around in apparent anxiety, as though she expected to see someone, or
something particular, among the crowd of people."
"Now, at the moment when
his own anxiety became so marked, her excitement also increased visibly,
and when he looked about him, she did the same."
The reason for their anxiety soon became apparent.
"From that very side
entrance to the Vauxhall, near which the prince and all the Epanchin
party were seated, there suddenly appeared quite a large knot of
persons, at least a dozen."
"Heading this little band walked three ladies, two of whom were
remarkably lovely; and there was nothing surprising in the fact that
they should have had a large troop of admirers following in their wake."
"But there was something in the appearance of both the ladies and their
admirers which was peculiar, quite different for that of the rest of the
public assembled around the orchestra."
"Nearly everyone observed the little band advancing, and all pretended
not to see or notice them, except a few young fellows who exchanged
glances and smiled, saying something to one another in whispers."
"It was impossible to avoid noticing them, however, in reality, for they
made their presence only too conspicuous by laughing and talking loudly."
"It was to be supposed that some of them were more than half drunk,
although they were well enough dressed, some even particularly well."
"There were one or two, however, who were very strange-looking creatures,
with flushed faces and extraordinary clothes; some were military men;
not all were quite young; one or two were middle-aged gentlemen of
decidedly disagreeable appearance, men who are avoided in society like
the plague, decked out in large gold studs and rings, and magnificently
“got up,” generally."
"Among our suburban resorts there are some which enjoy a specially
high reputation for respectability and fashion; but the most careful
individual is not absolutely exempt from the danger of a tile falling
suddenly upon his head from his neighbour’s roof."
"Such a tile was about to descend upon the elegant and decorous public
now assembled to hear the music."
"In order to pass from the Vauxhall to the band-stand, the visitor has
to descend two or three steps."
"Just at these steps the group paused, as
though it feared to proceed further; but very quickly one of the three
ladies, who formed its apex, stepped forward into the charmed circle,
followed by two members of her suite."
"One of these was a middle-aged man of very respectable appearance, but
with the stamp of parvenu upon him, a man whom nobody knew, and who
evidently knew nobody."
"The other follower was younger and far less
respectable-looking."
"No one else followed the eccentric lady; but as she descended the steps
she did not even look behind her, as though it were absolutely the same
to her whether anyone were following or not."
"She laughed and talked
loudly, however, just as before."
"She was dressed with great taste, but
with rather more magnificence than was needed for the occasion, perhaps."
"She walked past the orchestra, to where an open carriage was waiting,
near the road."
The prince had not seen _her_ for more than three months.
"All these days
since his arrival from Petersburg he had intended to pay her a visit,
but some mysterious presentiment had restrained him."
"He could not
picture to himself what impression this meeting with her would make upon
him, though he had often tried to imagine it, with fear and trembling."
"One fact was quite certain, and that was that the meeting would be
painful."
"Several times during the last six months he had recalled the effect
which the first sight of this face had had upon him, when he only saw
its portrait."
"He recollected well that even the portrait face had left
but too painful an impression."
"That month in the provinces, when he had seen this woman nearly every
day, had affected him so deeply that he could not now look back upon
it calmly."
"In the very look of this woman there was something which
tortured him."
"In conversation with Rogojin he had attributed this
sensation to pity--immeasurable pity, and this was the truth."
"The sight
of the portrait face alone had filled his heart full of the agony of
real sympathy; and this feeling of sympathy, nay, of actual _suffering_,
for her, had never left his heart since that hour, and was still in full
force."
"Oh yes, and more powerful than ever!"
But the prince was not satisfied with what he had said to Rogojin.
"Only
at this moment, when she suddenly made her appearance before him, did
he realize to the full the exact emotion which she called up in him, and
which he had not described correctly to Rogojin."
"And, indeed, there were no words in which he could have expressed his
horror, yes, _horror_, for he was now fully convinced from his own private
knowledge of her, that the woman was mad."
"If, loving a woman above everything in the world, or at least having a
foretaste of the possibility of such love for her, one were suddenly to
behold her on a chain, behind bars and under the lash of a keeper, one
would feel something like what the poor prince now felt."
"“What’s the matter?” asked Aglaya, in a whisper, giving his sleeve a
little tug."
"He turned his head towards her and glanced at her black and (for some
reason) flashing eyes, tried to smile, and then, apparently forgetting
her in an instant, turned to the right once more, and continued to watch
the startling apparition before him."
Nastasia Philipovna was at this moment passing the young ladies’ chairs.
"Evgenie Pavlovitch continued some apparently extremely funny and
interesting anecdote to Alexandra, speaking quickly and with much
animation."
"The prince remembered that at this moment Aglaya remarked in
a half-whisper:

“_What_ a--”

She did not finish her indefinite sentence; she restrained herself in a
moment; but it was enough."
"Nastasia Philipovna, who up to now had been walking along as though she
had not noticed the Epanchin party, suddenly turned her head in their
direction, as though she had just observed Evgenie Pavlovitch sitting
there for the first time."
"“Why, I declare, here he is!” she cried, stopping suddenly."
"“The man one
can’t find with all one’s messengers sent about the place, sitting just
under one’s nose, exactly where one never thought of looking!"
"I thought
you were sure to be at your uncle’s by this time.”

Evgenie Pavlovitch flushed up and looked angrily at Nastasia Philipovna,
then turned his back on her."
“What!
don’t you know about it yet?
He doesn’t know--imagine that!
"Why,
he’s shot himself."
Your uncle shot himself this very morning.
"I was told
at two this afternoon."
Half the town must know it by now.
"They say there
are three hundred and fifty thousand roubles, government money, missing;
some say five hundred thousand."
"And I was under the impression that he
would leave you a fortune!"
He’s whistled it all away.
"A most depraved
old gentleman, really!"
"Well, ta, ta!--bonne chance!"
"Surely you intend
to be off there, don’t you?"
"Ha, ha!"
"You’ve retired from the army in good
time, I see!"
Plain clothes!
"Well done, sly rogue!"
Nonsense!
"I see--you
knew it all before--I dare say you knew all about it yesterday-”

Although the impudence of this attack, this public proclamation of
intimacy, as it were, was doubtless premeditated, and had its special
object, yet Evgenie Pavlovitch at first seemed to intend to make no
show of observing either his tormentor or her words."
"But Nastasia’s
communication struck him with the force of a thunderclap."
"On hearing
of his uncle’s death he suddenly grew as white as a sheet, and turned
towards his informant."
"At this moment, Lizabetha Prokofievna rose swiftly from her seat,
beckoned her companions, and left the place almost at a run."
"Only the prince stopped behind for a moment, as though in indecision;
and Evgenie Pavlovitch lingered too, for he had not collected his
scattered wits."
"But the Epanchins had not had time to get more than
twenty paces away when a scandalous episode occurred."
"The young officer,
Evgenie Pavlovitch’s friend who had been conversing with Aglaya, said
aloud in a great state of indignation:

“She ought to be whipped--that’s the only way to deal with creatures
like that--she ought to be whipped!”

This gentleman was a confidant of Evgenie’s, and had doubtless heard of
the carriage episode."
Nastasia turned to him.
"Her eyes flashed; she rushed up to a young man
standing near, whom she did not know in the least, but who happened to
have in his hand a thin cane."
"Seizing this from him, she brought it with
all her force across the face of her insulter."
"All this occurred, of course, in one instant of time."
"The young officer, forgetting himself, sprang towards her."
"Nastasia’s
followers were not by her at the moment (the elderly gentleman having
disappeared altogether, and the younger man simply standing aside and
roaring with laughter)."
"In another moment, of course, the police would have been on the spot,
and it would have gone hard with Nastasia Philipovna had not unexpected
aid appeared."
"Muishkin, who was but a couple of steps away, had time to spring forward
and seize the officer’s arms from behind."
"The officer, tearing himself from the prince’s grasp, pushed him so
violently backwards that he staggered a few steps and then subsided into
a chair."
But there were other defenders for Nastasia on the spot by this time.
The gentleman known as the “boxer” now confronted the enraged officer.
"“Keller is my name, sir; ex-lieutenant,” he said, very loud."
"“If you
will accept me as champion of the fair sex, I am at your disposal."
English boxing has no secrets from me.
"I sympathize with you for the
insult you have received, but I can’t permit you to raise your hand
against a woman in public."
"If you prefer to meet me--as would be more
fitting to your rank--in some other manner, of course you understand me,
captain.”

But the young officer had recovered himself, and was no longer
listening."
"At this moment Rogojin appeared, elbowing through the crowd;
he took Nastasia’s hand, drew it through his arm, and quickly led her
away."
"He appeared to be terribly excited; he was trembling all over,
and was as pale as a corpse."
"As he carried Nastasia off, he turned and
grinned horribly in the officer’s face, and with low malice observed:

“Tfu!"
look what the fellow got!
Look at the blood on his cheek!
"Ha, ha!”

Recollecting himself, however, and seeing at a glance the sort of people
he had to deal with, the officer turned his back on both his opponents,
and courteously, but concealing his face with his handkerchief,
approached the prince, who was now rising from the chair into which he
had fallen."
"“Prince Muishkin, I believe?"
"The gentleman to whom I had the honour of
being introduced?”

“She is mad, insane--I assure you, she is mad,” replied the prince in
trembling tones, holding out both his hands mechanically towards the
officer."
"“I cannot boast of any such knowledge, of course, but I wished to know
your name.”

He bowed and retired without waiting for an answer."
"Five seconds after the disappearance of the last actor in this scene,
the police arrived."
"The whole episode had not lasted more than a couple
of minutes."
"Some of the spectators had risen from their places, and
departed altogether; some merely exchanged their seats for others a
little further off; some were delighted with the occurrence, and talked
and laughed over it for a long time."
"In a word, the incident closed as such incidents do, and the band began
to play again."
The prince walked away after the Epanchin party.
"Had
he thought of looking round to the left after he had been pushed so
unceremoniously into the chair, he would have observed Aglaya standing
some twenty yards away."
"She had stayed to watch the scandalous scene in
spite of her mother’s and sisters’ anxious cries to her to come away."
"Prince S. ran up to her and persuaded her, at last, to come home with
them."
"Lizabetha Prokofievna saw that she returned in such a state of agitation
that it was doubtful whether she had even heard their calls."
"But only a
couple of minutes later, when they had reached the park, Aglaya suddenly
remarked, in her usual calm, indifferent voice:

“I wanted to see how the farce would end.”

III."
"The occurrence at the Vauxhall had filled both mother and daughters with
something like horror."
"In their excitement Lizabetha Prokofievna and the
girls were nearly running all the way home."
"In her opinion there was so much disclosed and laid bare by the episode,
that, in spite of the chaotic condition of her mind, she was able to
feel more or less decided on certain points which, up to now, had been
in a cloudy condition."
"However, one and all of the party realized that something important
had happened, and that, perhaps fortunately enough, something which had
hitherto been enveloped in the obscurity of guess-work had now begun to
come forth a little from the mists."
"In spite of Prince S.’s assurances
and explanations, Evgenie Pavlovitch’s real character and position were
at last coming to light."
"He was publicly convicted of intimacy with
“that creature.” So thought Lizabetha Prokofievna and her two elder
daughters."
"But the real upshot of the business was that the number of riddles to
be solved was augmented."
"The two girls, though rather irritated at their
mother’s exaggerated alarm and haste to depart from the scene, had been
unwilling to worry her at first with questions."
"Besides, they could not help thinking that their sister Aglaya probably
knew more about the whole matter than both they and their mother put
together."
"Prince S. looked as black as night, and was silent and moody."
"Mrs.
Epanchin did not say a word to him all the way home, and he did not seem
to observe the fact."
"Adelaida tried to pump him a little by asking, “who
was the uncle they were talking about, and what was it that had happened
in Petersburg?” But he had merely muttered something disconnected about
“making inquiries,” and that “of course it was all nonsense.” “Oh, of
course,” replied Adelaida, and asked no more questions."
"Aglaya, too, was
very quiet; and the only remark she made on the way home was that they
were “walking much too fast to be pleasant.”

Once she turned and observed the prince hurrying after them."
"Noticing
his anxiety to catch them up, she smiled ironically, and then looked
back no more."
"At length, just as they neared the house, General Epanchin
came out and met them; he had only just arrived from town."
His first word was to inquire after Evgenie Pavlovitch.
"But Lizabetha
stalked past him, and neither looked at him nor answered his question."
"He immediately judged from the faces of his daughters and Prince S. that
there was a thunderstorm brewing, and he himself already bore evidences
of unusual perturbation of mind."
"He immediately button-holed Prince S., and standing at the front door,
engaged in a whispered conversation with him."
"By the troubled aspect of
both of them, when they entered the house, and approached Mrs. Epanchin,
it was evident that they had been discussing very disturbing news."
"Little by little the family gathered together upstairs in Lizabetha
Prokofievna’s apartments, and Prince Muishkin found himself alone on
the verandah when he arrived."
"He settled himself in a corner and sat
waiting, though he knew not what he expected."
"It never struck him that
he had better go away, with all this disturbance in the house."
"He seemed
to have forgotten all the world, and to be ready to sit on where he was
for years on end."
"From upstairs he caught sounds of excited conversation
every now and then."
He could not say how long he sat there.
"It grew late and became quite
dark."
Suddenly Aglaya entered the verandah.
"She seemed to be quite calm,
though a little pale."
"Observing the prince, whom she evidently did not expect to see there,
alone in the corner, she smiled, and approached him:

“What are you doing there?” she asked."
"The prince muttered something, blushed, and jumped up; but Aglaya
immediately sat down beside him; so he reseated himself."
"She looked suddenly, but attentively into his face, then at the window,
as though thinking of something else, and then again at him."
"“Perhaps she wants to laugh at me,” thought the prince, “but no; for if
she did she certainly would do so.”

“Would you like some tea?"
"I’ll order some,” she said, after a minute or
two of silence."
"“N-no thanks, I don’t know--”

“Don’t know!"
How can you not know?
"By-the-by, look here--if someone
were to challenge you to a duel, what should you do?"
"I wished to ask you
this--some time ago--”

“Why?"
"Nobody would ever challenge me to a duel!”

“But if they were to, would you be dreadfully frightened?”

“I dare say I should be--much alarmed!”

“Seriously?"
"Then are you a coward?”

“N-no!--I don’t think so."
"A coward is a man who is afraid and runs away;
the man who is frightened but does not run away, is not quite a coward,”
 said the prince with a smile, after a moment’s thought."
"“And you wouldn’t run away?”

“No--I don’t think I should run away,” replied the prince, laughing
outright at last at Aglaya’s questions."
"“Though I am a woman, I should certainly not run away for anything,”
 said Aglaya, in a slightly pained voice."
"“However, I see you are
laughing at me and twisting your face up as usual in order to make
yourself look more interesting."
"Now tell me, they generally shoot at
twenty paces, don’t they?"
"At ten, sometimes?"
"I suppose if at ten they
must be either wounded or killed, mustn’t they?”

“I don’t think they often kill each other at duels.”

“They killed Pushkin that way.”

“That may have been an accident.”

“Not a bit of it; it was a duel to the death, and he was killed.”

“The bullet struck so low down that probably his antagonist would never
have aimed at that part of him--people never do; he would have aimed at
his chest or head; so that probably the bullet hit him accidentally."
"I
have been told this by competent authorities.”

“Well, a soldier once told me that they were always ordered to aim at
the middle of the body."
"So you see they don’t aim at the chest or head;
they aim lower on purpose."
"I asked some officer about this afterwards,
and he said it was perfectly true.”

“That is probably when they fire from a long distance.”

“Can you shoot at all?”

“No, I have never shot in my life.”

“Can’t you even load a pistol?”

“No!"
"That is, I understand how it’s done, of course, but I have never
done it.”

“Then, you don’t know how, for it is a matter that needs practice."
"Now
listen and learn; in the first place buy good powder, not damp (they say
it mustn’t be at all damp, but very dry), some fine kind it is--you must
ask for _pistol_ powder, not the stuff they load cannons with."
"They say
one makes the bullets oneself, somehow or other."
"Have you got a pistol?”

“No--and I don’t want one,” said the prince, laughing."
"“Oh, what _nonsense!_ You must buy one."
"French or English are the best,
they say."
"Then take a little powder, about a thimbleful, or perhaps two,
and pour it into the barrel."
Better put plenty.
"Then push in a bit of
felt (it _must_ be felt, for some reason or other); you can easily get
a bit off some old mattress, or off a door; it’s used to keep the cold
out."
"Well, when you have pushed the felt down, put the bullet in; do you
hear now?"
"The bullet last and the powder first, not the other way, or
the pistol won’t shoot."
What are you laughing at?
"I wish you to buy
a pistol and practise every day, and you must learn to hit a mark for
_certain_; will you?”

The prince only laughed."
Aglaya stamped her foot with annoyance.
"Her serious air, however, during this conversation had surprised him
considerably."
"He had a feeling that he ought to be asking her something,
that there was something he wanted to find out far more important than
how to load a pistol; but his thoughts had all scattered, and he was
only aware that she was sitting by him, and talking to him, and that
he was looking at her; as to what she happened to be saying to him, that
did not matter in the least."
"The general now appeared on the verandah, coming from upstairs."
"He was
on his way out, with an expression of determination on his face, and of
preoccupation and worry also."
“Ah!
"Lef Nicolaievitch, it’s you, is it?"
"Where are you off to now?” he
asked, oblivious of the fact that the prince had not showed the least
sign of moving."
"“Come along with me; I want to say a word or two to
you.”

“_Au revoir_, then!” said Aglaya, holding out her hand to the prince."
"It was quite dark now, and Muishkin could not see her face clearly, but
a minute or two later, when he and the general had left the villa, he
suddenly flushed up, and squeezed his right hand tightly."
It appeared that he and the general were going in the same direction.
"In
spite of the lateness of the hour, the general was hurrying away to talk
to someone upon some important subject."
"Meanwhile he talked incessantly
but disconnectedly to the prince, and continually brought in the name of
Lizabetha Prokofievna."
"If the prince had been in a condition to pay more attention to what
the general was saying, he would have discovered that the latter was
desirous of drawing some information out of him, or indeed of asking him
some question outright; but that he could not make up his mind to come
to the point."
"Muishkin was so absent, that from the very first he could not attend
to a word the other was saying; and when the general suddenly stopped
before him with some excited question, he was obliged to confess,
ignominiously, that he did not know in the least what he had been
talking about."
The general shrugged his shoulders.
"“How strange everyone, yourself included, has become of late,” said
he."
"“I was telling you that I cannot in the least understand Lizabetha
Prokofievna’s ideas and agitations."
"She is in hysterics up there, and
moans and says that we have been ‘shamed and disgraced.’ How?"
Why?
When?
By whom?
"I confess that I am very much to blame myself; I do not conceal
the fact; but the conduct, the outrageous behaviour of this woman, must
really be kept within limits, by the police if necessary, and I am just
on my way now to talk the question over and make some arrangements."
"It can all be managed quietly and gently, even kindly, and without the
slightest fuss or scandal."
"I foresee that the future is pregnant with
events, and that there is much that needs explanation."
"There is intrigue
in the wind; but if on one side nothing is known, on the other side
nothing will be explained."
"If I have heard nothing about it, nor have
_you_, nor _he_, nor _she_--who _has_ heard about it, I should like to
know?"
"How _can_ all this be explained except by the fact that half of
it is mirage or moonshine, or some hallucination of that sort?”

“_She_ is insane,” muttered the prince, suddenly recollecting all that had
passed, with a spasm of pain at his heart."
"“I too had that idea, and I slept in peace."
"But now I see that their
opinion is more correct."
I do not believe in the theory of madness!
"The
woman has no common sense; but she is not only not insane, she is artful
to a degree."
"Her outburst of this evening about Evgenie’s uncle proves
that conclusively."
"It was _villainous_, simply jesuitical, and it was all
for some special purpose.”

“What about Evgenie’s uncle?”

“My goodness, Lef Nicolaievitch, why, you can’t have heard a single
word I said!"
"Look at me, I’m still trembling all over with the dreadful
shock!"
It is that that kept me in town so late.
"Evgenie Pavlovitch’s
uncle--”

“Well?” cried the prince."
"“Shot himself this morning, at seven o’clock."
"A respected, eminent old
man of seventy; and exactly point for point as she described it; a sum
of money, a considerable sum of government money, missing!”

“Why, how could she--”

“What, know of it?"
"Ha, ha, ha!"
"Why, there was a whole crowd round her
the moment she appeared on the scenes here."
"You know what sort of people
surround her nowadays, and solicit the honour of her ‘acquaintance.’
Of course she might easily have heard the news from someone coming from
town."
"All Petersburg, if not all Pavlofsk, knows it by now."
"Look at the
slyness of her observation about Evgenie’s uniform!"
"I mean, her remark
that he had retired just in time!"
"There’s a venomous hint for you,
if you like!"
"No, no!"
there’s no insanity there!
"Of course I refuse
to believe that Evgenie Pavlovitch could have known beforehand of the
catastrophe; that is, that at such and such a day at seven o’clock, and
all that; but he might well have had a presentiment of the truth."
"And
I--all of us--Prince S. and everybody, believed that he was to inherit
a large fortune from this uncle."
"It’s dreadful, horrible!"
"Mind, I don’t
suspect Evgenie of anything, be quite clear on that point; but the
thing is a little suspicious, nevertheless."
Prince S. can’t get over it.
"Altogether it is a very extraordinary combination of circumstances.”

“What suspicion attaches to Evgenie Pavlovitch?”

“Oh, none at all!"
He has behaved very well indeed.
"I didn’t mean to
drop any sort of hint."
"His own fortune is intact, I believe."
"Lizabetha
Prokofievna, of course, refuses to listen to anything."
"That’s the worst
of it all, these family catastrophes or quarrels, or whatever you like
to call them."
"You know, prince, you are a friend of the family, so I
don’t mind telling you; it now appears that Evgenie Pavlovitch proposed
to Aglaya a month ago, and was refused.”

“Impossible!” cried the prince."
“Why?
Do you know anything about it?
"Look here,” continued the general,
more agitated than ever, and trembling with excitement, “maybe I have
been letting the cat out of the bag too freely with you, if so, it
is because you are--that sort of man, you know!"
"Perhaps you have some
special information?”

“I know nothing about Evgenie Pavlovitch!” said the prince."
“Nor do I!
"They always try to bury me underground when there’s anything
going on; they don’t seem to reflect that it is unpleasant to a man
to be treated so!"
I won’t stand it!
"We have just had a terrible
scene!--mind, I speak to you as I would to my own son!"
"Aglaya laughs at
her mother."
"Her sisters guessed about Evgenie having proposed and been
rejected, and told Lizabetha."
"“I tell you, my dear fellow, Aglaya is such an extraordinary, such a
self-willed, fantastical little creature, you wouldn’t believe it!"
"Every
high quality, every brilliant trait of heart and mind, are to be
found in her, and, with it all, so much caprice and mockery, such wild
fancies--indeed, a little devil!"
"She has just been laughing at her
mother to her very face, and at her sisters, and at Prince S., and
everybody--and of course she always laughs at me!"
"You know I love the
child--I love her even when she laughs at me, and I believe the wild
little creature has a special fondness for me for that very reason."
"She
is fonder of me than any of the others."
"I dare swear she has had a
good laugh at _you_ before now!"
"You were having a quiet talk just now, I
observed, after all the thunder and lightning upstairs."
"She was sitting
with you just as though there had been no row at all.”

The prince blushed painfully in the darkness, and closed his right hand
tightly, but he said nothing."
"“My dear good Prince Lef Nicolaievitch,” began the general again,
suddenly, “both I and Lizabetha Prokofievna--(who has begun to respect
you once more, and me through you, goodness knows why!)"
"--we both love
you very sincerely, and esteem you, in spite of any appearances to the
contrary."
"But you’ll admit what a riddle it must have been for us when
that calm, cold, little spitfire, Aglaya--(for she stood up to her
mother and answered her questions with inexpressible contempt, and mine
still more so, because, like a fool, I thought it my duty to assert
myself as head of the family)--when Aglaya stood up of a sudden and
informed us that ‘that madwoman’ (strangely enough, she used exactly the
same expression as you did) ‘has taken it into her head to marry me
to Prince Lef Nicolaievitch, and therefore is doing her best to choke
Evgenie Pavlovitch off, and rid the house of him.’ That’s what she said."
"She would not give the slightest explanation; she burst out laughing,
banged the door, and went away."
We all stood there with our mouths open.
"Well, I was told afterwards of your little passage with Aglaya this
afternoon, and--and--dear prince--you are a good, sensible fellow, don’t
be angry if I speak out--she is laughing at you, my boy!"
"She is enjoying
herself like a child, at your expense, and therefore, since she is a
child, don’t be angry with her, and don’t think anything of it."
"I assure
you, she is simply making a fool of you, just as she does with one and
all of us out of pure lack of something better to do."
Well--good-bye!
"You know our feelings, don’t you--our sincere feelings for yourself?"
"They are unalterable, you know, dear boy, under all circumstances,
but--Well, here we part; I must go down to the right."
"Rarely have I sat
so uncomfortably in my saddle, as they say, as I now sit."
"And people
talk of the charms of a country holiday!”

Left to himself at the cross-roads, the prince glanced around him,
quickly crossed the road towards the lighted window of a neighbouring
house, and unfolded a tiny scrap of paper which he had held clasped in
his right hand during the whole of his conversation with the general."
He read the note in the uncertain rays that fell from the window.
"It was
as follows:

“Tomorrow morning, I shall be at the green bench in the park at seven,
and shall wait there for you."
"I have made up my mind to speak to you
about a most important matter which closely concerns yourself."
“P.S.--I trust that you will not show this note to anyone.
"Though I
am ashamed of giving you such instructions, I feel that I must do so,
considering what you are."
"I therefore write the words, and blush for
your simple character."
“P.P.S.--It is the same green bench that I showed you before.
There!
aren’t you ashamed of yourself?
"I felt that it was necessary to repeat
even that information.”

The note was written and folded anyhow, evidently in a great hurry, and
probably just before Aglaya had come down to the verandah."
"In inexpressible agitation, amounting almost to fear, the prince slipped
quickly away from the window, away from the light, like a frightened
thief, but as he did so he collided violently with some gentleman who
seemed to spring from the earth at his feet."
"“I was watching for you, prince,” said the individual."
"“Is that you, Keller?” said the prince, in surprise."
"“Yes, I’ve been looking for you."
"I waited for you at the Epanchins’
house, but of course I could not come in."
"I dogged you from behind
as you walked along with the general."
"Well, prince, here is Keller,
absolutely at your service--command him!--ready to sacrifice
himself--even to die in case of need.”

“But--why?”

“Oh, why?--Of course you’ll be challenged!"
"That was young Lieutenant
Moloftsoff."
"I know him, or rather of him; he won’t pass an insult."
"He
will take no notice of Rogojin and myself, and, therefore, you are the
only one left to account for."
"You’ll have to pay the piper, prince."
"He
has been asking about you, and undoubtedly his friend will call on you
tomorrow--perhaps he is at your house already."
"If you would do me the
honour to have me for a second, prince, I should be happy."
"That’s why I
have been looking for you now.”

“Duel!"
"You’ve come to talk about a duel, too!” The prince burst
out laughing, to the great astonishment of Keller."
"He laughed
unrestrainedly, and Keller, who had been on pins and needles, and in a
fever of excitement to offer himself as “second,” was very near being
offended."
"“You caught him by the arms, you know, prince."
"No man of proper pride
can stand that sort of treatment in public.”

“Yes, and he gave me a fearful dig in the chest,” cried the prince,
still laughing."
“What are we to fight about?
"I shall beg his pardon,
that’s all."
But if we must fight--we’ll fight!
"Let him have a shot at
me, by all means; I should rather like it."
"Ha, ha, ha!"
"I know how to
load a pistol now; do you know how to load a pistol, Keller?"
"First, you
have to buy the powder, you know; it mustn’t be wet, and it mustn’t be
that coarse stuff that they load cannons with--it must be pistol powder."
"Then you pour the powder in, and get hold of a bit of felt from some
door, and then shove the bullet in."
"But don’t shove the bullet in before
the powder, because the thing wouldn’t go off--do you hear, Keller, the
thing wouldn’t go off!"
"Ha, ha, ha!"
"Isn’t that a grand reason, Keller,
my friend, eh?"
"Do you know, my dear fellow, I really must kiss you, and
embrace you, this very moment."
"Ha, ha!"
"How was it you so suddenly popped
up in front of me as you did?"
"Come to my house as soon as you can, and
we’ll have some champagne."
We’ll all get drunk!
"Do you know I have a
dozen of champagne in Lebedeff’s cellar?"
"Lebedeff sold them to me the
day after I arrived."
I took the lot.
We’ll invite everybody!
"Are you
going to do any sleeping tonight?”

“As much as usual, prince--why?”

“Pleasant dreams then--ha, ha!”

The prince crossed the road, and disappeared into the park, leaving the
astonished Keller in a state of ludicrous wonder."
"He had never before
seen the prince in such a strange condition of mind, and could not have
imagined the possibility of it."
"“Fever, probably,” he said to himself, “for the man is all nerves, and
this business has been a little too much for him."
"He is not _afraid_,
that’s clear; that sort never funks!"
H’m!
champagne!
"That was an
interesting item of news, at all events!--Twelve bottles!"
"Dear me,
that’s a very respectable little stock indeed!"
"I bet anything Lebedeff
lent somebody money on deposit of this dozen of champagne."
Hum!
"he’s a
nice fellow, is this prince!"
I like this sort of man.
"Well, I needn’t be
wasting time here, and if it’s a case of champagne, why--there’s no time
like the present!”

That the prince was almost in a fever was no more than the truth."
"He
wandered about the park for a long while, and at last came to himself in
a lonely avenue."
"He was vaguely conscious that he had already paced this
particular walk--from that large, dark tree to the bench at the other
end--about a hundred yards altogether--at least thirty times backwards
and forwards."
"As to recollecting what he had been thinking of all that time, he could
not."
"He caught himself, however, indulging in one thought which made him
roar with laughter, though there was nothing really to laugh at in it;
but he felt that he must laugh, and go on laughing."
"It struck him that the idea of the duel might not have occurred to
Keller alone, but that his lesson in the art of pistol-loading might
have been not altogether accidental!"
“Pooh!
"nonsense!” he said to
himself, struck by another thought, of a sudden."
"“Why, she was immensely
surprised to find me there on the verandah, and laughed and talked about
_tea!_ And yet she had this little note in her hand, therefore she must
have known that I was sitting there."
So why was she surprised?
"Ha, ha,
ha!”

He pulled the note out and kissed it; then paused and reflected."
"“How
strange it all is!"
"how strange!” he muttered, melancholy enough now."
"In
moments of great joy, he invariably felt a sensation of melancholy come
over him--he could not tell why."
"He looked intently around him, and wondered why he had come here; he was
very tired, so he approached the bench and sat down on it."
"Around him
was profound silence; the music in the Vauxhall was over."
"The park
seemed quite empty, though it was not, in reality, later than half-past
eleven."
"It was a quiet, warm, clear night--a real Petersburg night of
early June; but in the dense avenue, where he was sitting, it was almost
pitch dark."
"If anyone had come up at this moment and told him that he was in love,
passionately in love, he would have rejected the idea with astonishment,
and, perhaps, with irritation."
"And if anyone had added that Aglaya’s
note was a love-letter, and that it contained an appointment to a
lover’s rendezvous, he would have blushed with shame for the speaker,
and, probably, have challenged him to a duel."
All this would have been perfectly sincere on his part.
"He had never
for a moment entertained the idea of the possibility of this girl loving
him, or even of such a thing as himself falling in love with her."
"The
possibility of being loved himself, “a man like me,” as he put it, he
ranked among ridiculous suppositions."
"It appeared to him that it was
simply a joke on Aglaya’s part, if there really were anything in it at
all; but that seemed to him quite natural."
"His preoccupation was caused
by something different."
"As to the few words which the general had let slip about Aglaya laughing
at everybody, and at himself most of all--he entirely believed them."
"He
did not feel the slightest sensation of offence; on the contrary, he was
quite certain that it was as it should be."
"His whole thoughts were now as to next morning early; he would see
her; he would sit by her on that little green bench, and listen to how
pistols were loaded, and look at her."
He wanted nothing more.
"The question as to what she might have to say of special interest to
himself occurred to him once or twice."
"He did not doubt, for a moment,
that she really had some such subject of conversation in store, but so
very little interested in the matter was he that it did not strike him
to wonder what it could be."
"The crunch of gravel on the path suddenly
caused him to raise his head."
"A man, whose face it was difficult to see in the gloom, approached the
bench, and sat down beside him."
"The prince peered into his face, and
recognized the livid features of Rogojin."
“I knew you’d be wandering about somewhere here.
"I didn’t have to look
for you very long,” muttered the latter between his teeth."
"It was the first time they had met since the encounter on the staircase
at the hotel."
"Painfully surprised as he was at this sudden apparition of Rogojin,
the prince, for some little while, was unable to collect his thoughts."
"Rogojin, evidently, saw and understood the impression he had made; and
though he seemed more or less confused at first, yet he began talking
with what looked like assumed ease and freedom."
"However, the prince soon
changed his mind on this score, and thought that there was not only no
affectation of indifference, but that Rogojin was not even particularly
agitated."
"If there were a little apparent awkwardness, it was only in
his words and gestures."
The man could not change his heart.
"“How did you--find me here?” asked the prince for the sake of saying
something."
“Keller told me (I found him at your place) that you were in the park.
"‘Of course he is!’ I thought.”

“Why so?” asked the prince uneasily."
"Rogojin smiled, but did not explain."
"“I received your letter, Lef Nicolaievitch--what’s the good of all
that?--It’s no use, you know."
"I’ve come to you from _her_,--she bade me
tell you that she must see you, she has something to say to you."
"She
told me to find you today.”

“I’ll come tomorrow."
"Now I’m going home--are you coming to my house?”

“Why should I?"
"I’ve given you the message.--Goodbye!”

“Won’t you come?” asked the prince in a gentle voice."
“What an extraordinary man you are!
"I wonder at you!” Rogojin laughed
sarcastically."
"“Why do you hate me so?” asked the prince, sadly."
"“You know yourself
that all you suspected is quite unfounded."
"I felt you were still angry
with me, though."
Do you know why?
"Because you tried to kill me--that’s
why you can’t shake off your wrath against me."
"I tell you that I only
remember the Parfen Rogojin with whom I exchanged crosses, and vowed
brotherhood."
"I wrote you this in yesterday’s letter, in order that you
might forget all that madness on your part, and that you might not feel
called to talk about it when we met."
Why do you avoid me?
"Why do you
hold your hand back from me?"
"I tell you again, I consider all that has
passed a delirium, an insane dream."
"I can understand all you did,
and all you felt that day, as if it were myself."
"What you were then
imagining was not the case, and could never be the case."
"Why, then,
should there be anger between us?”

“You don’t know what anger is!” laughed Rogojin, in reply to the
prince’s heated words."
"He had moved a pace or two away, and was hiding his hands behind him."
"“No, it is impossible for me to come to your house again,” he added
slowly."
“Why?
"Do you hate me so much as all that?”

“I don’t love you, Lef Nicolaievitch, and, therefore, what would be
the use of my coming to see you?"
"You are just like a child--you want a
plaything, and it must be taken out and given you--and then you don’t
know how to work it."
"You are simply repeating all you said in your
letter, and what’s the use?"
"Of course I believe every word you say, and
I know perfectly well that you neither did or ever can deceive me in
any way, and yet, I don’t love you."
"You write that you’ve forgotten
everything, and only remember your brother Parfen, with whom you
exchanged crosses, and that you don’t remember anything about the
Rogojin who aimed a knife at your throat."
"What do you know about my
feelings, eh?” (Rogojin laughed disagreeably.)"
"“Here you are holding out
your brotherly forgiveness to me for a thing that I have perhaps never
repented of in the slightest degree."
"I did not think of it again all
that evening; all my thoughts were centred on something else--”

“Not think of it again?"
Of course you didn’t!” cried the prince.
"“And I
dare swear that you came straight away down here to Pavlofsk to listen
to the music and dog her about in the crowd, and stare at her, just as
you did today."
There’s nothing surprising in that!
"If you hadn’t been in
that condition of mind that you could think of nothing but one subject,
you would, probably, never have raised your knife against me."
"I had a
presentiment of what you would do, that day, ever since I saw you first
in the morning."
Do you know yourself what you looked like?
"I knew
you would try to murder me even at the very moment when we exchanged
crosses."
What did you take me to your mother for?
"Did you think to stay
your hand by doing so?"
"Perhaps you did not put your thoughts into words,
but you and I were thinking the same thing, or feeling the same thing
looming over us, at the same moment."
"What should you think of me now if
you had not raised your knife to me--the knife which God averted from my
throat?"
"I would have been guilty of suspecting you all the same--and you
would have intended the murder all the same; therefore we should have
been mutually guilty in any case."
"Come, don’t frown; you needn’t laugh
at me, either."
You say you haven’t ‘repented.’ Repented!
"You probably
couldn’t, if you were to try; you dislike me too much for that."
"Why,
if I were an angel of light, and as innocent before you as a babe, you
would still loathe me if you believed that _she_ loved me, instead of
loving yourself."
That’s jealousy--that is the real jealousy.
"“But do you know what I have been thinking out during this last week,
Parfen?"
I’ll tell you.
What if she loves you now better than anyone?
"And
what if she torments you _because_ she loves you, and in proportion to her
love for you, so she torments you the more?"
"She won’t tell you this, of
course; you must have eyes to see."
"Why do you suppose she consents to
marry you?"
"She must have a reason, and that reason she will tell you
some day."
"Some women desire the kind of love you give her, and she is
probably one of these."
Your love and your wild nature impress her.
"Do
you know that a woman is capable of driving a man crazy almost, with
her cruelties and mockeries, and feels not one single pang of regret,
because she looks at him and says to herself, ‘There!"
"I’ll torment this
man nearly into his grave, and then, oh!"
"how I’ll compensate him for it
all with my love!’”

Rogojin listened to the end, and then burst out laughing:

“Why, prince, I declare you must have had a taste of this sort of thing
yourself--haven’t you?"
"I have heard tell of something of the kind, you
know; is it true?”

“What?"
"What can you have heard?” said the prince, stammering."
Rogojin continued to laugh loudly.
"He had listened to the prince’s
speech with curiosity and some satisfaction."
"The speaker’s impulsive
warmth had surprised and even comforted him."
"“Why, I’ve not only heard of it; I see it for myself,” he said."
"“When
have you ever spoken like that before?"
"It wasn’t like yourself, prince."
"Why, if I hadn’t heard this report about you, I should never have come
all this way into the park--at midnight, too!”

“I don’t understand you in the least, Parfen.”

“Oh, _she_ told me all about it long ago, and tonight I saw for myself."
"I saw you at the music, you know, and whom you were sitting with."
"She
swore to me yesterday, and again today, that you are madly in love with
Aglaya Ivanovna."
"But that’s all the same to me, prince, and it’s not my
affair at all; for if you have ceased to love _her_, _she_ has not ceased
to love _you_."
"You know, of course, that she wants to marry you to that
girl?"
She’s sworn to it!
"Ha, ha!"
"She says to me, ‘Until then I won’t marry
you."
"When they go to church, we’ll go too--and not before.’ What on earth
does she mean by it?"
"I don’t know, and I never did."
"Either she loves you
without limits or--yet, if she loves you, why does she wish to marry
you to another girl?"
"She says, ‘I want to see him happy,’ which is to
say--she loves you.”

“I wrote, and I say to you once more, that she is not in her right
mind,” said the prince, who had listened with anguish to what Rogojin
said."
“Goodness knows--you may be wrong there!
"At all events, she named the
day this evening, as we left the gardens."
"‘In three weeks,’ says she,
‘and perhaps sooner, we shall be married.’ She swore to it, took off her
cross and kissed it."
"So it all depends upon you now, prince, You see!"
"Ha, ha!”

“That’s all madness."
"What you say about me, Parfen, never can and never
will be."
"Tomorrow, I shall come and see you--”

“How can she be mad,” Rogojin interrupted, “when she is sane enough for
other people and only mad for you?"
"How can she write letters to _her_, if
she’s mad?"
"If she were insane they would observe it in her letters.”

“What letters?” said the prince, alarmed."
“She writes to _her_--and the girl reads the letters.
"Haven’t you
heard?--You are sure to hear; she’s sure to show you the letters
herself.”

“I won’t believe this!” cried the prince."
"“Why, prince, you’ve only gone a few steps along this road, I perceive."
You are evidently a mere beginner.
Wait a bit!
"Before long, you’ll have
your own detectives, you’ll watch day and night, and you’ll know every
little thing that goes on there--that is, if--”

“Drop that subject, Rogojin, and never mention it again."
"And listen:
as I have sat here, and talked, and listened, it has suddenly struck me
that tomorrow is my birthday."
"It must be about twelve o’clock, now; come
home with me--do, and we’ll see the day in!"
"We’ll have some wine, and
you shall wish me--I don’t know what--but you, especially you, must
wish me a good wish, and I shall wish you full happiness in return."
"Otherwise, hand me my cross back again."
"You didn’t return it to me next
day."
"Haven’t you got it on now?”

“Yes, I have,” said Rogojin."
"“Come along, then."
"I don’t wish to meet my new year without you--my new
life, I should say, for a new life is beginning for me."
"Did you know,
Parfen, that a new life had begun for me?”

“I see for myself that it is so--and I shall tell _her_."
"But you are not
quite yourself, Lef Nicolaievitch.”

IV."
"The prince observed with great surprise, as he approached his villa,
accompanied by Rogojin, that a large number of people were assembled on
his verandah, which was brilliantly lighted up."
"The company seemed merry
and were noisily laughing and talking--even quarrelling, to judge from
the sounds."
"At all events they were clearly enjoying themselves, and
the prince observed further on closer investigation--that all had been
drinking champagne."
"To judge from the lively condition of some of the
party, it was to be supposed that a considerable quantity of champagne
had been consumed already."
"All the guests were known to the prince; but the curious part of the
matter was that they had all arrived on the same evening, as though with
one accord, although he had only himself recollected the fact that it
was his birthday a few moments since."
"“You must have told somebody you were going to trot out the champagne,
and that’s why they are all come!” muttered Rogojin, as the two entered
the verandah."
“We know all about that!
"You’ve only to whistle and they
come up in shoals!” he continued, almost angrily."
"He was doubtless
thinking of his own late experiences with his boon companions."
"All surrounded the prince with exclamations of welcome, and, on hearing
that it was his birthday, with cries of congratulation and delight; many
of them were very noisy."
"The presence of certain of those in the room surprised the prince
vastly, but the guest whose advent filled him with the greatest
wonder--almost amounting to alarm--was Evgenie Pavlovitch."
"The prince
could not believe his eyes when he beheld the latter, and could not help
thinking that something was wrong."
Lebedeff ran up promptly to explain the arrival of all these gentlemen.
"He was himself somewhat intoxicated, but the prince gathered from his
long-winded periods that the party had assembled quite naturally, and
accidentally."
"First of all Hippolyte had arrived, early in the evening, and feeling
decidedly better, had determined to await the prince on the verandah."
"There Lebedeff had joined him, and his household had followed--that is,
his daughters and General Ivolgin."
"Burdovsky had brought Hippolyte, and
stayed on with him."
"Gania and Ptitsin had dropped in accidentally later
on; then came Keller, and he and Colia insisted on having champagne."
Evgenie Pavlovitch had only dropped in half an hour or so ago.
"Lebedeff
had served the champagne readily."
"“My own though, prince, my own, mind,” he said, “and there’ll be some
supper later on; my daughter is getting it ready now."
"Come and sit down,
prince, we are all waiting for you, we want you with us."
"Fancy what we
have been discussing!"
"You know the question, ‘to be or not to be,’--out
of Hamlet!"
A contemporary theme!
Quite up-to-date!
"Mr. Hippolyte has
been eloquent to a degree."
"He won’t go to bed, but he has only drunk a
little champagne, and that can’t do him any harm."
"Come along, prince,
and settle the question."
"Everyone is waiting for you, sighing for the
light of your luminous intelligence...”

The prince noticed the sweet, welcoming look on Vera Lebedeff’s face, as
she made her way towards him through the crowd."
"He held out his hand to
her."
"She took it, blushing with delight, and wished him “a happy life
from that day forward.” Then she ran off to the kitchen, where her
presence was necessary to help in the preparations for supper."
"Before
the prince’s arrival she had spent some time on the terrace, listening
eagerly to the conversation, though the visitors, mostly under the
influence of wine, were discussing abstract subjects far beyond her
comprehension."
"In the next room her younger sister lay on a wooden
chest, sound asleep, with her mouth wide open; but the boy, Lebedeff’s
son, had taken up his position close beside Colia and Hippolyte, his
face lit up with interest in the conversation of his father and the
rest, to which he would willingly have listened for ten hours at a
stretch."
"“I have waited for you on purpose, and am very glad to see you arrive so
happy,” said Hippolyte, when the prince came forward to press his hand,
immediately after greeting Vera."
"“And how do you know that I am ‘so happy’?”

“I can see it by your face!"
"Say ‘how do you do’ to the others, and
come and sit down here, quick--I’ve been waiting for you!” he added,
accentuating the fact that he had waited."
"On the prince’s asking, “Will
it not be injurious to you to sit out so late?” he replied that he could
not believe that he had thought himself dying three days or so ago, for
he never had felt better than this evening."
"Burdovsky next jumped up and explained that he had come in by accident,
having escorted Hippolyte from town."
"He murmured that he was glad he
had “written nonsense” in his letter, and then pressed the prince’s hand
warmly and sat down again."
The prince approached Evgenie Pavlovitch last of all.
"The latter
immediately took his arm."
"“I have a couple of words to say to you,” he began, “and those on a very
important matter; let’s go aside for a minute or two.”

“Just a couple of words!” whispered another voice in the prince’s other
ear, and another hand took his other arm."
"Muishkin turned, and to his
great surprise observed a red, flushed face and a droll-looking figure
which he recognized at once as that of Ferdishenko."
"Goodness knows where
he had turned up from!"
“Do you remember Ferdishenko?” he asked.
“Where have you dropped from?” cried the prince.
"“He is sorry for his sins now, prince,” cried Keller."
"“He did not
want to let you know he was here; he was hidden over there in the
corner,--but he repents now, he feels his guilt.”

“Why, what has he done?”

“I met him outside and brought him in--he’s a gentleman who doesn’t
often allow his friends to see him, of late--but he’s sorry now.”

“Delighted, I’m sure!--I’ll come back directly, gentlemen,--sit down
there with the others, please,--excuse me one moment,” said the host,
getting away with difficulty in order to follow Evgenie."
"“You are very gay here,” began the latter, “and I have had quite
a pleasant half-hour while I waited for you."
"Now then, my dear Lef
Nicolaievitch, this is what’s the matter."
"I’ve arranged it all with
Moloftsoff, and have just come in to relieve your mind on that score."
You need be under no apprehensions.
"He was very sensible, as he should
be, of course, for I think he was entirely to blame himself.”

“What Moloftsoff?”

“The young fellow whose arms you held, don’t you know?"
"He was so wild
with you that he was going to send a friend to you tomorrow morning.”

“What nonsense!”

“Of course it is nonsense, and in nonsense it would have ended,
doubtless; but you know these fellows, they--”

“Excuse me, but I think you must have something else that you wished to
speak about, Evgenie Pavlovitch?”

“Of course, I have!” said the other, laughing."
"“You see, my dear fellow,
tomorrow, very early in the morning, I must be off to town about this
unfortunate business (my uncle, you know!)."
"Just imagine, my dear sir, it
is all true--word for word--and, of course, everybody knew it excepting
myself."
"All this has been such a blow to me that I have not managed to
call in at the Epanchins’."
"Tomorrow I shall not see them either, because
I shall be in town."
"I may not be here for three days or more; in a word,
my affairs are a little out of gear."
"But though my town business is,
of course, most pressing, still I determined not to go away until I had
seen you, and had a clear understanding with you upon certain points;
and that without loss of time."
"I will wait now, if you will allow me,
until the company departs; I may just as well, for I have nowhere else
to go to, and I shall certainly not do any sleeping tonight; I’m far too
excited."
"And finally, I must confess that, though I know it is bad form
to pursue a man in this way, I have come to beg your friendship, my
dear prince."
"You are an unusual sort of a person; you don’t lie at every
step, as some men do; in fact, you don’t lie at all, and there is a
matter in which I need a true and sincere friend, for I really may claim
to be among the number of bona fide unfortunates just now.”

He laughed again."
"“But the trouble is,” said the prince, after a slight pause for
reflection, “that goodness only knows when this party will break up."
Hadn’t we better stroll into the park?
"I’ll excuse myself, there’s no
danger of their going away.”

“No, no!"
"I have my reasons for wishing them not to suspect us of being
engaged in any specially important conversation."
"There are gentry
present who are a little too much interested in us."
"You are not aware of
that perhaps, prince?"
"It will be a great deal better if they see that
we are friendly just in an ordinary way."
"They’ll all go in a couple of
hours, and then I’ll ask you to give me twenty minutes--half an hour at
most.”

“By all means!"
"I assure you I am delighted--you need not have entered
into all these explanations."
"As for your remarks about friendship with
me--thanks, very much indeed."
"You must excuse my being a little absent
this evening."
"Do you know, I cannot somehow be attentive to anything
just now?”

“I see, I see,” said Evgenie, smiling gently."
"His mirth seemed very near
the surface this evening."
"“What do you see?” said the prince, startled."
"“I don’t want you to suspect that I have simply come here to deceive
you and pump information out of you!” said Evgenie, still smiling, and
without making any direct reply to the question."
"“Oh, but I haven’t the slightest doubt that you did come to pump me,”
 said the prince, laughing himself, at last; “and I dare say you are
quite prepared to deceive me too, so far as that goes."
But what of that?
"I’m not afraid of you; besides, you’ll hardly believe it, I feel
as though I really didn’t care a scrap one way or the other, just
now!--And--and--and as you are a capital fellow, I am convinced of that, I
dare say we really shall end by being good friends."
"I like you very much
Evgenie Pavlovitch; I consider you a very good fellow indeed.”

“Well, in any case, you are a most delightful man to have to deal with,
be the business what it may,” concluded Evgenie."
"“Come along now, I’ll
drink a glass to your health."
"I’m charmed to have entered into alliance
with you."
"By-the-by,” he added suddenly, “has this young Hippolyte come
down to stay with you?”

“Yes.”

“He’s not going to die at once, I should think, is he?”

“Why?”

“Oh, I don’t know."
"I’ve been half an hour here with him, and he--”

Hippolyte had been waiting for the prince all this time, and had never
ceased looking at him and Evgenie Pavlovitch as they conversed in the
corner."
He became much excited when they approached the table once more.
"He was disturbed in his mind, it seemed; perspiration stood in large
drops on his forehead; in his gleaming eyes it was easy to read
impatience and agitation; his gaze wandered from face to face of those
present, and from object to object in the room, apparently without aim."
"He had taken a part, and an animated one, in the noisy conversation of
the company; but his animation was clearly the outcome of fever."
"His
talk was almost incoherent; he would break off in the middle of a
sentence which he had begun with great interest, and forget what he had
been saying."
"The prince discovered to his dismay that Hippolyte had been
allowed to drink two large glasses of champagne; the one now standing by
him being the third."
"All this he found out afterwards; at the moment he
did not notice anything, very particularly."
"“Do you know I am specially glad that today is your birthday!” cried
Hippolyte."
"“Why?”

“You’ll soon see."
"D’you know I had a feeling that there would be a lot
of people here tonight?"
"It’s not the first time that my presentiments
have been fulfilled."
"I wish I had known it was your birthday, I’d have
brought you a present--perhaps I have got a present for you!"
Who knows?
"Ha, ha!"
"How long is it now before daylight?”

“Not a couple of hours,” said Ptitsin, looking at his watch."
"“What’s the
good of daylight now?"
"One can read all night in the open air without
it,” said someone."
“The good of it!
"Well, I want just to see a ray of the sun,” said
Hippolyte."
"“Can one drink to the sun’s health, do you think, prince?”

“Oh, I dare say one can; but you had better be calm and lie down,
Hippolyte--that’s much more important.”

“You are always preaching about resting; you are a regular nurse to me,
prince."
"As soon as the sun begins to ‘resound’ in the sky--what poet
said that?"
"‘The sun resounded in the sky.’ It is beautiful, though
there’s no sense in it!--then we will go to bed."
"Lebedeff, tell me, is
the sun the source of life?"
"What does the source, or ‘spring,’ of life
really mean in the Apocalypse?"
"You have heard of the ‘Star that is
called Wormwood,’ prince?”

“I have heard that Lebedeff explains it as the railroads that cover
Europe like a net.”

Everybody laughed, and Lebedeff got up abruptly."
“No!
"Allow me, that is not what we are discussing!” he cried, waving
his hand to impose silence."
“Allow me!
"With these gentlemen... all
these gentlemen,” he added, suddenly addressing the prince, “on certain
points... that is...” He thumped the table repeatedly, and the laughter
increased."
"Lebedeff was in his usual evening condition, and had just
ended a long and scientific argument, which had left him excited and
irritable."
"On such occasions he was apt to evince a supreme contempt for
his opponents."
“It is not right!
"Half an hour ago, prince, it was agreed among us that
no one should interrupt, no one should laugh, that each person was to
express his thoughts freely; and then at the end, when everyone had
spoken, objections might be made, even by the atheists."
"We chose the
general as president."
"Now without some such rule and order, anyone might
be shouted down, even in the loftiest and most profound thought....”

“Go on!"
Go on!
Nobody is going to interrupt you!” cried several voices.
"“Speak, but keep to the point!”

“What is this ‘star’?” asked another."
"“I have no idea,” replied General Ivolgin, who presided with much
gravity."
"“I love these arguments, prince,” said Keller, also more than half
intoxicated, moving restlessly in his chair."
"“Scientific and political.”
 Then, turning suddenly towards Evgenie Pavlovitch, who was seated near
him: “Do you know, I simply adore reading the accounts of the debates in
the English parliament."
"Not that the discussions themselves interest
me; I am not a politician, you know; but it delights me to see how they
address each other ‘the noble lord who agrees with me,’ ‘my honourable
opponent who astonished Europe with his proposal,’ ‘the noble viscount
sitting opposite’--all these expressions, all this parliamentarism of
a free people, has an enormous attraction for me."
"It fascinates me,
prince."
"I have always been an artist in the depths of my soul, I assure
you, Evgenie Pavlovitch.”

“Do you mean to say,” cried Gania, from the other corner, “do you mean
to say that railways are accursed inventions, that they are a source of
ruin to humanity, a poison poured upon the earth to corrupt the springs
of life?”

Gavrila Ardalionovitch was in high spirits that evening, and it seemed
to the prince that his gaiety was mingled with triumph."
"Of course he was
only joking with Lebedeff, meaning to egg him on, but he grew excited
himself at the same time."
"“Not the railways, oh dear, no!” replied Lebedeff, with a mixture of
violent anger and extreme enjoyment."
"“Considered alone, the railways
will not pollute the springs of life, but as a whole they are accursed."
"The whole tendency of our latest centuries, in its scientific and
materialistic aspect, is most probably accursed.”

“Is it certainly accursed?..."
or do you only mean it might be?
"That is
an important point,” said Evgenie Pavlovitch."
"“It is accursed, certainly accursed!” replied the clerk, vehemently."
"“Don’t go so fast, Lebedeff; you are much milder in the morning,” said
Ptitsin, smiling."
"“But, on the other hand, more frank in the evening!"
"In the evening
sincere and frank,” repeated Lebedeff, earnestly."
"“More candid, more
exact, more honest, more honourable, and... although I may show you my
weak side, I challenge you all; you atheists, for instance!"
"How are you
going to save the world?"
"How find a straight road of progress, you men
of science, of industry, of cooperation, of trades unions, and all the
rest?"
"How are you going to save it, I say?"
By what?
By credit?
"What is
credit?"
"To what will credit lead you?”

“You are too inquisitive,” remarked Evgenie Pavlovitch."
"“Well, anyone who does not interest himself in questions such as this
is, in my opinion, a mere fashionable dummy.”

“But it will lead at least to solidarity, and balance of interests,”
 said Ptitsin."
“You will reach that with nothing to help you but credit?
"Without
recourse to any moral principle, having for your foundation only
individual selfishness, and the satisfaction of material desires?"
"Universal peace, and the happiness of mankind as a whole, being the
result!"
"Is it really so that I may understand you, sir?”

“But the universal necessity of living, of drinking, of eating--in
short, the whole scientific conviction that this necessity can only be
satisfied by universal co-operation and the solidarity of interests--is,
it seems to me, a strong enough idea to serve as a basis, so to speak,
and a ‘spring of life,’ for humanity in future centuries,” said Gavrila
Ardalionovitch, now thoroughly roused."
"“The necessity of eating and drinking, that is to say, solely the
instinct of self-preservation...”

“Is not that enough?"
"The instinct of self-preservation is the normal law
of humanity...”

“Who told you that?” broke in Evgenie Pavlovitch."
"“It is a law, doubtless, but a law neither more nor less normal than
that of destruction, even self-destruction."
"Is it possible that
the whole normal law of humanity is contained in this sentiment of
self-preservation?”

“Ah!” cried Hippolyte, turning towards Evgenie Pavlovitch, and looking
at him with a queer sort of curiosity."
"Then seeing that Radomski was laughing, he began to laugh himself,
nudged Colia, who was sitting beside him, with his elbow, and again
asked what time it was."
"He even pulled Colia’s silver watch out of his
hand, and looked at it eagerly."
"Then, as if he had forgotten everything,
he stretched himself out on the sofa, put his hands behind his head, and
looked up at the sky."
"After a minute or two he got up and came back
to the table to listen to Lebedeff’s outpourings, as the latter
passionately commentated on Evgenie Pavlovitch’s paradox."
“That is an artful and traitorous idea.
"A smart notion,” vociferated
the clerk, “thrown out as an apple of discord."
But it is just.
"You are a
scoffer, a man of the world, a cavalry officer, and, though not without
brains, you do not realize how profound is your thought, nor how true."
"Yes, the laws of self-preservation and of self-destruction are equally
powerful in this world."
"The devil will hold his empire over humanity
until a limit of time which is still unknown."
You laugh?
"You do not
believe in the devil?"
"Scepticism as to the devil is a French idea, and
it is also a frivolous idea."
Do you know who the devil is?
"Do you know
his name?"
"Although you don’t know his name you make a mockery of his
form, following the example of Voltaire."
"You sneer at his hoofs, at
his tail, at his horns--all of them the produce of your imagination!"
"In
reality the devil is a great and terrible spirit, with neither
hoofs, nor tail, nor horns; it is you who have endowed him with these
attributes!"
"But... he is not the question just now!”

“How do you know he is not the question now?” cried Hippolyte, laughing
hysterically."
"“Another excellent idea, and worth considering!” replied Lebedeff."
"“But,
again, that is not the question."
"The question at this moment is whether
we have not weakened ‘the springs of life’ by the extension...”

“Of railways?” put in Colia eagerly."
"“Not railways, properly speaking, presumptuous youth, but the general
tendency of which railways may be considered as the outward expression
and symbol."
"We hurry and push and hustle, for the good of humanity!"
"‘The world is becoming too noisy, too commercial!’ groans some solitary
thinker."
"‘Undoubtedly it is, but the noise of waggons bearing bread to
starving humanity is of more value than tranquillity of soul,’ replies
another triumphantly, and passes on with an air of pride."
"As for me, I
don’t believe in these waggons bringing bread to humanity."
"For, founded
on no moral principle, these may well, even in the act of carrying bread
to humanity, coldly exclude a considerable portion of humanity from
enjoying it; that has been seen more than once.”

“What, these waggons may coldly exclude?” repeated someone."
"“That has been seen already,” continued Lebedeff, not deigning to
notice the interruption."
"“Malthus was a friend of humanity, but, with
ill-founded moral principles, the friend of humanity is the devourer of
humanity, without mentioning his pride; for, touch the vanity of one of
these numberless philanthropists, and to avenge his self-esteem, he will
be ready at once to set fire to the whole globe; and to tell the truth,
we are all more or less like that."
"I, perhaps, might be the first to set
a light to the fuel, and then run away."
"But, again, I must repeat, that
is not the question.”

“What is it then, for goodness’ sake?”

“He is boring us!”

“The question is connected with the following anecdote of past times;
for I am obliged to relate a story."
"In our times, and in our country,
which I hope you love as much as I do, for as far as I am concerned, I
am ready to shed the last drop of my blood...

“Go on!"
"Go on!”

“In our dear country, as indeed in the whole of Europe, a famine visits
humanity about four times a century, as far as I can remember; once in
every twenty-five years."
"I won’t swear to this being the exact figure,
but anyhow they have become comparatively rare.”

“Comparatively to what?”

“To the twelfth century, and those immediately preceding and following
it."
"We are told by historians that widespread famines occurred in those
days every two or three years, and such was the condition of things that
men actually had recourse to cannibalism, in secret, of course."
"One of
these cannibals, who had reached a good age, declared of his own free
will that during the course of his long and miserable life he had
personally killed and eaten, in the most profound secrecy, sixty monks,
not to mention several children; the number of the latter he thought was
about six, an insignificant total when compared with the enormous mass
of ecclesiastics consumed by him."
"As to adults, laymen that is to say,
he had never touched them.”

The president joined in the general outcry."
“That’s impossible!” said he in an aggrieved tone.
"“I am often
discussing subjects of this nature with him, gentlemen, but for the
most part he talks nonsense enough to make one deaf: this story has no
pretence of being true.”

“General, remember the siege of Kars!"
"And you, gentlemen, I assure you
my anecdote is the naked truth."
"I may remark that reality, although it
is governed by invariable law, has at times a resemblance to falsehood."
"In fact, the truer a thing is the less true it sounds.”

“But could anyone possibly eat sixty monks?” objected the scoffing
listeners."
"“It is quite clear that he did not eat them all at once, but in a
space of fifteen or twenty years: from that point of view the thing is
comprehensible and natural...”

“Natural?”

“And natural,” repeated Lebedeff with pedantic obstinacy."
"“Besides, a
Catholic monk is by nature excessively curious; it would be quite easy
therefore to entice him into a wood, or some secret place, on false
pretences, and there to deal with him as said."
"But I do not dispute in
the least that the number of persons consumed appears to denote a spice
of greediness.”

“It is perhaps true, gentlemen,” said the prince, quietly."
"He had
been listening in silence up to that moment without taking part in the
conversation, but laughing heartily with the others from time to time."
"Evidently he was delighted to see that everybody was amused, that
everybody was talking at once, and even that everybody was drinking."
"It seemed as if he were not intending to speak at all, when suddenly
he intervened in such a serious voice that everyone looked at him with
interest."
"“It is true that there were frequent famines at that time, gentlemen."
"I have often heard of them, though I do not know much history."
"But it
seems to me that it must have been so."
"When I was in Switzerland I used
to look with astonishment at the many ruins of feudal castles perched
on the top of steep and rocky heights, half a mile at least above
sea-level, so that to reach them one had to climb many miles of stony
tracks."
"A castle, as you know, is, a kind of mountain of stones--a
dreadful, almost an impossible, labour!"
"Doubtless the builders were
all poor men, vassals, and had to pay heavy taxes, and to keep up the
priesthood."
"How, then, could they provide for themselves, and when
had they time to plough and sow their fields?"
"The greater number must,
literally, have died of starvation."
"I have sometimes asked myself how
it was that these communities were not utterly swept off the face of the
earth, and how they could possibly survive."
"Lebedeff is not mistaken,
in my opinion, when he says that there were cannibals in those days,
perhaps in considerable numbers; but I do not understand why he should
have dragged in the monks, nor what he means by that.”

“It is undoubtedly because, in the twelfth century, monks were the only
people one could eat; they were the fat, among many lean,” said Gavrila
Ardalionovitch."
"“A brilliant idea, and most true!” cried Lebedeff, “for he never
even touched the laity."
"Sixty monks, and not a single layman!"
"It is a
terrible idea, but it is historic, it is statistic; it is indeed one of
those facts which enables an intelligent historian to reconstruct the
physiognomy of a special epoch, for it brings out this further point
with mathematical accuracy, that the clergy were in those days sixty
times richer and more flourishing than the rest of humanity and perhaps
sixty times fatter also...”

“You are exaggerating, you are exaggerating, Lebedeff!” cried his
hearers, amid laughter."
"“I admit that it is an historic thought, but what is your conclusion?”
 asked the prince."
"He spoke so seriously in addressing Lebedeff, that his tone contrasted
quite comically with that of the others."
"They were very nearly laughing
at him, too, but he did not notice it."
"“Don’t you see he is a lunatic, prince?” whispered Evgenie Pavlovitch
in his ear."
"“Someone told me just now that he is a bit touched on the
subject of lawyers, that he has a mania for making speeches and intends
to pass the examinations."
"I am expecting a splendid burlesque now.”

“My conclusion is vast,” replied Lebedeff, in a voice like thunder."
"“Let
us examine first the psychological and legal position of the criminal."
"We see that in spite of the difficulty of finding other food, the
accused, or, as we may say, my client, has often during his peculiar
life exhibited signs of repentance, and of wishing to give up this
clerical diet."
Incontrovertible facts prove this assertion.
"He has eaten
five or six children, a relatively insignificant number, no doubt,
but remarkable enough from another point of view."
"It is manifest that,
pricked by remorse--for my client is religious, in his way, and has a
conscience, as I shall prove later--and desiring to extenuate his sin
as far as possible, he has tried six times at least to substitute lay
nourishment for clerical."
"That this was merely an experiment we can
hardly doubt: for if it had been only a question of gastronomic variety,
six would have been too few; why only six?"
Why not thirty?
"But if we
regard it as an experiment, inspired by the fear of committing new
sacrilege, then this number six becomes intelligible."
"Six attempts
to calm his remorse, and the pricking of his conscience, would amply
suffice, for these attempts could scarcely have been happy ones."
"In
my humble opinion, a child is too small; I should say, not sufficient;
which would result in four or five times more lay children than monks
being required in a given time."
"The sin, lessened on the one hand, would
therefore be increased on the other, in quantity, not in quality."
"Please
understand, gentlemen, that in reasoning thus, I am taking the point of
view which might have been taken by a criminal of the middle ages."
"As
for myself, a man of the late nineteenth century, I, of course, should
reason differently; I say so plainly, and therefore you need not jeer
at me nor mock me, gentlemen."
"As for you, general, it is still more
unbecoming on your part."
"In the second place, and giving my own personal
opinion, a child’s flesh is not a satisfying diet; it is too insipid,
too sweet; and the criminal, in making these experiments, could have
satisfied neither his conscience nor his appetite."
"I am about to
conclude, gentlemen; and my conclusion contains a reply to one of the
most important questions of that day and of our own!"
"This criminal ended
at last by denouncing himself to the clergy, and giving himself up to
justice."
"We cannot but ask, remembering the penal system of that day,
and the tortures that awaited him--the wheel, the stake, the fire!--we
cannot but ask, I repeat, what induced him to accuse himself of this
crime?"
"Why did he not simply stop short at the number sixty, and keep
his secret until his last breath?"
"Why could he not simply leave the
monks alone, and go into the desert to repent?"
"Or why not become a
monk himself?"
That is where the puzzle comes in!
"There must have been
something stronger than the stake or the fire, or even than the habits
of twenty years!"
"There must have been an idea more powerful than all
the calamities and sorrows of this world, famine or torture, leprosy or
plague--an idea which entered into the heart, directed and enlarged the
springs of life, and made even that hell supportable to humanity!"
"Show me a force, a power like that, in this our century of vices
and railways!"
"I might say, perhaps, in our century of steamboats and
railways, but I repeat in our century of vices and railways, because I
am drunk but truthful!"
"Show me a single idea which unites men nowadays
with half the strength that it had in those centuries, and dare to
maintain that the ‘springs of life’ have not been polluted and weakened
beneath this ‘star,’ beneath this network in which men are entangled!"
"Don’t talk to me about your prosperity, your riches, the rarity of
famine, the rapidity of the means of transport!"
"There is more of riches,
but less of force."
"The idea uniting heart and soul to heart and soul
exists no more."
"All is loose, soft, limp--we are all of us limp...."
"Enough, gentlemen!"
I have done.
That is not the question.
"No, the
question is now, excellency, I believe, to sit down to the banquet you
are about to provide for us!”

Lebedeff had roused great indignation in some of his auditors (it
should be remarked that the bottles were constantly uncorked during his
speech); but this unexpected conclusion calmed even the most turbulent
spirits."
"“That’s how a clever barrister makes a good point!” said he,
when speaking of his peroration later on."
"The visitors began to laugh
and chatter once again; the committee left their seats, and stretched
their legs on the terrace."
"Keller alone was still disgusted with
Lebedeff and his speech; he turned from one to another, saying in a loud
voice:

“He attacks education, he boasts of the fanaticism of the twelfth
century, he makes absurd grimaces, and added to that he is by no means
the innocent he makes himself out to be."
"How did he get the money to buy
this house, allow me to ask?”

In another corner was the general, holding forth to a group of hearers,
among them Ptitsin, whom he had buttonholed."
"“I have known,” said he,
“a real interpreter of the Apocalypse, the late Gregory Semeonovitch
Burmistroff, and he--he pierced the heart like a fiery flash!"
"He began
by putting on his spectacles, then he opened a large black book;
his white beard, and his two medals on his breast, recalling acts of
charity, all added to his impressiveness."
"He began in a stern voice, and
before him generals, hard men of the world, bowed down, and ladies
fell to the ground fainting."
"But this one here--he ends by announcing a
banquet!"
"That is not the real thing!”

Ptitsin listened and smiled, then turned as if to get his hat; but if he
had intended to leave, he changed his mind."
"Before the others had risen
from the table, Gania had suddenly left off drinking, and pushed away
his glass, a dark shadow seemed to come over his face."
"When they all
rose, he went and sat down by Rogojin."
"It might have been believed that
quite friendly relations existed between them."
"Rogojin, who had also
seemed on the point of going away now sat motionless, his head bent,
seeming to have forgotten his intention."
"He had drunk no wine, and
appeared absorbed in reflection."
"From time to time he raised his eyes,
and examined everyone present; one might have imagined that he was
expecting something very important to himself, and that he had decided
to wait for it."
"The prince had taken two or three glasses of champagne,
and seemed cheerful."
"As he rose he noticed Evgenie Pavlovitch, and,
remembering the appointment he had made with him, smiled pleasantly."
"Evgenie Pavlovitch made a sign with his head towards Hippolyte, whom he
was attentively watching."
"The invalid was fast asleep, stretched out on
the sofa."
"“Tell me, prince, why on earth did this boy intrude himself upon you?”
 he asked, with such annoyance and irritation in his voice that the
prince was quite surprised."
"“I wouldn’t mind laying odds that he is up
to some mischief.”

“I have observed,” said the prince, “that he seems to be an object of
very singular interest to you, Evgenie Pavlovitch."
"Why is it?”

“You may add that I have surely enough to think of, on my own account,
without him; and therefore it is all the more surprising that I cannot
tear my eyes and thoughts away from his detestable physiognomy.”

“Oh, come!"
"He has a handsome face.”

“Why, look at him--look at him now!”

The prince glanced again at Evgenie Pavlovitch with considerable
surprise."
"V.

Hippolyte, who had fallen asleep during Lebedeff’s discourse, now
suddenly woke up, just as though someone had jogged him in the side."
"He
shuddered, raised himself on his arm, gazed around, and grew very pale."
A look almost of terror crossed his face as he recollected.
“What!
are they all off?
Is it all over?
"Is the sun up?” He trembled,
and caught at the prince’s hand."
“What time is it?
"Tell me, quick, for
goodness’ sake!"
"How long have I slept?” he added, almost in despair,
just as though he had overslept something upon which his whole fate
depended."
"“You have slept seven or perhaps eight minutes,” said Evgenie
Pavlovitch."
"Hippolyte gazed eagerly at the latter, and mused for a few moments."
"“Oh, is that all?” he said at last."
"“Then I--”

He drew a long, deep breath of relief, as it seemed."
"He realized that
all was not over as yet, that the sun had not risen, and that the guests
had merely gone to supper."
"He smiled, and two hectic spots appeared on
his cheeks."
"“So you counted the minutes while I slept, did you, Evgenie Pavlovitch?”
 he said, ironically."
"“You have not taken your eyes off me all the
evening--I have noticed that much, you see!"
"Ah, Rogojin!"
"I’ve just
been dreaming about him, prince,” he added, frowning."
"“Yes, by the by,”
 starting up, “where’s the orator?"
Where’s Lebedeff?
Has he finished?
What did he talk about?
"Is it true, prince, that you once declared that
‘beauty would save the world’?"
Great Heaven!
"The prince says that beauty
saves the world!"
"And I declare that he only has such playful ideas
because he’s in love!"
"Gentlemen, the prince is in love."
"I guessed it the
moment he came in."
"Don’t blush, prince; you make me sorry for you."
"What
beauty saves the world?"
"Colia told me that you are a zealous Christian;
is it so?"
"Colia says you call yourself a Christian.”

The prince regarded him attentively, but said nothing."
"“You don’t answer me; perhaps you think I am very fond of you?” added
Hippolyte, as though the words had been drawn from him."
"“No, I don’t think that."
"I know you don’t love me.”

“What, after yesterday?"
"Wasn’t I honest with you?”

“I knew yesterday that you didn’t love me.”

“Why so?"
why so?
"Because I envy you, eh?"
"You always think that, I know."
But do you know why I am saying all this?
Look here!
"I must have some
more champagne--pour me out some, Keller, will you?”

“No, you’re not to drink any more, Hippolyte."
"I won’t let you.” The
prince moved the glass away."
"“Well perhaps you’re right,” said Hippolyte, musing."
"“They might
say--yet, devil take them!"
"what does it matter?--prince, what can it
matter what people will say of us _then_, eh?"
I believe I’m half asleep.
I’ve had such a dreadful dream--I’ve only just remembered it.
"Prince, I
don’t wish you such dreams as that, though sure enough, perhaps, I _don’t_
love you."
"Why wish a man evil, though you do not love him, eh?"
"Give
me your hand--let me press it sincerely."
"There--you’ve given me your
hand--you must feel that I _do_ press it sincerely, don’t you?"
"I don’t
think I shall drink any more."
What time is it?
"Never mind, I know the
time."
"The time has come, at all events."
What!
"they are laying supper
over there, are they?"
Then this table is free?
"Capital, gentlemen!"
I--hem!
these gentlemen are not listening.
"Prince, I will just read over
an article I have here."
"Supper is more interesting, of course, but--”

Here Hippolyte suddenly, and most unexpectedly, pulled out of his
breast-pocket a large sealed paper."
"This imposing-looking document he
placed upon the table before him."
The effect of this sudden action upon the company was instantaneous.
Evgenie Pavlovitch almost bounded off his chair in excitement.
"Rogojin
drew nearer to the table with a look on his face as if he knew what was
coming."
"Gania came nearer too; so did Lebedeff and the others--the paper
seemed to be an object of great interest to the company in general."
"“What have you got there?” asked the prince, with some anxiety."
"“At the first glimpse of the rising sun, prince, I will go to bed."
"I
told you I would, word of honour!"
You shall see!” cried Hippolyte.
"“You think I’m not capable of opening this packet, do you?” He glared
defiantly round at the audience in general."
The prince observed that he was trembling all over.
“None of us ever thought such a thing!” Muishkin replied for all.
"“Why
should you suppose it of us?"
"And what are you going to read, Hippolyte?"
"What is it?”

“Yes, what is it?” asked others."
"The packet sealed with red wax seemed
to attract everyone, as though it were a magnet."
"“I wrote this yesterday, myself, just after I saw you, prince, and told
you I would come down here."
"I wrote all day and all night, and finished
it this morning early."
"Afterwards I had a dream.”

“Hadn’t we better hear it tomorrow?” asked the prince timidly."
"“Tomorrow ‘there will be no more time!’” laughed Hippolyte,
hysterically."
"“You needn’t be afraid; I shall get through the whole
thing in forty minutes, at most an hour!"
"Look how interested everybody
is!"
Everybody has drawn near.
Look!
"look at them all staring at my
sealed packet!"
"If I hadn’t sealed it up it wouldn’t have been half so
effective!"
"Ha, ha!"
"that’s mystery, that is!"
"Now then, gentlemen, shall
I break the seal or not?"
"Say the word; it’s a mystery, I tell you--a
secret!"
"Prince, you know who said there would be ‘no more time’?"
"It was
the great and powerful angel in the Apocalypse.”

“Better not read it now,” said the prince, putting his hand on the
packet."
"“No, don’t read it!” cried Evgenie suddenly."
"He appeared so strangely
disturbed that many of those present could not help wondering."
“Reading?
"None of your reading now!” said somebody; “it’s supper-time.”
 “What sort of an article is it?"
For a paper?
"Probably it’s very
dull,” said another."
"But the prince’s timid gesture had impressed even
Hippolyte."
"“Then I’m not to read it?” he whispered, nervously."
"“Am I not to read
it?” he repeated, gazing around at each face in turn."
"“What are you
afraid of, prince?” he turned and asked the latter suddenly."
"“What should I be afraid of?”

“Has anyone a coin about them?"
"Give me a twenty-copeck piece, somebody!”
 And Hippolyte leapt from his chair."
"“Here you are,” said Lebedeff, handing him one; he thought the boy had
gone mad."
"“Vera Lukianovna,” said Hippolyte, “toss it, will you?"
"Heads, I read,
tails, I don’t.”

Vera Lebedeff tossed the coin into the air and let it fall on the table."
"It was “heads.”

“Then I read it,” said Hippolyte, in the tone of one bowing to the fiat
of destiny."
"He could not have grown paler if a verdict of death had
suddenly been presented to him."
"“But after all, what is it?"
"Is it possible that I should have just
risked my fate by tossing up?” he went on, shuddering; and looked round
him again."
His eyes had a curious expression of sincerity.
"“That is
an astonishing psychological fact,” he cried, suddenly addressing
the prince, in a tone of the most intense surprise."
"“It is... it
is something quite inconceivable, prince,” he repeated with growing
animation, like a man regaining consciousness."
"“Take note of it,
prince, remember it; you collect, I am told, facts concerning capital
punishment..."
They told me so.
"Ha, ha!"
"My God, how absurd!” He sat
down on the sofa, put his elbows on the table, and laid his head on
his hands."
"“It is shameful--though what does it matter to me if it is
shameful?"
"“Gentlemen, gentlemen!"
"I am about to break the seal,” he continued, with
determination."
"“I--I--of course I don’t insist upon anyone listening if
they do not wish to.”

With trembling fingers he broke the seal and drew out several sheets of
paper, smoothed them out before him, and began sorting them."
“What on earth does all this mean?
"What’s he going to read?” muttered
several voices."
"Others said nothing; but one and all sat down and
watched with curiosity."
"They began to think something strange might
really be about to happen."
"Vera stood and trembled behind her father’s
chair, almost in tears with fright; Colia was nearly as much alarmed
as she was."
"Lebedeff jumped up and put a couple of candles nearer to
Hippolyte, so that he might see better."
"“Gentlemen, this--you’ll soon see what this is,” began Hippolyte, and
suddenly commenced his reading."
"“It’s headed, ‘A Necessary Explanation,’ with the motto, ‘_Après moi
le déluge!_’ Oh, deuce take it all!"
"Surely I can never have seriously
written such a silly motto as that?"
"Look here, gentlemen, I beg to give
notice that all this is very likely terrible nonsense."
"It is only a few
ideas of mine."
"If you think that there is anything mysterious coming--or
in a word--”

“Better read on without any more beating about the bush,” said Gania."
“Affectation!” remarked someone else.
"“Too much talk,” said Rogojin, breaking the silence for the first time."
"Hippolyte glanced at him suddenly, and when their eyes met Rogojin
showed his teeth in a disagreeable smile, and said the following strange
words: “That’s not the way to settle this business, my friend; that’s
not the way at all.”

Of course nobody knew what Rogojin meant by this; but his words made
a deep impression upon all."
"Everyone seemed to see in a flash the same
idea."
"As for Hippolyte, their effect upon him was astounding."
"He trembled so
that the prince was obliged to support him, and would certainly have
cried out, but that his voice seemed to have entirely left him for the
moment."
"For a minute or two he could not speak at all, but panted and
stared at Rogojin."
"At last he managed to ejaculate:

“Then it was _you_ who came--_you_--_you?_”

“Came where?"
"What do you mean?” asked Rogojin, amazed."
"But Hippolyte,
panting and choking with excitement, interrupted him violently."
"“_You_ came to me last week, in the night, at two o’clock, the day I was
with you in the morning!"
"Confess it was you!”

“Last week?"
In the night?
"Have you gone cracked, my good friend?”

Hippolyte paused and considered a moment."
"Then a smile of
cunning--almost triumph--crossed his lips."
"“It was you,” he murmured, almost in a whisper, but with absolute
conviction."
"“Yes, it was you who came to my room and sat silently on a
chair at my window for a whole hour--more!"
"It was between one and two
at night; you rose and went out at about three."
"It was you, you!"
"Why you
should have frightened me so, why you should have wished to torment me
like that, I cannot tell--but you it was.”

There was absolute hatred in his eyes as he said this, but his look of
fear and his trembling had not left him."
"“You shall hear all this directly, gentlemen."
"I--I--listen!”

He seized his paper in a desperate hurry; he fidgeted with it, and tried
to sort it, but for a long while his trembling hands could not collect
the sheets together."
"“He’s either mad or delirious,” murmured Rogojin."
At last he began.
"For the first five minutes the reader’s voice continued to tremble,
and he read disconnectedly and unevenly; but gradually his voice
strengthened."
"Occasionally a violent fit of coughing stopped him, but
his animation grew with the progress of the reading--as did also the
disagreeable impression which it made upon his audience,--until it
reached the highest pitch of excitement."
Here is the article.
MY NECESSARY EXPLANATION.
"“_Après moi le déluge._

“Yesterday morning the prince came to see me."
"Among other things he
asked me to come down to his villa."
"I knew he would come and persuade
me to this step, and that he would adduce the argument that it would be
easier for me to die ‘among people and green trees,’--as he expressed
it."
"But today he did not say ‘die,’ he said ‘live.’ It is pretty much
the same to me, in my position, which he says."
"When I asked him why he
made such a point of his ‘green trees,’ he told me, to my astonishment,
that he had heard that last time I was in Pavlofsk I had said that I had
come ‘to have a last look at the trees.’

“When I observed that it was all the same whether one died among trees
or in front of a blank brick wall, as here, and that it was not worth
making any fuss over a fortnight, he agreed at once."
"But he insisted
that the good air at Pavlofsk and the greenness would certainly cause a
physical change for the better, and that my excitement, and my _dreams_,
would be perhaps relieved."
"I remarked to him, with a smile, that he
spoke like a materialist, and he answered that he had always been one."
"As he never tells a lie, there must be something in his words."
"His smile
is a pleasant one."
I have had a good look at him.
"I don’t know whether
I like him or not; and I have no time to waste over the question."
"The
hatred which I felt for him for five months has become considerably
modified, I may say, during the last month."
"Who knows, perhaps I am
going to Pavlofsk on purpose to see him!"
But why do I leave my chamber?
Those who are sentenced to death should not leave their cells.
"If I
had not formed a final resolve, but had decided to wait until the last
minute, I should not leave my room, or accept his invitation to come
and die at Pavlofsk."
"I must be quick and finish this explanation before
tomorrow."
"I shall have no time to read it over and correct it, for I
must read it tomorrow to the prince and two or three witnesses whom I
shall probably find there."
"“As it will be absolutely true, without a touch of falsehood, I am
curious to see what impression it will make upon me myself at the moment
when I read it out."
"This is my ‘last and solemn’--but why need I call
it that?"
"There is no question about the truth of it, for it is not
worthwhile lying for a fortnight; a fortnight of life is not itself
worth having, which is a proof that I write nothing here but pure truth."
"(“N.B.--Let me remember to consider; am I mad at this moment, or not?"
"or
rather at these moments?"
"I have been told that consumptives sometimes
do go out of their minds for a while in the last stages of the malady."
"I can prove this tomorrow when I read it out, by the impression it
makes upon the audience."
"I must settle this question once and for all,
otherwise I can’t go on with anything.)"
"“I believe I have just written dreadful nonsense; but there’s no time
for correcting, as I said before."
"Besides that, I have made myself a
promise not to alter a single word of what I write in this paper, even
though I find that I am contradicting myself every five lines."
"I wish to
verify the working of the natural logic of my ideas tomorrow during the
reading--whether I am capable of detecting logical errors, and whether
all that I have meditated over during the last six months be true, or
nothing but delirium."
"“If two months since I had been called upon to leave my room and the
view of Meyer’s wall opposite, I verily believe I should have been
sorry."
"But now I have no such feeling, and yet I am leaving this room
and Meyer’s brick wall _for ever_."
"So that my conclusion, that it is not
worth while indulging in grief, or any other emotion, for a fortnight,
has proved stronger than my very nature, and has taken over the
direction of my feelings."
But is it so?
"Is it the case that my nature
is conquered entirely?"
"If I were to be put on the rack now, I should
certainly cry out."
"I should not say that it is not worth while to yell
and feel pain because I have but a fortnight to live."
“But is it true that I have but a fortnight of life left to me?
"I know I
told some of my friends that Doctor B. had informed me that this was the
case; but I now confess that I lied; B. has not even seen me."
"However,
a week ago, I called in a medical student, Kislorodoff, who is a
Nationalist, an Atheist, and a Nihilist, by conviction, and that is why
I had him."
"I needed a man who would tell me the bare truth without any
humbug or ceremony--and so he did--indeed, almost with pleasure (which I
thought was going a little too far)."
"“Well, he plumped out that I had about a month left me; it might be a
little more, he said, under favourable circumstances, but it might
also be considerably less."
"According to his opinion I might die quite
suddenly--tomorrow, for instance--there had been such cases."
"Only a day
or two since a young lady at Colomna who suffered from consumption, and
was about on a par with myself in the march of the disease, was going
out to market to buy provisions, when she suddenly felt faint, lay down
on the sofa, gasped once, and died."
"“Kislorodoff told me all this with a sort of exaggerated devil-may-care
negligence, and as though he did me great honour by talking to me
so, because it showed that he considered me the same sort of exalted
Nihilistic being as himself, to whom death was a matter of no
consequence whatever, either way."
"“At all events, the fact remained--a month of life and no more!"
"That he
is right in his estimation I am absolutely persuaded."
"“It puzzles me much to think how on earth the prince guessed yesterday
that I have had bad dreams."
"He said to me, ‘Your excitement and dreams
will find relief at Pavlofsk.’ Why did he say ‘dreams’?"
"Either he is a
doctor, or else he is a man of exceptional intelligence and wonderful
powers of observation."
"(But that he is an ‘idiot,’ at bottom there can
be no doubt whatever.)"
"It so happened that just before he arrived I had
a delightful little dream; one of a kind that I have hundreds of just
now."
"I had fallen asleep about an hour before he came in, and dreamed
that I was in some room, not my own."
"It was a large room, well
furnished, with a cupboard, chest of drawers, sofa, and my bed, a fine
wide bed covered with a silken counterpane."
"But I observed in the room
a dreadful-looking creature, a sort of monster."
"It was a little like a
scorpion, but was not a scorpion, but far more horrible, and especially
so, because there are no creatures anything like it in nature, and
because it had appeared to me for a purpose, and bore some mysterious
signification."
"I looked at the beast well; it was brown in colour and
had a shell; it was a crawling kind of reptile, about eight inches long,
and narrowed down from the head, which was about a couple of fingers in
width, to the end of the tail, which came to a fine point."
"Out of its
trunk, about a couple of inches below its head, came two legs at an
angle of forty-five degrees, each about three inches long, so that the
beast looked like a trident from above."
"It had eight hard needle-like
whiskers coming out from different parts of its body; it went along like
a snake, bending its body about in spite of the shell it wore, and its
motion was very quick and very horrible to look at."
"I was dreadfully
afraid it would sting me; somebody had told me, I thought, that it
was venomous; but what tormented me most of all was the wondering and
wondering as to who had sent it into my room, and what was the mystery
which I felt it contained."
"“It hid itself under the cupboard and under the chest of drawers, and
crawled into the corners."
"I sat on a chair and kept my legs tucked
under me."
"Then the beast crawled quietly across the room and disappeared
somewhere near my chair."
"I looked about for it in terror, but I still
hoped that as my feet were safely tucked away it would not be able to
touch me."
"“Suddenly I heard behind me, and about on a level with my head, a sort
of rattling sound."
"I turned sharp round and saw that the brute had
crawled up the wall as high as the level of my face, and that its
horrible tail, which was moving incredibly fast from side to side, was
actually touching my hair!"
I jumped up--and it disappeared.
"I did not
dare lie down on my bed for fear it should creep under my pillow."
"My
mother came into the room, and some friends of hers."
"They began to hunt
for the reptile and were more composed than I was; they did not seem to
be afraid of it."
But they did not understand as I did.
"“Suddenly the monster reappeared; it crawled slowly across the room and
made for the door, as though with some fixed intention, and with a slow
movement that was more horrible than ever."
"“Then my mother opened the door and called my dog, Norma."
"Norma was a
great Newfoundland, and died five years ago."
"“She sprang forward and stood still in front of the reptile as if she
had been turned to stone."
"The beast stopped too, but its tail and
claws still moved about."
"I believe animals are incapable of feeling
supernatural fright--if I have been rightly informed,--but at this
moment there appeared to me to be something more than ordinary about
Norma’s terror, as though it must be supernatural; and as though she
felt, just as I did myself, that this reptile was connected with some
mysterious secret, some fatal omen."
"“Norma backed slowly and carefully away from the brute, which followed
her, creeping deliberately after her as though it intended to make a
sudden dart and sting her."
"“In spite of Norma’s terror she looked furious, though she trembled in
all her limbs."
"At length she slowly bared her terrible teeth, opened
her great red jaws, hesitated--took courage, and seized the beast in her
mouth."
"It seemed to try to dart out of her jaws twice, but Norma caught
at it and half swallowed it as it was escaping."
"The shell cracked in her
teeth; and the tail and legs stuck out of her mouth and shook about in
a horrible manner."
"Suddenly Norma gave a piteous whine; the reptile had
bitten her tongue."
"She opened her mouth wide with the pain, and I saw
the beast lying across her tongue, and out of its body, which was almost
bitten in two, came a hideous white-looking substance, oozing out into
Norma’s mouth; it was of the consistency of a crushed black-beetle."
"Just
then I awoke and the prince entered the room.”

“Gentlemen!” said Hippolyte, breaking off here, “I have not done yet,
but it seems to me that I have written down a great deal here that is
unnecessary,--this dream--”

“You have indeed!” said Gania."
"“There is too much about myself, I know, but--” As Hippolyte said this
his face wore a tired, pained look, and he wiped the sweat off his brow."
"“Yes,” said Lebedeff, “you certainly think a great deal too much about
yourself.”

“Well--gentlemen--I do not force anyone to listen!"
"If any of you are
unwilling to sit it out, please go away, by all means!”

“He turns people out of a house that isn’t his own,” muttered Rogojin."
“Suppose we all go away?” said Ferdishenko suddenly.
"Hippolyte clutched his manuscript, and gazing at the last speaker with
glittering eyes, said: “You don’t like me at all!” A few laughed at
this, but not all."
"“Hippolyte,” said the prince, “give me the papers, and go to bed like a
sensible fellow."
"We’ll have a good talk tomorrow, but you really mustn’t
go on with this reading; it is not good for you!”

“How can I?"
"How can I?” cried Hippolyte, looking at him in amazement."
“Gentlemen!
I was a fool!
I won’t break off again.
"Listen, everyone who
wants to!”

He gulped down some water out of a glass standing near, bent over the
table, in order to hide his face from the audience, and recommenced."
"“The idea that it is not worth while living for a few weeks took
possession of me a month ago, when I was told that I had four weeks to
live, but only partially so at that time."
"The idea quite overmastered me
three days since, that evening at Pavlofsk."
"The first time that I felt
really impressed with this thought was on the terrace at the prince’s,
at the very moment when I had taken it into my head to make a last trial
of life."
"I wanted to see people and trees (I believe I said so myself),
I got excited, I maintained Burdovsky’s rights, ‘my neighbour!’--I
dreamt that one and all would open their arms, and embrace me, that
there would be an indescribable exchange of forgiveness between us all!"
"In a word, I behaved like a fool, and then, at that very same instant, I
felt my ‘last conviction.’ I ask myself now how I could have waited six
months for that conviction!"
"I knew that I had a disease that spares
no one, and I really had no illusions; but the more I realized my
condition, the more I clung to life; I wanted to live at any price."
"I
confess I might well have resented that blind, deaf fate, which, with no
apparent reason, seemed to have decided to crush me like a fly; but why
did I not stop at resentment?"
"Why did I begin to live, knowing that it
was not worthwhile to begin?"
"Why did I attempt to do what I knew to be
an impossibility?"
"And yet I could not even read a book to the end; I
had given up reading."
"What is the good of reading, what is the good of
learning anything, for just six months?"
"That thought has made me throw
aside a book more than once."
"“Yes, that wall of Meyer’s could tell a tale if it liked."
"There was no
spot on its dirty surface that I did not know by heart."
Accursed wall!
"and yet it is dearer to me than all the Pavlofsk trees!--That is--it
_would_ be dearer if it were not all the same to me, now!"
"“I remember now with what hungry interest I began to watch the lives of
other people--interest that I had never felt before!"
"I used to wait for
Colia’s arrival impatiently, for I was so ill myself, then, that I could
not leave the house."
"I so threw myself into every little detail of news,
and took so much interest in every report and rumour, that I believe I
became a regular gossip!"
"I could not understand, among other things, how
all these people--with so much life in and before them--do not become
_rich_--and I don’t understand it now."
"I remember being told of a poor
wretch I once knew, who had died of hunger."
"I was almost beside myself
with rage!"
"I believe if I could have resuscitated him I would have done
so for the sole purpose of murdering him!"
"“Occasionally I was so much better that I could go out; but the streets
used to put me in such a rage that I would lock myself up for days
rather than go out, even if I were well enough to do so!"
"I could
not bear to see all those preoccupied, anxious-looking creatures
continuously surging along the streets past me!"
"Why are they always
anxious?"
What is the meaning of their eternal care and worry?
"It is
their wickedness, their perpetual detestable malice--that’s what it
is--they are all full of malice, malice!"
"“Whose fault is it that they are all miserable, that they don’t know how
to live, though they have fifty or sixty years of life before them?"
"Why
did that fool allow himself to die of hunger with sixty years of unlived
life before him?"
"“And everyone of them shows his rags, his toil-worn hands, and yells in
his wrath: ‘Here are we, working like cattle all our lives, and always
as hungry as dogs, and there are others who do not work, and are fat and
rich!’ The eternal refrain!"
"And side by side with them trots along some
wretched fellow who has known better days, doing light porter’s work
from morn to night for a living, always blubbering and saying that
‘his wife died because he had no money to buy medicine with,’ and his
children dying of cold and hunger, and his eldest daughter gone to the
bad, and so on."
Oh!
"I have no pity and no patience for these fools of
people."
Why can’t they be Rothschilds?
"Whose fault is it that a man has
not got millions of money like Rothschild?"
"If he has life, all this must
be in his power!"
"Whose fault is it that he does not know how to live his
life?"
“Oh!
"it’s all the same to me now--_now!_ But at that time I would soak my
pillow at night with tears of mortification, and tear at my blanket in
my rage and fury."
"Oh, how I longed at that time to be turned out--_me_,
eighteen years old, poor, half-clothed, turned out into the street,
quite alone, without lodging, without work, without a crust of bread,
without relations, without a single acquaintance, in some large
town--hungry, beaten (if you like), but in good health--and _then_ I would
show them--

“What would I show them?"
"“Oh, don’t think that I have no sense of my own humiliation!"
"I have
suffered already in reading so far."
"Which of you all does not think me a
fool at this moment--a young fool who knows nothing of life--forgetting
that to live as I have lived these last six months is to live longer
than grey-haired old men."
"Well, let them laugh, and say it is all
nonsense, if they please."
"They may say it is all fairy-tales, if they
like; and I have spent whole nights telling myself fairy-tales."
"I
remember them all."
But how can I tell fairy-tales now?
"The time for them
is over."
"They amused me when I found that there was not even time for me
to learn the Greek grammar, as I wanted to do."
"‘I shall die before I get
to the syntax,’ I thought at the first page--and threw the book under
the table."
"It is there still, for I forbade anyone to pick it up."
"“If this ‘Explanation’ gets into anybody’s hands, and they have patience
to read it through, they may consider me a madman, or a schoolboy, or,
more likely, a man condemned to die, who thought it only natural to
conclude that all men, excepting himself, esteem life far too lightly,
live it far too carelessly and lazily, and are, therefore, one and all,
unworthy of it."
"Well, I affirm that my reader is wrong again, for my
convictions have nothing to do with my sentence of death."
"Ask them, ask
any one of them, or all of them, what they mean by happiness!"
"Oh, you
may be perfectly sure that if Columbus was happy, it was not after he
had discovered America, but when he was discovering it!"
"You may be quite
sure that he reached the culminating point of his happiness three days
before he saw the New World with his actual eyes, when his mutinous
sailors wanted to tack about, and return to Europe!"
"What did the New
World matter after all?"
"Columbus had hardly seen it when he died, and
in reality he was entirely ignorant of what he had discovered."
"The
important thing is life--life and nothing else!"
"What is any ‘discovery’
whatever compared with the incessant, eternal discovery of life?"
“But what is the use of talking?
"I’m afraid all this is so commonplace
that my confession will be taken for a schoolboy exercise--the work of
some ambitious lad writing in the hope of his work ‘seeing the light’;
or perhaps my readers will say that ‘I had perhaps something to say, but
did not know how to express it.’

“Let me add to this that in every idea emanating from genius, or even in
every serious human idea--born in the human brain--there always remains
something--some sediment--which cannot be expressed to others, though
one wrote volumes and lectured upon it for five-and-thirty years."
"There
is always a something, a remnant, which will never come out from your
brain, but will remain there with you, and you alone, for ever and ever,
and you will die, perhaps, without having imparted what may be the very
essence of your idea to a single living soul."
"“So that if I cannot now impart all that has tormented me for the last
six months, at all events you will understand that, having reached my
‘last convictions,’ I must have paid a very dear price for them."
"That
is what I wished, for reasons of my own, to make a point of in this my
‘Explanation.’

“But let me resume.”

VI."
“I will not deceive you.
"‘Reality’ got me so entrapped in its meshes now
and again during the past six months, that I forgot my ‘sentence’ (or
perhaps I did not wish to think of it), and actually busied myself with
affairs."
“A word as to my circumstances.
"When, eight months since, I became
very ill, I threw up all my old connections and dropped all my old
companions."
"As I was always a gloomy, morose sort of individual, my
friends easily forgot me; of course, they would have forgotten me all
the same, without that excuse."
My position at home was solitary enough.
"Five months ago I separated myself entirely from the family, and no one
dared enter my room except at stated times, to clean and tidy it, and so
on, and to bring me my meals."
"My mother dared not disobey me; she kept
the children quiet, for my sake, and beat them if they dared to make any
noise and disturb me."
"I so often complained of them that I should think
they must be very fond, indeed, of me by this time."
"I think I must have
tormented ‘my faithful Colia’ (as I called him) a good deal too."
"He
tormented me of late; I could see that he always bore my tempers as
though he had determined to ‘spare the poor invalid.’ This annoyed
me, naturally."
"He seemed to have taken it into his head to imitate the
prince in Christian meekness!"
"Surikoff, who lived above us, annoyed me,
too."
"He was so miserably poor, and I used to prove to him that he had no
one to blame but himself for his poverty."
"I used to be so angry that I
think I frightened him eventually, for he stopped coming to see me."
"He
was a most meek and humble fellow, was Surikoff."
"(N.B.--They say that
meekness is a great power."
"I must ask the prince about this, for the
expression is his.)"
"But I remember one day in March, when I went up to
his lodgings to see whether it was true that one of his children had
been starved and frozen to death, I began to hold forth to him about
his poverty being his own fault, and, in the course of my remarks, I
accidentally smiled at the corpse of his child."
"Well, the poor wretch’s
lips began to tremble, and he caught me by the shoulder, and pushed me
to the door."
"‘Go out,’ he said, in a whisper."
"I went out, of course, and
I declare I _liked_ it."
"I liked it at the very moment when I was
turned out."
"But his words filled me with a strange sort of feeling of
disdainful pity for him whenever I thought of them--a feeling which
I did not in the least desire to entertain."
"At the very moment of the
insult (for I admit that I did insult him, though I did not mean to),
this man could not lose his temper."
"His lips had trembled, but I swear
it was not with rage."
"He had taken me by the arm, and said, ‘Go out,’
without the least anger."
"There was dignity, a great deal of dignity,
about him, and it was so inconsistent with the look of him that, I
assure you, it was quite comical."
But there was no anger.
"Perhaps he
merely began to despise me at that moment."
"“Since that time he has always taken off his hat to me on the stairs,
whenever I met him, which is a thing he never did before; but he always
gets away from me as quickly as he can, as though he felt confused."
"If
he did despise me, he despised me ‘meekly,’ after his own fashion."
"“I dare say he only took his hat off out of fear, as it were, to the son
of his creditor; for he always owed my mother money."
"I thought of having
an explanation with him, but I knew that if I did, he would begin to
apologize in a minute or two, so I decided to let him alone."
"“Just about that time, that is, the middle of March, I suddenly felt
very much better; this continued for a couple of weeks."
"I used to go
out at dusk."
"I like the dusk, especially in March, when the night frost
begins to harden the day’s puddles, and the gas is burning."
"“Well, one night in the Shestilavochnaya, a man passed me with a paper
parcel under his arm."
"I did not take stock of him very carefully, but he
seemed to be dressed in some shabby summer dust-coat, much too light for
the season."
"When he was opposite the lamp-post, some ten yards away, I
observed something fall out of his pocket."
"I hurried forward to pick it
up, just in time, for an old wretch in a long kaftan rushed up too."
"He did not dispute the matter, but glanced at what was in my hand and
disappeared."
"“It was a large old-fashioned pocket-book, stuffed full; but I guessed,
at a glance, that it had anything in the world inside it, except money."
"“The owner was now some forty yards ahead of me, and was very soon lost
in the crowd."
"I ran after him, and began calling out; but as I knew
nothing to say excepting ‘hey!’ he did not turn round."
"Suddenly he
turned into the gate of a house to the left; and when I darted in after
him, the gateway was so dark that I could see nothing whatever."
"It was
one of those large houses built in small tenements, of which there must
have been at least a hundred."
"“When I entered the yard I thought I saw a man going along on the far
side of it; but it was so dark I could not make out his figure."
“I crossed to that corner and found a dirty dark staircase.
"I heard a
man mounting up above me, some way higher than I was, and thinking I
should catch him before his door would be opened to him, I rushed after
him."
"I heard a door open and shut on the fifth storey, as I panted
along; the stairs were narrow, and the steps innumerable, but at last I
reached the door I thought the right one."
"Some moments passed before I
found the bell and got it to ring."
"“An old peasant woman opened the door; she was busy lighting the
‘samovar’ in a tiny kitchen."
"She listened silently to my questions, did
not understand a word, of course, and opened another door leading into
a little bit of a room, low and scarcely furnished at all, but with
a large, wide bed in it, hung with curtains."
"On this bed lay one
Terentich, as the woman called him, drunk, it appeared to me."
"On the
table was an end of candle in an iron candlestick, and a half-bottle of
vodka, nearly finished."
"Terentich muttered something to me, and signed
towards the next room."
"The old woman had disappeared, so there was
nothing for me to do but to open the door indicated."
"I did so, and
entered the next room."
"“This was still smaller than the other, so cramped that I could scarcely
turn round; a narrow single bed at one side took up nearly all the room."
"Besides the bed there were only three common chairs, and a wretched old
kitchen-table standing before a small sofa."
"One could hardly squeeze
through between the table and the bed."
"“On the table, as in the other room, burned a tallow candle-end in an
iron candlestick; and on the bed there whined a baby of scarcely three
weeks old."
"A pale-looking woman was dressing the child, probably the
mother; she looked as though she had not as yet got over the trouble of
childbirth, she seemed so weak and was so carelessly dressed."
"Another
child, a little girl of about three years old, lay on the sofa, covered
over with what looked like a man’s old dress-coat."
"“At the table stood a man in his shirt sleeves; he had thrown off his
coat; it lay upon the bed; and he was unfolding a blue paper parcel in
which were a couple of pounds of bread, and some little sausages."
"“On the table along with these things were a few old bits of black
bread, and some tea in a pot."
"From under the bed there protruded an
open portmanteau full of bundles of rags."
"In a word, the confusion and
untidiness of the room were indescribable."
"“It appeared to me, at the first glance, that both the man and the woman
were respectable people, but brought to that pitch of poverty where
untidiness seems to get the better of every effort to cope with it, till
at last they take a sort of bitter satisfaction in it."
"When I entered
the room, the man, who had entered but a moment before me, and was still
unpacking his parcels, was saying something to his wife in an excited
manner."
"The news was apparently bad, as usual, for the woman began
whimpering."
The man’s face seemed to me to be refined and even pleasant.
"He was dark-complexioned, and about twenty-eight years of age; he wore
black whiskers, and his lip and chin were shaved."
"He looked morose, but
with a sort of pride of expression."
A curious scene followed.
"“There are people who find satisfaction in their own touchy feelings,
especially when they have just taken the deepest offence; at such
moments they feel that they would rather be offended than not."
"These
easily-ignited natures, if they are wise, are always full of remorse
afterwards, when they reflect that they have been ten times as angry as
they need have been."
"“The gentleman before me gazed at me for some seconds in amazement,
and his wife in terror; as though there was something alarmingly
extraordinary in the fact that anyone could come to see them."
"But
suddenly he fell upon me almost with fury; I had had no time to mutter
more than a couple of words; but he had doubtless observed that I was
decently dressed and, therefore, took deep offence because I had dared
enter his den so unceremoniously, and spy out the squalor and untidiness
of it."
"“Of course he was delighted to get hold of someone upon whom to vent his
rage against things in general."
"“For a moment I thought he would assault me; he grew so pale that he
looked like a woman about to have hysterics; his wife was dreadfully
alarmed."
“‘How dare you come in so?
"Be off!’ he shouted, trembling all over with
rage and scarcely able to articulate the words."
"Suddenly, however, he
observed his pocketbook in my hand."
"“‘I think you dropped this,’ I remarked, as quietly and drily as I
could."
(I thought it best to treat him so.)
"For some while he stood
before me in downright terror, and seemed unable to understand."
"He then
suddenly grabbed at his side-pocket, opened his mouth in alarm, and beat
his forehead with his hand."
"“‘My God!’ he cried, ‘where did you find it?"
"How?’ I explained in as few
words as I could, and as drily as possible, how I had seen it and picked
it up; how I had run after him, and called out to him, and how I had
followed him upstairs and groped my way to his door."
"“‘Gracious Heaven!’ he cried, ‘all our papers are in it!"
"My dear
sir, you little know what you have done for us."
"I should have been
lost--lost!’

“I had taken hold of the door-handle meanwhile, intending to leave
the room without reply; but I was panting with my run upstairs, and my
exhaustion came to a climax in a violent fit of coughing, so bad that I
could hardly stand."
"“I saw how the man dashed about the room to find me an empty chair, how
he kicked the rags off a chair which was covered up by them, brought it
to me, and helped me to sit down; but my cough went on for another three
minutes or so."
"When I came to myself he was sitting by me on another
chair, which he had also cleared of the rubbish by throwing it all over
the floor, and was watching me intently."
"“‘I’m afraid you are ill?’ he remarked, in the tone which doctors use
when they address a patient."
"‘I am myself a medical man’ (he did not say
‘doctor’), with which words he waved his hands towards the room and
its contents as though in protest at his present condition."
"‘I see that
you--’

“‘I’m in consumption,’ I said laconically, rising from my seat."
"“He jumped up, too."
"“‘Perhaps you are exaggerating--if you were to take proper measures
perhaps--”

“He was terribly confused and did not seem able to collect his scattered
senses; the pocket-book was still in his left hand."
"“‘Oh, don’t mind me,’ I said."
‘Dr.
"B---- saw me last week’ (I lugged him
in again), ‘and my hash is quite settled; pardon me--’ I took hold of the
door-handle again."
"I was on the point of opening the door and leaving my
grateful but confused medical friend to himself and his shame, when my
damnable cough got hold of me again."
“My doctor insisted on my sitting down again to get my breath.
"He now
said something to his wife who, without leaving her place, addressed a
few words of gratitude and courtesy to me."
"She seemed very shy over it,
and her sickly face flushed up with confusion."
"I remained, but with the
air of a man who knows he is intruding and is anxious to get away."
"The
doctor’s remorse at last seemed to need a vent, I could see."
"“‘If I--’ he began, breaking off abruptly every other moment, and
starting another sentence."
"‘I--I am so very grateful to you, and I am so
much to blame in your eyes, I feel sure, I--you see--’ (he pointed to
the room again) ‘at this moment I am in such a position--’

“‘Oh!’ I said, ‘there’s nothing to see; it’s quite a clear case--you’ve
lost your post and have come up to make explanations and get another, if
you can!’

“‘How do you know that?’ he asked in amazement."
"“‘Oh, it was evident at the first glance,’ I said ironically, but
not intentionally so."
"‘There are lots of people who come up from the
provinces full of hope, and run about town, and have to live as best
they can.’

“He began to talk at once excitedly and with trembling lips; he began
complaining and telling me his story."
"He interested me, I confess; I sat
there nearly an hour."
His story was a very ordinary one.
"He had been a
provincial doctor; he had a civil appointment, and had no sooner taken
it up than intrigues began."
Even his wife was dragged into these.
"He was
proud, and flew into a passion; there was a change of local government
which acted in favour of his opponents; his position was undermined,
complaints were made against him; he lost his post and came up to
Petersburg with his last remaining money, in order to appeal to higher
authorities."
"Of course nobody would listen to him for a long time; he
would come and tell his story one day and be refused promptly; another
day he would be fed on false promises; again he would be treated
harshly; then he would be told to sign some documents; then he would
sign the paper and hand it in, and they would refuse to receive it, and
tell him to file a formal petition."
"In a word he had been driven about
from office to office for five months and had spent every farthing he
had; his wife’s last rags had just been pawned; and meanwhile a child
had been born to them and--and today I have a final refusal to my
petition, and I have hardly a crumb of bread left--I have nothing left;
my wife has had a baby lately--and I--I--’

“He sprang up from his chair and turned away."
"His wife was crying in the
corner; the child had begun to moan again."
"I pulled out my note-book and
began writing in it."
"When I had finished and rose from my chair he was
standing before me with an expression of alarmed curiosity."
"“‘I have jotted down your name,’ I told him, ‘and all the rest of
it--the place you served at, the district, the date, and all."
"I have a
friend, Bachmatoff, whose uncle is a councillor of state and has to do
with these matters, one Peter Matveyevitch Bachmatoff.’

“‘Peter Matveyevitch Bachmatoff!’ he cried, trembling all over with
excitement."
"‘Why, nearly everything depends on that very man!’

“It is very curious, this story of the medical man, and my visit, and
the happy termination to which I contributed by accident!"
"Everything
fitted in, as in a novel."
"I told the poor people not to put much hope in
me, because I was but a poor schoolboy myself--(I am not really, but
I humiliated myself as much as possible in order to make them less
hopeful)--but that I would go at once to the Vassili Ostroff and see my
friend; and that as I knew for certain that his uncle adored him, and
was absolutely devoted to him as the last hope and branch of the family,
perhaps the old man might do something to oblige his nephew."
“‘If only they would allow me to explain all to his excellency!
"If I
could but be permitted to tell my tale to him!” he cried, trembling with
feverish agitation, and his eyes flashing with excitement."
"I repeated
once more that I could not hold out much hope--that it would probably
end in smoke, and if I did not turn up next morning they must make up
their minds that there was no more to be done in the matter."
"“They showed me out with bows and every kind of respect; they seemed
quite beside themselves."
"I shall never forget the expression of their
faces!"
“I took a droshky and drove over to the Vassili Ostroff at once.
"For
some years I had been at enmity with this young Bachmatoff, at school."
We considered him an aristocrat; at all events I called him one.
"He used
to dress smartly, and always drove to school in a private trap."
"He was
a good companion, and was always merry and jolly, sometimes even witty,
though he was not very intellectual, in spite of the fact that he was
always top of the class; I myself was never top in anything!"
"All his
companions were very fond of him, excepting myself."
"He had several times
during those years come up to me and tried to make friends; but I had
always turned sulkily away and refused to have anything to do with him."
I had not seen him for a whole year now; he was at the university.
"When,
at nine o’clock, or so, this evening, I arrived and was shown up to him
with great ceremony, he first received me with astonishment, and not too
affably, but he soon cheered up, and suddenly gazed intently at me and
burst out laughing."
"“‘Why, what on earth can have possessed you to come and see _me_,
Terentieff?’ he cried, with his usual pleasant, sometimes audacious, but
never offensive familiarity, which I liked in reality, but for which I
also detested him."
‘Why what’s the matter?’ he cried in alarm.
"‘Are you
ill?’

“That confounded cough of mine had come on again; I fell into a chair,
and with difficulty recovered my breath."
"‘It’s all right, it’s only
consumption’ I said."
"‘I have come to you with a petition!’

“He sat down in amazement, and I lost no time in telling him the medical
man’s history; and explained that he, with the influence which he
possessed over his uncle, might do some good to the poor fellow."
"“‘I’ll do it--I’ll do it, of course!’ he said."
"‘I shall attack my uncle
about it tomorrow morning, and I’m very glad you told me the story."
"But
how was it that you thought of coming to me about it, Terentieff?’

“‘So much depends upon your uncle,’ I said."
"‘And besides we have always
been enemies, Bachmatoff; and as you are a generous sort of fellow, I
thought you would not refuse my request because I was your enemy!’ I
added with irony."
"“‘Like Napoleon going to England, eh?’ cried he, laughing."
"‘I’ll do it
though--of course, and at once, if I can!’ he added, seeing that I rose
seriously from my chair at this point."
“And sure enough the matter ended as satisfactorily as possible.
"A month
or so later my medical friend was appointed to another post."
"He got his
travelling expenses paid, and something to help him to start life with
once more."
"I think Bachmatoff must have persuaded the doctor to accept
a loan from himself."
"I saw Bachmatoff two or three times, about this
period, the third time being when he gave a farewell dinner to the
doctor and his wife before their departure, a champagne dinner."
"“Bachmatoff saw me home after the dinner and we crossed the Nicolai
bridge."
We were both a little drunk.
"He told me of his joy, the joyful
feeling of having done a good action; he said that it was all thanks to
myself that he could feel this satisfaction; and held forth about the
foolishness of the theory that individual charity is useless."
"“I, too, was burning to have my say!"
"“‘In Moscow,’ I said, ‘there was an old state counsellor, a civil
general, who, all his life, had been in the habit of visiting the
prisons and speaking to criminals."
"Every party of convicts on its way
to Siberia knew beforehand that on the Vorobeef Hills the “old general”
 would pay them a visit."
He did all he undertook seriously and devotedly.
"He would walk down the rows of the unfortunate prisoners, stop before
each individual and ask after his needs--he never sermonized them; he
spoke kindly to them--he gave them money; he brought them all sorts of
necessaries for the journey, and gave them devotional books, choosing
those who could read, under the firm conviction that they would read to
those who could not, as they went along."
"“‘He scarcely ever talked about the particular crimes of any of them,
but listened if any volunteered information on that point."
"All the
convicts were equal for him, and he made no distinction."
"He spoke to all
as to brothers, and every one of them looked upon him as a father."
"When
he observed among the exiles some poor woman with a child, he would
always come forward and fondle the little one, and make it laugh."
"He
continued these acts of mercy up to his very death; and by that time all
the criminals, all over Russia and Siberia, knew him!"
"“‘A man I knew who had been to Siberia and returned, told me that he
himself had been a witness of how the very most hardened criminals
remembered the old general, though, in point of fact, he could never,
of course, have distributed more than a few pence to each member of a
party."
"Their recollection of him was not sentimental or particularly
devoted."
"Some wretch, for instance, who had been a murderer--cutting the
throat of a dozen fellow-creatures, for instance; or stabbing six
little children for his own amusement (there have been such men!)"
"--would
perhaps, without rhyme or reason, suddenly give a sigh and say, “I
wonder whether that old general is alive still!” Although perhaps he had
not thought of mentioning him for a dozen years before!"
"How can one say
what seed of good may have been dropped into his soul, never to die?’

“I continued in that strain for a long while, pointing out to Bachmatoff
how impossible it is to follow up the effects of any isolated good deed
one may do, in all its influences and subtle workings upon the heart and
after-actions of others."
"“‘And to think that you are to be cut off from life!’ remarked
Bachmatoff, in a tone of reproach, as though he would like to find
someone to pitch into on my account."
"“We were leaning over the balustrade of the bridge, looking into the
Neva at this moment."
"“‘Do you know what has suddenly come into my head?’ said I,
suddenly--leaning further and further over the rail."
"“‘Surely not to throw yourself into the river?’ cried Bachmatoff in
alarm."
Perhaps he read my thought in my face.
"“‘No, not yet."
At present nothing but the following consideration.
"You
see I have some two or three months left me to live--perhaps four; well,
supposing that when I have but a month or two more, I take a fancy for
some “good deed” that needs both trouble and time, like this business of
our doctor friend, for instance: why, I shall have to give up the idea
of it and take to something else--some _little_ good deed, _more within my
means_, eh?"
"Isn’t that an amusing idea!’

“Poor Bachmatoff was much impressed--painfully so."
"He took me all the
way home; not attempting to console me, but behaving with the greatest
delicacy."
"On taking leave he pressed my hand warmly and asked permission
to come and see me."
"I replied that if he came to me as a ‘comforter,’ so
to speak (for he would be in that capacity whether he spoke to me in a
soothing manner or only kept silence, as I pointed out to him), he
would but remind me each time of my approaching death!"
"He shrugged his
shoulders, but quite agreed with me; and we parted better friends than I
had expected."
"“But that evening and that night were sown the first seeds of my ‘last
conviction.’ I seized greedily on my new idea; I thirstily drank in
all its different aspects (I did not sleep a wink that night!"
"), and the
deeper I went into it the more my being seemed to merge itself in it,
and the more alarmed I became."
"A dreadful terror came over me at last,
and did not leave me all next day."
"“Sometimes, thinking over this, I became quite numb with the terror
of it; and I might well have deduced from this fact, that my ‘last
conviction’ was eating into my being too fast and too seriously, and
would undoubtedly come to its climax before long."
"And for the climax I
needed greater determination than I yet possessed."
"“However, within three weeks my determination was taken, owing to a very
strange circumstance."
"“Here on my paper, I make a note of all the figures and dates that
come into my explanation."
"Of course, it is all the same to me, but just
now--and perhaps only at this moment--I desire that all those who are to
judge of my action should see clearly out of how logical a sequence of
deductions has at length proceeded my ‘last conviction.’

“I have said above that the determination needed by me for the
accomplishment of my final resolve, came to hand not through any
sequence of causes, but thanks to a certain strange circumstance which
had perhaps no connection whatever with the matter at issue."
"Ten days
ago Rogojin called upon me about certain business of his own with which
I have nothing to do at present."
"I had never seen Rogojin before, but
had often heard about him."
"“I gave him all the information he needed, and he very soon took his
departure; so that, since he only came for the purpose of gaining the
information, the matter might have been expected to end there."
"“But he interested me too much, and all that day I was under the
influence of strange thoughts connected with him, and I determined to
return his visit the next day."
"“Rogojin was evidently by no means pleased to see me, and hinted,
delicately, that he saw no reason why our acquaintance should continue."
"For all that, however, I spent a very interesting hour, and so, I dare
say, did he."
"There was so great a contrast between us that I am sure we
must both have felt it; anyhow, I felt it acutely."
"Here was I, with my
days numbered, and he, a man in the full vigour of life, living in
the present, without the slightest thought for ‘final convictions,’ or
numbers, or days, or, in fact, for anything but that which-which--well,
which he was mad about, if he will excuse me the expression--as a feeble
author who cannot express his ideas properly."
"“In spite of his lack of amiability, I could not help seeing, in Rogojin
a man of intellect and sense; and although, perhaps, there was little in
the outside world which was of interest to him, still he was clearly a
man with eyes to see."
"“I hinted nothing to him about my ‘final conviction,’ but it appeared
to me that he had guessed it from my words."
"He remained silent--he is
a terribly silent man."
"I remarked to him, as I rose to depart, that,
in spite of the contrast and the wide differences between us two,
les extremites se touchent [‘extremes meet,’ as I explained to him in
Russian); so that maybe he was not so far from my final conviction as
appeared."
“His only reply to this was a sour grimace.
"He rose and looked for
my cap, and placed it in my hand, and led me out of the house--that
dreadful gloomy house of his--to all appearances, of course, as though I
were leaving of my own accord, and he were simply seeing me to the
door out of politeness."
"His house impressed me much; it is like a
burial-ground, he seems to like it, which is, however, quite natural."
"Such a full life as he leads is so overflowing with absorbing interests
that he has little need of assistance from his surroundings."
“The visit to Rogojin exhausted me terribly.
"Besides, I had felt ill
since the morning; and by evening I was so weak that I took to my bed,
and was in high fever at intervals, and even delirious."
"Colia sat with
me until eleven o’clock."
"“Yet I remember all he talked about, and every word we said, though
whenever my eyes closed for a moment I could picture nothing but the
image of Surikoff just in the act of finding a million roubles."
"He could
not make up his mind what to do with the money, and tore his hair over
it."
"He trembled with fear that somebody would rob him, and at last
he decided to bury it in the ground."
"I persuaded him that, instead of
putting it all away uselessly underground, he had better melt it down
and make a golden coffin out of it for his starved child, and then dig
up the little one and put her into the golden coffin."
"Surikoff accepted
this suggestion, I thought, with tears of gratitude, and immediately
commenced to carry out my design."
“I thought I spat on the ground and left him in disgust.
"Colia told
me, when I quite recovered my senses, that I had not been asleep for a
moment, but that I had spoken to him about Surikoff the whole while."
"“At moments I was in a state of dreadful weakness and misery, so that
Colia was greatly disturbed when he left me."
"“When I arose to lock the door after him, I suddenly called to mind a
picture I had noticed at Rogojin’s in one of his gloomiest rooms, over
the door."
"He had pointed it out to me himself as we walked past it, and
I believe I must have stood a good five minutes in front of it."
"There
was nothing artistic about it, but the picture made me feel strangely
uncomfortable."
It represented Christ just taken down from the cross.
"It
seems to me that painters as a rule represent the Saviour, both on the
cross and taken down from it, with great beauty still upon His face."
"This marvellous beauty they strive to preserve even in His moments of
deepest agony and passion."
"But there was no such beauty in Rogojin’s
picture."
"This was the presentment of a poor mangled body which had
evidently suffered unbearable anguish even before its crucifixion, full
of wounds and bruises, marks of the violence of soldiers and people, and
of the bitterness of the moment when He had fallen with the cross--all
this combined with the anguish of the actual crucifixion."
"“The face was depicted as though still suffering; as though the body,
only just dead, was still almost quivering with agony."
"The picture was
one of pure nature, for the face was not beautified by the artist, but
was left as it would naturally be, whosoever the sufferer, after such
anguish."
"“I know that the earliest Christian faith taught that the Saviour
suffered actually and not figuratively, and that nature was allowed her
own way even while His body was on the cross."
"“It is strange to look on this dreadful picture of the mangled corpse
of the Saviour, and to put this question to oneself: ‘Supposing that the
disciples, the future apostles, the women who had followed Him and stood
by the cross, all of whom believed in and worshipped Him--supposing
that they saw this tortured body, this face so mangled and bleeding and
bruised (and they _must_ have so seen it)--how could they have gazed upon
the dreadful sight and yet have believed that He would rise again?’

“The thought steps in, whether one likes it or no, that death is so
terrible and so powerful, that even He who conquered it in His miracles
during life was unable to triumph over it at the last."
"He who called
to Lazarus, ‘Lazarus, come forth!’ and the dead man lived--He was now
Himself a prey to nature and death."
"Nature appears to one, looking at
this picture, as some huge, implacable, dumb monster; or still better--a
stranger simile--some enormous mechanical engine of modern days which
has seized and crushed and swallowed up a great and invaluable Being,
a Being worth nature and all her laws, worth the whole earth, which was
perhaps created merely for the sake of the advent of that Being."
"“This blind, dumb, implacable, eternal, unreasoning force is well shown
in the picture, and the absolute subordination of all men and things to
it is so well expressed that the idea unconsciously arises in the mind
of anyone who looks at it."
"All those faithful people who were gazing at
the cross and its mutilated occupant must have suffered agony of mind
that evening; for they must have felt that all their hopes and almost
all their faith had been shattered at a blow."
"They must have separated
in terror and dread that night, though each perhaps carried away with
him one great thought which was never eradicated from his mind for ever
afterwards."
"If this great Teacher of theirs could have seen Himself
after the Crucifixion, how could He have consented to mount the Cross
and to die as He did?"
"This thought also comes into the mind of the man
who gazes at this picture."
"I thought of all this by snatches probably
between my attacks of delirium--for an hour and a half or so before
Colia’s departure."
“Can there be an appearance of that which has no form?
"And yet it seemed
to me, at certain moments, that I beheld in some strange and impossible
form, that dark, dumb, irresistibly powerful, eternal force."
"“I thought someone led me by the hand and showed me, by the light of
a candle, a huge, loathsome insect, which he assured me was that very
force, that very almighty, dumb, irresistible Power, and laughed at
the indignation with which I received this information."
"In my room they
always light the little lamp before my icon for the night; it gives a
feeble flicker of light, but it is strong enough to see by dimly, and
if you sit just under it you can even read by it."
"I think it was about
twelve or a little past that night."
"I had not slept a wink, and was
lying with my eyes wide open, when suddenly the door opened, and in came
Rogojin."
"“He entered, and shut the door behind him."
"Then he silently gazed at me
and went quickly to the corner of the room where the lamp was burning
and sat down underneath it."
"“I was much surprised, and looked at him expectantly."
“Rogojin only leaned his elbow on the table and silently stared at me.
"So passed two or three minutes, and I recollect that his silence hurt
and offended me very much."
Why did he not speak?
"“That his arrival at this time of night struck me as more or less
strange may possibly be the case; but I remember I was by no means
amazed at it."
"On the contrary, though I had not actually told him my
thought in the morning, yet I know he understood it; and this thought
was of such a character that it would not be anything very remarkable,
if one were to come for further talk about it at any hour of night,
however late."
“I thought he must have come for this purpose.
"“In the morning we had parted not the best of friends; I remember he
looked at me with disagreeable sarcasm once or twice; and this same look
I observed in his eyes now--which was the cause of the annoyance I felt."
"“I did not for a moment suspect that I was delirious and that this
Rogojin was but the result of fever and excitement."
"I had not the
slightest idea of such a theory at first."
“Meanwhile he continued to sit and stare jeeringly at me.
"“I angrily turned round in bed and made up my mind that I would not say
a word unless he did; so I rested silently on my pillow determined to
remain dumb, if it were to last till morning."
"I felt resolved that he
should speak first."
Probably twenty minutes or so passed in this way.
"Suddenly the idea struck me--what if this is an apparition and not
Rogojin himself?"
"“Neither during my illness nor at any previous time had I ever seen an
apparition;--but I had always thought, both when I was a little boy, and
even now, that if I were to see one I should die on the spot--though I
don’t believe in ghosts."
"And yet _now_, when the idea struck me that this
was a ghost and not Rogojin at all, I was not in the least alarmed."
Nay--the thought actually irritated me.
"Strangely enough, the decision
of the question as to whether this were a ghost or Rogojin did not, for
some reason or other, interest me nearly so much as it ought to have
done;--I think I began to muse about something altogether different."
"For
instance, I began to wonder why Rogojin, who had been in dressing-gown
and slippers when I saw him at home, had now put on a dress-coat and
white waistcoat and tie?"
"I also thought to myself, I remember--‘if
this is a ghost, and I am not afraid of it, why don’t I approach it and
verify my suspicions?"
"Perhaps I am afraid--’ And no sooner did this last
idea enter my head than an icy blast blew over me; I felt a chill down
my backbone and my knees shook."
"“At this very moment, as though divining my thoughts, Rogojin raised his
head from his arm and began to part his lips as though he were going to
laugh--but he continued to stare at me as persistently as before."
"“I felt so furious with him at this moment that I longed to rush at
him; but as I had sworn that he should speak first, I continued to lie
still--and the more willingly, as I was still by no means satisfied as
to whether it really was Rogojin or not."
"“I cannot remember how long this lasted; I cannot recollect, either,
whether consciousness forsook me at intervals, or not."
"But at last
Rogojin rose, staring at me as intently as ever, but not smiling any
longer,--and walking very softly, almost on tip-toes, to the door, he
opened it, went out, and shut it behind him."
"“I did not rise from my bed, and I don’t know how long I lay with my
eyes open, thinking."
"I don’t know what I thought about, nor how I fell
asleep or became insensible; but I awoke next morning after nine o’clock
when they knocked at my door."
"My general orders are that if I don’t open
the door and call, by nine o’clock, Matreona is to come and bring my
tea."
"When I now opened the door to her, the thought suddenly struck
me--how could he have come in, since the door was locked?"
"I made
inquiries and found that Rogojin himself could not possibly have come
in, because all our doors were locked for the night."
"“Well, this strange circumstance--which I have described with so
much detail--was the ultimate cause which led me to taking my final
determination."
"So that no logic, or logical deductions, had anything to
do with my resolve;--it was simply a matter of disgust."
"“It was impossible for me to go on living when life was full of such
detestable, strange, tormenting forms."
"This ghost had humiliated
me;--nor could I bear to be subordinate to that dark, horrible force
which was embodied in the form of the loathsome insect."
"It was only
towards evening, when I had quite made up my mind on this point, that I
began to feel easier.”

VII."
“I had a small pocket pistol.
"I had procured it while still a boy, at
that droll age when the stories of duels and highwaymen begin to delight
one, and when one imagines oneself nobly standing fire at some future
day, in a duel."
"“There were a couple of old bullets in the bag which contained the
pistol, and powder enough in an old flask for two or three charges."
"“The pistol was a wretched thing, very crooked and wouldn’t carry
farther than fifteen paces at the most."
"However, it would send your
skull flying well enough if you pressed the muzzle of it against your
temple."
"“I determined to die at Pavlofsk at sunrise, in the park--so as to make
no commotion in the house."
“This ‘explanation’ will make the matter clear enough to the police.
"Students of psychology, and anyone else who likes, may make what they
please of it."
"I should not like this paper, however, to be made public."
"I request the prince to keep a copy himself, and to give a copy to
Aglaya Ivanovna Epanchin."
This is my last will and testament.
"As for
my skeleton, I bequeath it to the Medical Academy for the benefit of
science."
"“I recognize no jurisdiction over myself, and I know that I am now
beyond the power of laws and judges."
“A little while ago a very amusing idea struck me.
"What if I were now to
commit some terrible crime--murder ten fellow-creatures, for instance,
or anything else that is thought most shocking and dreadful in this
world--what a dilemma my judges would be in, with a criminal who only
has a fortnight to live in any case, now that the rack and other forms
of torture are abolished!"
"Why, I should die comfortably in their own
hospital--in a warm, clean room, with an attentive doctor--probably much
more comfortably than I should at home."
"“I don’t understand why people in my position do not oftener indulge in
such ideas--if only for a joke!"
Perhaps they do!
Who knows!
"There are
plenty of merry souls among us!"
"“But though I do not recognize any jurisdiction over myself, still I
know that I shall be judged, when I am nothing but a voiceless lump
of clay; therefore I do not wish to go before I have left a word of
reply--the reply of a free man--not one forced to justify himself--oh
no!"
I have no need to ask forgiveness of anyone.
"I wish to say a word
merely because I happen to desire it of my own free will."
"“Here, in the first place, comes a strange thought!"
"“Who, in the name of what Law, would think of disputing my full personal
right over the fortnight of life left to me?"
"What jurisdiction can
be brought to bear upon the case?"
"Who would wish me, not only to be
sentenced, but to endure the sentence to the end?"
"Surely there exists
no man who would wish such a thing--why should anyone desire it?"
"For
the sake of morality?"
"Well, I can understand that if I were to make
an attempt upon my own life while in the enjoyment of full health and
vigour--my life which might have been ‘useful,’ etc., etc.--morality
might reproach me, according to the old routine, for disposing of my
life without permission--or whatever its tenet may be."
"But now, _now_,
when my sentence is out and my days numbered!"
"How can morality have need
of my last breaths, and why should I die listening to the consolations
offered by the prince, who, without doubt, would not omit to demonstrate
that death is actually a benefactor to me?"
"(Christians like him always
end up with that--it is their pet theory.)"
"And what do they want with
their ridiculous ‘Pavlofsk trees’?"
To sweeten my last hours?
"Cannot they
understand that the more I forget myself, the more I let myself become
attached to these last illusions of life and love, by means of which
they try to hide from me Meyer’s wall, and all that is so plainly
written on it--the more unhappy they make me?"
"What is the use of all
your nature to me--all your parks and trees, your sunsets and sunrises,
your blue skies and your self-satisfied faces--when all this wealth
of beauty and happiness begins with the fact that it accounts me--only
me--one too many!"
"What is the good of all this beauty and glory to me,
when every second, every moment, I cannot but be aware that this little
fly which buzzes around my head in the sun’s rays--even this little fly
is a sharer and participator in all the glory of the universe, and knows
its place and is happy in it;--while I--only I, am an outcast, and have
been blind to the fact hitherto, thanks to my simplicity!"
Oh!
"I know
well how the prince and others would like me, instead of indulging in
all these wicked words of my own, to sing, to the glory and triumph of
morality, that well-known verse of Gilbert’s:

  “‘O, puissent voir longtemps votre beauté sacrée
    Tant d’amis, sourds à mes adieux!"
"Qu’ils meurent pleins de jours, que leur mort soit pleurée,
    Qu’un ami leur ferme les yeux!’

“But believe me, believe me, my simple-hearted friends, that in this
highly moral verse, in this academical blessing to the world in general
in the French language, is hidden the intensest gall and bitterness;
but so well concealed is the venom, that I dare say the poet actually
persuaded himself that his words were full of the tears of pardon and
peace, instead of the bitterness of disappointment and malice, and so
died in the delusion."
"“Do you know there is a limit of ignominy, beyond which man’s
consciousness of shame cannot go, and after which begins satisfaction in
shame?"
"Well, of course humility is a great force in that sense, I admit
that--though not in the sense in which religion accounts humility to be
strength!"
“Religion!--I admit eternal life--and perhaps I always did admit it.
"“Admitted that consciousness is called into existence by the will of a
Higher Power; admitted that this consciousness looks out upon the world
and says ‘I am;’ and admitted that the Higher Power wills that the
consciousness so called into existence, be suddenly extinguished (for
so--for some unexplained reason--it is and must be)--still there comes
the eternal question--why must I be humble through all this?"
"Is it not
enough that I am devoured, without my being expected to bless the
power that devours me?"
"Surely--surely I need not suppose that
Somebody--there--will be offended because I do not wish to live out the
fortnight allowed me?"
I don’t believe it.
"“It is much simpler, and far more likely, to believe that my death
is needed--the death of an insignificant atom--in order to fulfil the
general harmony of the universe--in order to make even some plus or
minus in the sum of existence."
"Just as every day the death of numbers of
beings is necessary because without their annihilation the rest cannot
live on--(although we must admit that the idea is not a particularly
grand one in itself!)"
“However--admit the fact!
"Admit that without such perpetual devouring of
one another the world cannot continue to exist, or could never have been
organized--I am ever ready to confess that I cannot understand why this
is so--but I’ll tell you what I _do_ know, for certain."
"If I have once
been given to understand and realize that I _am_--what does it matter
to me that the world is organized on a system full of errors and that
otherwise it cannot be organized at all?"
"Who will or can judge me after
this?"
Say what you like--the thing is impossible and unjust!
"“And meanwhile I have never been able, in spite of my great desire to
do so, to persuade myself that there is no future existence, and no
Providence."
"“The fact of the matter is that all this _does_ exist, but that we know
absolutely nothing about the future life and its laws!"
"“But it is so difficult, and even impossible to understand, that surely
I am not to be blamed because I could not fathom the incomprehensible?"
"“Of course I know they say that one must be obedient, and of course,
too, the prince is one of those who say so: that one must be obedient
without questions, out of pure goodness of heart, and that for my worthy
conduct in this matter I shall meet with reward in another world."
"We
degrade God when we attribute our own ideas to Him, out of annoyance
that we cannot fathom His ways."
"“Again, I repeat, I cannot be blamed because I am unable to understand
that which it is not given to mankind to fathom."
"Why am I to be judged
because I could not comprehend the Will and Laws of Providence?"
"No, we
had better drop religion."
“And enough of this.
"By the time I have got so far in the reading of
my document the sun will be up and the huge force of his rays will be
acting upon the living world."
So be it.
"I shall die gazing straight at
the great Fountain of life and power; I do not want this life!"
"“If I had had the power to prevent my own birth I should certainly never
have consented to accept existence under such ridiculous conditions."
"However, I have the power to end my existence, although I do but give
back days that are already numbered."
"It is an insignificant gift, and my
revolt is equally insignificant."
"“Final explanation: I die, not in the least because I am unable to
support these next three weeks."
"Oh no, I should find strength enough,
and if I wished it I could obtain consolation from the thought of the
injury that is done me."
"But I am not a French poet, and I do not desire
such consolation."
"And finally, nature has so limited my capacity for
work or activity of any kind, in allotting me but three weeks of time,
that suicide is about the only thing left that I can begin and end in
the time of my own free will."
"“Perhaps then I am anxious to take advantage of my last chance of doing
something for myself."
"A protest is sometimes no small thing.”

The explanation was finished; Hippolyte paused at last."
"There is, in extreme cases, a final stage of cynical candour when a
nervous man, excited, and beside himself with emotion, will be afraid
of nothing and ready for any sort of scandal, nay, glad of it."
"The
extraordinary, almost unnatural, tension of the nerves which upheld
Hippolyte up to this point, had now arrived at this final stage."
"This
poor feeble boy of eighteen--exhausted by disease--looked for all the
world as weak and frail as a leaflet torn from its parent tree and
trembling in the breeze; but no sooner had his eye swept over his
audience, for the first time during the whole of the last hour, than the
most contemptuous, the most haughty expression of repugnance lighted
up his face."
"He defied them all, as it were."
"But his hearers were
indignant, too; they rose to their feet with annoyance."
"Fatigue,
the wine consumed, the strain of listening so long, all added to the
disagreeable impression which the reading had made upon them."
Suddenly Hippolyte jumped up as though he had been shot.
"“The sun is rising,” he cried, seeing the gilded tops of the trees, and
pointing to them as to a miracle."
"“See, it is rising now!”

“Well, what then?"
"Did you suppose it wasn’t going to rise?” asked
Ferdishenko."
"“It’s going to be atrociously hot again all day,” said Gania, with an
air of annoyance, taking his hat."
"“A month of this... Are you coming
home, Ptitsin?” Hippolyte listened to this in amazement, almost
amounting to stupefaction."
Suddenly he became deadly pale and shuddered.
“You manage your composure too awkwardly.
"I see you wish to insult me,”
 he cried to Gania."
"“You--you are a cur!” He looked at Gania with an
expression of malice."
“What on earth is the matter with the boy?
"What phenomenal
feeble-mindedness!” exclaimed Ferdishenko."
"“Oh, he’s simply a fool,” said Gania."
Hippolyte braced himself up a little.
"“I understand, gentlemen,” he began, trembling as before, and stumbling
over every word, “that I have deserved your resentment, and--and
am sorry that I should have troubled you with this raving nonsense”
 (pointing to his article), “or rather, I am sorry that I have not
troubled you enough.” He smiled feebly."
"“Have I troubled you, Evgenie
Pavlovitch?” He suddenly turned on Evgenie with this question."
"“Tell me
now, have I troubled you or not?”

“Well, it was a little drawn out, perhaps; but--”

“Come, speak out!"
"Don’t lie, for once in your life--speak out!”
 continued Hippolyte, quivering with agitation."
"“Oh, my good sir, I assure you it’s entirely the same to me."
"Please
leave me in peace,” said Evgenie, angrily, turning his back on him."
"“Good-night, prince,” said Ptitsin, approaching his host."
“What are you thinking of?
"Don’t go, he’ll blow his brains out in a
minute!” cried Vera Lebedeff, rushing up to Hippolyte and catching hold
of his hands in a torment of alarm."
“What are you thinking of?
"He said
he would blow his brains out at sunrise.”

“Oh, he won’t shoot himself!” cried several voices, sarcastically."
"“Gentlemen, you’d better look out,” cried Colia, also seizing Hippolyte
by the hand."
“Just look at him!
"Prince, what are you thinking of?” Vera
and Colia, and Keller, and Burdovsky were all crowding round Hippolyte
now and holding him down."
“He has the right--the right--” murmured Burdovsky.
"“Excuse me, prince,
but what are your arrangements?” asked Lebedeff, tipsy and exasperated,
going up to Muishkin."
"“What do you mean by ‘arrangements’?”

“No, no, excuse me!"
"I’m master of this house, though I do not wish to
lack respect towards you."
"You are master of the house too, in a way; but
I can’t allow this sort of thing--”

“He won’t shoot himself; the boy is only playing the fool,” said General
Ivolgin, suddenly and unexpectedly, with indignation."
"“I know he won’t, I know he won’t, general; but I--I’m master here!”

“Listen, Mr. Terentieff,” said Ptitsin, who had bidden the prince
good-night, and was now holding out his hand to Hippolyte; “I think you
remark in that manuscript of yours, that you bequeath your skeleton to
the Academy."
"Are you referring to your own skeleton--I mean, your very
bones?”

“Yes, my bones, I--”

“Quite so, I see; because, you know, little mistakes have occurred now
and then."
"There was a case--”

“Why do you tease him?” cried the prince, suddenly."
"“You’ve moved him to tears,” added Ferdishenko."
"But Hippolyte was by no
means weeping."
"He was about to move from his place, when his four guards
rushed at him and seized him once more."
There was a laugh at this.
“He led up to this on purpose.
"He took the trouble of writing all that
so that people should come and grab him by the arm,” observed Rogojin."
"“Good-night, prince."
"What a time we’ve sat here, my very bones ache!”

“If you really intended to shoot yourself, Terentieff,” said Evgenie
Pavlovitch, laughing, “if I were you, after all these compliments, I
should just not shoot myself in order to vex them all.”

“They are very anxious to see me blow my brains out,” said Hippolyte,
bitterly."
"“Yes, they’ll be awfully annoyed if they don’t see it.”

“Then you think they won’t see it?”

“I am not trying to egg you on."
"On the contrary, I think it very likely
that you may shoot yourself; but the principal thing is to keep cool,”
 said Evgenie with a drawl, and with great condescension."
"“I only now perceive what a terrible mistake I made in reading this
article to them,” said Hippolyte, suddenly, addressing Evgenie, and
looking at him with an expression of trust and confidence, as though he
were applying to a friend for counsel."
"“Yes, it’s a droll situation; I really don’t know what advice to give
you,” replied Evgenie, laughing."
"Hippolyte gazed steadfastly at him,
but said nothing."
"To look at him one might have supposed that he was
unconscious at intervals."
"“Excuse me,” said Lebedeff, “but did you observe the young gentleman’s
style?"
"‘I’ll go and blow my brains out in the park,’ says he, ‘so as not
to disturb anyone.’ He thinks he won’t disturb anybody if he goes three
yards away, into the park, and blows his brains out there.”

“Gentlemen--” began the prince."
"“No, no, excuse me, most revered prince,” Lebedeff interrupted,
excitedly."
"“Since you must have observed yourself that this is no joke,
and since at least half your guests must also have concluded that after
all that has been said this youth _must_ blow his brains out for honour’s
sake--I--as master of this house, and before these witnesses, now call
upon you to take steps.”

“Yes, but what am I to do, Lebedeff?"
What steps am I to take?
"I am
ready.”

“I’ll tell you."
"In the first place he must immediately deliver up the
pistol which he boasted of, with all its appurtenances."
"If he does
this I shall consent to his being allowed to spend the night in
this house--considering his feeble state of health, and of course
conditionally upon his being under proper supervision."
"But tomorrow he
must go elsewhere."
"Excuse me, prince!"
"Should he refuse to deliver up his
weapon, then I shall instantly seize one of his arms and General Ivolgin
the other, and we shall hold him until the police arrive and take the
matter into their own hands."
"Mr. Ferdishenko will kindly fetch them.”

At this there was a dreadful noise; Lebedeff danced about in his
excitement; Ferdishenko prepared to go for the police; Gania frantically
insisted that it was all nonsense, “for nobody was going to shoot
themselves.” Evgenie Pavlovitch said nothing."
"“Prince,” whispered Hippolyte, suddenly, his eyes all ablaze, “you don’t
suppose that I did not foresee all this hatred?” He looked at the prince
as though he expected him to reply, for a moment."
"“Enough!” he added at
length, and addressing the whole company, he cried: “It’s all my fault,
gentlemen!"
"Lebedeff, here’s the key,” (he took out a small bunch of
keys); “this one, the last but one--Colia will show you--Colia, where’s
Colia?” he cried, looking straight at Colia and not seeing him."
"“Yes,
he’ll show you; he packed the bag with me this morning."
"Take him up,
Colia; my bag is upstairs in the prince’s study, under the table."
"Here’s
the key, and in the little case you’ll find my pistol and the powder,
and all."
"Colia packed it himself, Mr. Lebedeff; he’ll show you; but it’s
on condition that tomorrow morning, when I leave for Petersburg, you
will give me back my pistol, do you hear?"
"I do this for the prince’s
sake, not yours.”

“Capital, that’s much better!” cried Lebedeff, and seizing the key he
made off in haste."
"Colia stopped a moment as though he wished to say something; but
Lebedeff dragged him away."
Hippolyte looked around at the laughing guests.
"The prince observed that
his teeth were chattering as though in a violent attack of ague."
“What brutes they all are!” he whispered to the prince.
"Whenever he
addressed him he lowered his voice."
"“Let them alone, you’re too weak now--”

“Yes, directly; I’ll go away directly."
"I’ll--”

Suddenly he embraced Muishkin."
"“Perhaps you think I am mad, eh?” he asked him, laughing very strangely."
"“No, but you--”

“Directly, directly!"
"Stand still a moment, I wish to look in your eyes;
don’t speak--stand so--let me look at you!"
"I am bidding farewell to
mankind.”

He stood so for ten seconds, gazing at the prince, motionless, deadly
pale, his temples wet with perspiration; he held the prince’s hand in a
strange grip, as though afraid to let him go."
"“Hippolyte, Hippolyte, what is the matter with you?” cried Muishkin."
“Directly!
"There, that’s enough."
I’ll lie down directly.
"I must drink to
the sun’s health."
I wish to--I insist upon it!
"Let go!”

He seized a glass from the table, broke away from the prince, and in a
moment had reached the terrace steps."
"The prince made after him, but it so happened that at this moment
Evgenie Pavlovitch stretched out his hand to say good-night."
"The next
instant there was a general outcry, and then followed a few moments of
indescribable excitement."
"Reaching the steps, Hippolyte had paused, holding the glass in his left
hand while he put his right hand into his coat pocket."
"Keller insisted afterwards that he had held his right hand in his pocket
all the while, when he was speaking to the prince, and that he had held
the latter’s shoulder with his left hand only."
"This circumstance, Keller
affirmed, had led him to feel some suspicion from the first."
"However
this may be, Keller ran after Hippolyte, but he was too late."
"He caught sight of something flashing in Hippolyte’s right hand, and
saw that it was a pistol."
"He rushed at him, but at that very instant
Hippolyte raised the pistol to his temple and pulled the trigger."
"There
followed a sharp metallic click, but no report."
"When Keller seized the would-be suicide, the latter fell forward into
his arms, probably actually believing that he was shot."
"Keller had hold
of the pistol now."
"Hippolyte was immediately placed in a chair, while
the whole company thronged around excitedly, talking and asking each
other questions."
"Every one of them had heard the snap of the trigger,
and yet they saw a live and apparently unharmed man before them."
"Hippolyte himself sat quite unconscious of what was going on, and gazed
around with a senseless expression."
Lebedeff and Colia came rushing up at this moment.
"“What is it?” someone asked, breathlessly--“A misfire?”

“Perhaps it wasn’t loaded,” said several voices."
"“It’s loaded all right,” said Keller, examining the pistol, “but--”

“What!"
"did it miss fire?”

“There was no cap in it,” Keller announced."
It would be difficult to describe the pitiable scene that now followed.
"The first sensation of alarm soon gave place to amusement; some
burst out laughing loud and heartily, and seemed to find a malicious
satisfaction in the joke."
"Poor Hippolyte sobbed hysterically; he wrung
his hands; he approached everyone in turn--even Ferdishenko--and took
them by both hands, and swore solemnly that he had forgotten--absolutely
forgotten--“accidentally, and not on purpose,”--to put a cap in--that
he “had ten of them, at least, in his pocket.” He pulled them out and
showed them to everyone; he protested that he had not liked to put one
in beforehand for fear of an accidental explosion in his pocket."
"That
he had thought he would have lots of time to put it in afterwards--when
required--and, that, in the heat of the moment, he had forgotten all
about it."
"He threw himself upon the prince, then on Evgenie Pavlovitch."
"He entreated Keller to give him back the pistol, and he’d soon show them
all that “his honour--his honour,”--but he was “dishonoured, now, for
ever!”

He fell senseless at last--and was carried into the prince’s study."
"Lebedeff, now quite sobered down, sent for a doctor; and he and his
daughter, with Burdovsky and General Ivolgin, remained by the sick man’s
couch."
"When he was carried away unconscious, Keller stood in the middle of the
room, and made the following declaration to the company in general, in a
loud tone of voice, with emphasis upon each word."
"“Gentlemen, if any one of you casts any doubt again, before me,
upon Hippolyte’s good faith, or hints that the cap was forgotten
intentionally, or suggests that this unhappy boy was acting a part
before us, I beg to announce that the person so speaking shall account
to me for his words.”

No one replied."
"The company departed very quickly, in a mass."
"Ptitsin, Gania, and
Rogojin went away together."
"The prince was much astonished that Evgenie Pavlovitch changed his mind,
and took his departure without the conversation he had requested."
"“Why, you wished to have a talk with me when the others left?” he said."
"“Quite so,” said Evgenie, sitting down suddenly beside him, “but I have
changed my mind for the time being."
"I confess, I am too disturbed, and
so, I think, are you; and the matter as to which I wished to consult you
is too serious to tackle with one’s mind even a little disturbed; too
serious both for myself and for you."
"You see, prince, for once in my
life I wish to perform an absolutely honest action, that is, an action
with no ulterior motive; and I think I am hardly in a condition to talk
of it just at this moment, and--and--well, we’ll discuss it another
time."
"Perhaps the matter may gain in clearness if we wait for two
or three days--just the two or three days which I must spend in
Petersburg.”

Here he rose again from his chair, so that it seemed strange that he
should have thought it worth while to sit down at all."
"The prince thought, too, that he looked vexed and annoyed, and not
nearly so friendly towards himself as he had been earlier in the night."
“I suppose you will go to the sufferer’s bedside now?” he added.
"“Yes, I am afraid...” began the prince."
"“Oh, you needn’t fear!"
He’ll live another six weeks all right.
"Very
likely he will recover altogether; but I strongly advise you to pack him
off tomorrow.”

“I think I may have offended him by saying nothing just now."
"I am afraid
he may suspect that I doubted his good faith,--about shooting himself,
you know."
"What do you think, Evgenie Pavlovitch?”

“Not a bit of it!"
"You are much too good to him; you shouldn’t care a
hang about what he thinks."
"I have heard of such things before, but never
came across, till tonight, a man who would actually shoot himself in
order to gain a vulgar notoriety, or blow out his brains for spite,
if he finds that people don’t care to pat him on the back for his
sanguinary intentions."
"But what astonishes me more than anything is
the fellow’s candid confession of weakness."
"You’d better get rid of him
tomorrow, in any case.”

“Do you think he will make another attempt?”

“Oh no, not he, not now!"
"But you have to be very careful with this
sort of gentleman."
"Crime is too often the last resource of these petty
nonentities."
"This young fellow is quite capable of cutting the throats
of ten people, simply for a lark, as he told us in his ‘explanation.’ I
assure you those confounded words of his will not let me sleep.”

“I think you disturb yourself too much.”

“What an extraordinary person you are, prince!"
"Do you mean to say that
you doubt the fact that he is capable of murdering ten men?”

“I daren’t say, one way or the other; all this is very strange--but--”

“Well, as you like, just as you like,” said Evgenie Pavlovitch,
irritably."
"“Only you are such a plucky fellow, take care you don’t get
included among the ten victims!”

“Oh, he is much more likely not to kill anyone at all,” said the prince,
gazing thoughtfully at Evgenie."
The latter laughed disagreeably.
"“Well, _au revoir!_ Did you observe that he ‘willed’ a copy of his
confession to Aglaya Ivanovna?”

“Yes, I did; I am thinking of it.”

“In connection with ‘the ten,’ eh?” laughed Evgenie, as he left the
room."
"An hour later, towards four o’clock, the prince went into the park."
"He had endeavoured to fall asleep, but could not, owing to the painful
beating of his heart."
"He had left things quiet and peaceful; the invalid was fast asleep, and
the doctor, who had been called in, had stated that there was no special
danger."
"Lebedeff, Colia, and Burdovsky were lying down in the sick-room,
ready to take it in turns to watch."
"There was nothing to fear,
therefore, at home."
But the prince’s mental perturbation increased every moment.
"He wandered
about the park, looking absently around him, and paused in astonishment
when he suddenly found himself in the empty space with the rows of
chairs round it, near the Vauxhall."
"The look of the place struck him
as dreadful now: so he turned round and went by the path which he had
followed with the Epanchins on the way to the band, until he reached the
green bench which Aglaya had pointed out for their rendezvous."
"He sat
down on it and suddenly burst into a loud fit of laughter, immediately
followed by a feeling of irritation."
"His disturbance of mind continued;
he felt that he must go away somewhere, anywhere."
"Above his head some little bird sang out, of a sudden; he began to peer
about for it among the leaves."
"Suddenly the bird darted out of the tree
and away, and instantly he thought of the “fly buzzing about in the
sun’s rays” that Hippolyte had talked of; how that it knew its place
and was a participator in the universal life, while he alone was an
“outcast.” This picture had impressed him at the time, and he meditated
upon it now."
"An old, forgotten memory awoke in his brain, and suddenly
burst into clearness and light."
"It was a recollection of Switzerland,
during the first year of his cure, the very first months."
"At that time
he had been pretty nearly an idiot still; he could not speak properly,
and had difficulty in understanding when others spoke to him."
"He climbed
the mountain-side, one sunny morning, and wandered long and aimlessly
with a certain thought in his brain, which would not become clear."
"Above
him was the blazing sky, below, the lake; all around was the horizon,
clear and infinite."
"He looked out upon this, long and anxiously."
"He
remembered how he had stretched out his arms towards the beautiful,
boundless blue of the horizon, and wept, and wept."
"What had so tormented
him was the idea that he was a stranger to all this, that he was outside
this glorious festival."
What was this universe?
"What was this grand, eternal pageant to which
he had yearned from his childhood up, and in which he could never take
part?"
"Every morning the same magnificent sun; every morning the
same rainbow in the waterfall; every evening the same glow on the
snow-mountains."
"Every little fly that buzzed in the sun’s rays was a singer in the
universal chorus, “knew its place, and was happy in it.” Every blade of
grass grew and was happy."
"Everything knew its path and loved it, went
forth with a song and returned with a song; only he knew nothing,
understood nothing, neither men nor words, nor any of nature’s voices;
he was a stranger and an outcast."
"Oh, he could not then speak these words, or express all he felt!"
"He had
been tormented dumbly; but now it appeared to him that he must have
said these very words--even then--and that Hippolyte must have taken his
picture of the little fly from his tears and words of that time."
"He was sure of it, and his heart beat excitedly at the thought, he knew
not why."
"He fell asleep on the bench; but his mental disquiet continued through
his slumbers."
"Just before he dozed off, the idea of Hippolyte murdering ten men
flitted through his brain, and he smiled at the absurdity of such a
thought."
"Around him all was quiet; only the flutter and whisper of the leaves
broke the silence, but broke it only to cause it to appear yet more deep
and still."
"He dreamed many dreams as he sat there, and all were full of disquiet,
so that he shuddered every moment."
At length a woman seemed to approach him.
"He knew her, oh!"
"he knew her
only too well."
"He could always name her and recognize her anywhere; but,
strange, she seemed to have quite a different face from hers, as he had
known it, and he felt a tormenting desire to be able to say she was not
the same woman."
"In the face before him there was such dreadful remorse
and horror that he thought she must be a criminal, that she must have
just committed some awful crime."
Tears were trembling on her white cheek.
"She beckoned him, but placed
her finger on her lip as though to warn him that he must follow her very
quietly."
His heart froze within him.
"He wouldn’t, he _couldn’t_ confess
her to be a criminal, and yet he felt that something dreadful would
happen the next moment, something which would blast his whole life."
"She seemed to wish to show him something, not far off, in the park."
"He rose from his seat in order to follow her, when a bright, clear peal
of laughter rang out by his side."
"He felt somebody’s hand suddenly in
his own, seized it, pressed it hard, and awoke."
"Before him stood Aglaya,
laughing aloud."
VIII.
"She laughed, but she was rather angry too."
“He’s asleep!
"You were asleep,” she said, with contemptuous surprise."
"“Is it really you?” muttered the prince, not quite himself as yet,
and recognizing her with a start of amazement."
"“Oh yes, of course,” he
added, “this is our rendezvous."
"I fell asleep here.”

“So I saw.”

“Did no one awake me besides yourself?"
Was there no one else here?
"I
thought there was another woman.”

“There was another woman here?”

At last he was wide awake."
"“It was a dream, of course,” he said, musingly."
"“Strange that I should
have a dream like that at such a moment."
"Sit down--”

He took her hand and seated her on the bench; then sat down beside her
and reflected."
"Aglaya did not begin the conversation, but contented herself with
watching her companion intently."
"He looked back at her, but at times it was clear that he did not see her
and was not thinking of her."
Aglaya began to flush up.
"“Oh yes!” cried the prince, starting."
"“Hippolyte’s suicide--”

“What?"
"At your house?” she asked, but without much surprise."
"“He was
alive yesterday evening, wasn’t he?"
"How could you sleep here after
that?” she cried, growing suddenly animated."
"“Oh, but he didn’t kill himself; the pistol didn’t go off.” Aglaya
insisted on hearing the whole story."
"She hurried the prince along, but
interrupted him with all sorts of questions, nearly all of which were
irrelevant."
"Among other things, she seemed greatly interested in every
word that Evgenie Pavlovitch had said, and made the prince repeat that
part of the story over and over again."
"“Well, that’ll do; we must be quick,” she concluded, after hearing all."
"“We have only an hour here, till eight; I must be home by then without
fail, so that they may not find out that I came and sat here with you;
but I’ve come on business."
I have a great deal to say to you.
"But you
have bowled me over considerably with your news."
"As to Hippolyte, I
think his pistol was bound not to go off; it was more consistent with
the whole affair."
"Are you sure he really wished to blow his brains out,
and that there was no humbug about the matter?”

“No humbug at all.”

“Very likely."
"So he wrote that you were to bring me a copy of his
confession, did he?"
"Why didn’t you bring it?”

“Why, he didn’t die!"
"I’ll ask him for it, if you like.”

“Bring it by all means; you needn’t ask him."
"He will be delighted, you
may be sure; for, in all probability, he shot at himself simply in order
that I might read his confession."
"Don’t laugh at what I say, please, Lef
Nicolaievitch, because it may very well be the case.”

“I’m not laughing."
"I am convinced, myself, that that may have been
partly the reason.”

“You are convinced?"
"You don’t really mean to say you think that
honestly?” asked Aglaya, extremely surprised."
"She put her questions very quickly and talked fast, every now and then
forgetting what she had begun to say, and not finishing her sentence."
She seemed to be impatient to warn the prince about something or other.
"She was in a state of unusual excitement, and though she put on a brave
and even defiant air, she seemed to be rather alarmed."
"She was dressed
very simply, but this suited her well."
"She continually trembled and
blushed, and she sat on the very edge of the seat."
"The fact that the prince confirmed her idea, about Hippolyte shooting
himself that she might read his confession, surprised her greatly."
"“Of course,” added the prince, “he wished us all to applaud his
conduct--besides yourself.”

“How do you mean--applaud?”

“Well--how am I to explain?"
"He was very anxious that we should all come
around him, and say we were so sorry for him, and that we loved him
very much, and all that; and that we hoped he wouldn’t kill himself, but
remain alive."
"Very likely he thought more of you than the rest of us,
because he mentioned you at such a moment, though perhaps he did not
know himself that he had you in his mind’s eye.”

“I don’t understand you."
"How could he have me in view, and not be aware
of it himself?"
"And yet, I don’t know--perhaps I do."
"Do you know I
have intended to poison myself at least thirty times--ever since I was
thirteen or so--and to write to my parents before I did it?"
"I used
to think how nice it would be to lie in my coffin, and have them all
weeping over me and saying it was all their fault for being so cruel,
and all that--what are you smiling at?” she added, knitting her brow."
“What do _you_ think of when you go mooning about alone?
"I suppose
you imagine yourself a field-marshal, and think you have conquered
Napoleon?”

“Well, I really have thought something of the sort now and then,
especially when just dozing off,” laughed the prince."
"“Only it is the
Austrians whom I conquer--not Napoleon.”

“I don’t wish to joke with you, Lef Nicolaievitch."
"I shall see Hippolyte
myself."
Tell him so.
"As for you, I think you are behaving very badly,
because it is not right to judge a man’s soul as you are judging
Hippolyte’s."
"You have no gentleness, but only justice--so you are
unjust.”

The prince reflected."
"“I think you are unfair towards me,” he said."
"“There is nothing wrong
in the thoughts I ascribe to Hippolyte; they are only natural."
"But of
course I don’t know for certain what he thought."
"Perhaps he thought
nothing, but simply longed to see human faces once more, and to hear
human praise and feel human affection."
Who knows?
"Only it all came out
wrong, somehow."
"Some people have luck, and everything comes out right
with them; others have none, and never a thing turns out fortunately.”

“I suppose you have felt that in your own case,” said Aglaya."
"“Yes, I have,” replied the prince, quite unsuspicious of any irony in
the remark."
"“H’m--well, at all events, I shouldn’t have fallen asleep here, in your
place."
"It wasn’t nice of you, that."
"I suppose you fall asleep wherever
you sit down?”

“But I didn’t sleep a wink all night."
"I walked and walked about, and
went to where the music was--”

“What music?”

“Where they played last night."
"Then I found this bench and sat down, and
thought and thought--and at last I fell fast asleep.”

“Oh, is that it?"
"That makes a difference, perhaps."
"What did you go to
the bandstand for?”

“I don’t know; I--”

“Very well--afterwards."
You are always interrupting me.
"What woman was
it you were dreaming about?”

“It was--about--you saw her--”

“Quite so; I understand."
I understand quite well.
"You are very--Well,
how did she appear to you?"
What did she look like?
"No, I don’t want to
know anything about her,” said Aglaya, angrily; “don’t interrupt me--”

She paused a moment as though getting breath, or trying to master her
feeling of annoyance."
“Look here; this is what I called you here for.
"I wish to make you a--to
ask you to be my friend."
"What do you stare at me like that for?” she
added, almost angrily."
"The prince certainly had darted a rather piercing look at her, and now
observed that she had begun to blush violently."
"At such moments, the
more Aglaya blushed, the angrier she grew with herself; and this was
clearly expressed in her eyes, which flashed like fire."
"As a rule, she
vented her wrath on her unfortunate companion, be it who it might."
"She
was very conscious of her own shyness, and was not nearly so talkative
as her sisters for this reason--in fact, at times she was much too
quiet."
"When, therefore, she was bound to talk, especially at such
delicate moments as this, she invariably did so with an air of haughty
defiance."
"She always knew beforehand when she was going to blush, long
before the blush came."
"“Perhaps you do not wish to accept my proposition?” she asked, gazing
haughtily at the prince."
"“Oh yes, I do; but it is so unnecessary."
"I mean, I did not think you
need make such a proposition,” said the prince, looking confused."
"“What did you suppose, then?"
Why did you think I invited you out here?
"I
suppose you think me a ‘little fool,’ as they all call me at home?”

“I didn’t know they called you a fool."
"I certainly don’t think you one.”

“You don’t think me one!"
"Oh, dear me!--that’s very clever of you; you
put it so neatly, too.”

“In my opinion, you are far from a fool sometimes--in fact, you are very
intelligent."
"You said a very clever thing just now about my being unjust
because I had _only_ justice."
"I shall remember that, and think about it.”

Aglaya blushed with pleasure."
"All these changes in her expression came
about so naturally and so rapidly--they delighted the prince; he watched
her, and laughed."
"“Listen,” she began again; “I have long waited to tell you all this,
ever since the time when you sent me that letter--even before that."
Half of what I have to say you heard yesterday.
"I consider you the most
honest and upright of men--more honest and upright than any other
man; and if anybody says that your mind is--is sometimes affected, you
know--it is unfair."
"I always say so and uphold it, because even if your
surface mind be a little affected (of course you will not feel angry
with me for talking so--I am speaking from a higher point of view) yet
your real mind is far better than all theirs put together."
"Such a
mind as they have never even _dreamed_ of; because really, there are
_two_ minds--the kind that matters, and the kind that doesn’t matter."
"Isn’t it so?”

“May be!"
"may be so!” said the prince, faintly; his heart was beating
painfully."
"“I knew you would not misunderstand me,” she said, triumphantly."
"“Prince
S. and Evgenie Pavlovitch and Alexandra don’t understand anything about
these two kinds of mind, but, just fancy, mamma does!”

“You are very like Lizabetha Prokofievna.”

“What!"
surely not?” said Aglaya.
"“Yes, you are, indeed.”

“Thank you; I am glad to be like mamma,” she said, thoughtfully."
"“You
respect her very much, don’t you?” she added, quite unconscious of the
naiveness of the question."
"“_Very_ much; and I am so glad that you have realized the fact.”

“I am very glad, too, because she is often laughed at by people."
"But
listen to the chief point."
"I have long thought over the matter, and at
last I have chosen you."
"I don’t wish people to laugh at me; I don’t wish
people to think me a ‘little fool.’ I don’t want to be chaffed."
"I felt
all this of a sudden, and I refused Evgenie Pavlovitch flatly, because
I am not going to be forever thrown at people’s heads to be married."
"I
want--I want--well, I’ll tell you, I wish to run away from home, and I
have chosen you to help me.”

“Run away from home?” cried the prince."
“Yes--yes--yes!
"Run away from home!” she repeated, in a transport of
rage."
"“I won’t, I won’t be made to blush every minute by them all!"
"I
don’t want to blush before Prince S. or Evgenie Pavlovitch, or
anyone, and therefore I have chosen you."
"I shall tell you everything,
_everything_, even the most important things of all, whenever I like,
and you are to hide nothing from me on your side."
"I want to speak to at
least one person, as I would to myself."
"They have suddenly begun to say
that I am waiting for you, and in love with you."
"They began this before
you arrived here, and so I didn’t show them the letter, and now they all
say it, every one of them."
"I want to be brave, and be afraid of nobody."
I don’t want to go to their balls and things--I want to do good.
"I have
long desired to run away, for I have been kept shut up for twenty years,
and they are always trying to marry me off."
"I wanted to run away when I
was fourteen years old--I was a little fool then, I know--but now I have
worked it all out, and I have waited for you to tell me about foreign
countries."
I have never seen a single Gothic cathedral.
"I must go to
Rome; I must see all the museums; I must study in Paris."
"All this last
year I have been preparing and reading forbidden books."
"Alexandra and
Adelaida are allowed to read anything they like, but I mayn’t."
"I don’t
want to quarrel with my sisters, but I told my parents long ago that I
wish to change my social position."
"I have decided to take up teaching,
and I count on you because you said you loved children."
"Can we go in for
education together--if not at once, then afterwards?"
"We could do good
together."
I won’t be a general’s daughter any more!
"Tell me, are you a
very learned man?”

“Oh no; not at all.”

“Oh-h-h!"
I’m sorry for that.
I thought you were.
"I wonder why I always
thought so--but at all events you’ll help me, won’t you?"
"Because I’ve
chosen you, you know.”

“Aglaya Ivanovna, it’s absurd.”

“But I will, I _will_ run away!” she cried--and her eyes flashed again
with anger--“and if you don’t agree I shall go and marry Gavrila
Ardalionovitch!"
"I won’t be considered a horrible girl, and accused of
goodness knows what.”

“Are you out of your mind?” cried the prince, almost starting from his
seat."
“What do they accuse you of?
"Who accuses you?”

“At home, everybody, mother, my sisters, Prince S., even that detestable
Colia!"
"If they don’t say it, they think it."
"I told them all so to their
faces."
I told mother and father and everybody.
"Mamma was ill all the
day after it, and next day father and Alexandra told me that I didn’t
understand what nonsense I was talking."
"I informed them that they
little knew me--I was not a small child--I understood every word in the
language--that I had read a couple of Paul de Kok’s novels two years
since on purpose, so as to know all about everything."
"No sooner did
mamma hear me say this than she nearly fainted!”

A strange thought passed through the prince’s brain; he gazed intently
at Aglaya and smiled."
"He could not believe that this was the same haughty young girl who had
once so proudly shown him Gania’s letter."
"He could not understand how
that proud and austere beauty could show herself to be such an utter
child--a child who probably did not even now understand some words."
"“Have you always lived at home, Aglaya Ivanovna?” he asked."
"“I mean,
have you never been to school, or college, or anything?”

“No--never--nowhere!"
"I’ve been at home all my life, corked up in a
bottle; and they expect me to be married straight out of it."
"What are
you laughing at again?"
"I observe that you, too, have taken to laughing
at me, and range yourself on their side against me,” she added, frowning
angrily."
"“Don’t irritate me--I’m bad enough without that--I don’t know
what I am doing sometimes."
"I am persuaded that you came here today in
the full belief that I am in love with you, and that I arranged this
meeting because of that,” she cried, with annoyance."
"“I admit I was afraid that that was the case, yesterday,” blundered the
prince (he was rather confused), “but today I am quite convinced that--”

“How?” cried Aglaya--and her lower lip trembled violently."
"“You were
_afraid_ that I--you dared to think that I--good gracious!"
"you suspected,
perhaps, that I sent for you to come here in order to catch you in a
trap, so that they should find us here together, and make you marry
me--”

“Aglaya Ivanovna, aren’t you ashamed of saying such a thing?"
"How could
such a horrible idea enter your sweet, innocent heart?"
"I am certain you
don’t believe a word of what you say, and probably you don’t even know
what you are talking about.”

Aglaya sat with her eyes on the ground; she seemed to have alarmed even
herself by what she had said."
"“No, I’m not; I’m not a bit ashamed!” she murmured."
"“And how do you
know my heart is innocent?"
"And how dared you send me a love-letter that
time?”

“_Love-letter?_ My letter a love-letter?"
"That letter was the most
respectful of letters; it went straight from my heart, at what was
perhaps the most painful moment of my life!"
"I thought of you at the time
as a kind of light."
"I--”

“Well, very well, very well!” she said, but quite in a different tone."
"She was remorseful now, and bent forward to touch his shoulder, though
still trying not to look him in the face, as if the more persuasively
to beg him not to be angry with her."
"“Very well,” she continued, looking
thoroughly ashamed of herself, “I feel that I said a very foolish thing."
I only did it just to try you.
"Take it as unsaid, and if I offended you,
forgive me."
"Don’t look straight at me like that, please; turn your head
away."
You called it a ‘horrible idea’; I only said it to shock you.
"Very often I am myself afraid of saying what I intend to say, and out it
comes all the same."
"You have just told me that you wrote that letter at
the most painful moment of your life."
"I know what moment that was!” she
added softly, looking at the ground again."
"“Oh, if you could know all!”

“I _do_ know all!” she cried, with another burst of indignation."
"“You were
living in the same house as that horrible woman with whom you ran away.”
 She did not blush as she said this; on the contrary, she grew pale,
and started from her seat, apparently oblivious of what she did, and
immediately sat down again."
"Her lip continued to tremble for a long
time."
There was silence for a moment.
"The prince was taken aback by the
suddenness of this last reply, and did not know to what he should
attribute it."
"“I don’t love you a bit!” she said suddenly, just as though the words
had exploded from her mouth."
"The prince did not answer, and there was silence again."
"“I love Gavrila
Ardalionovitch,” she said, quickly; but hardly audibly, and with her
head bent lower than ever."
"“That is _not_ true,” said the prince, in an equally low voice."
“What!
"I tell stories, do I?"
It is true!
"I gave him my promise a couple
of days ago on this very seat.”

The prince was startled, and reflected for a moment."
"“It is not true,” he repeated, decidedly; “you have just invented it!”

“You are wonderfully polite."
You know he is greatly improved.
"He loves
me better than his life."
"He let his hand burn before my very eyes in
order to prove to me that he loved me better than his life!”

“He burned his hand!”

“Yes, believe it or not!"
"It’s all the same to me!”

The prince sat silent once more."
"Aglaya did not seem to be joking; she
was too angry for that."
“What!
he brought a candle with him to this place?
"That is, if the
episode happened here; otherwise I can’t.”

“Yes, a candle!"
"What’s there improbable about that?”

“A whole one, and in a candlestick?”

“Yes--no--half a candle--an end, you know--no, it was a whole candle;
it’s all the same."
"Be quiet, can’t you!"
"He brought a box of matches too,
if you like, and then lighted the candle and held his finger in it for
half an hour and more!--There!"
"Can’t that be?”

“I saw him yesterday, and his fingers were all right!”

Aglaya suddenly burst out laughing, as simply as a child."
"“Do you know why I have just told you these lies?” She appealed to the
prince, of a sudden, with the most childlike candour, and with the
laugh still trembling on her lips."
"“Because when one tells a lie, if one
insists on something unusual and eccentric--something too ‘out of the
way’ for anything, you know--the more impossible the thing is, the more
plausible does the lie sound."
I’ve noticed this.
"But I managed it badly;
I didn’t know how to work it.” She suddenly frowned again at this point
as though at some sudden unpleasant recollection."
"“If”--she began, looking seriously and even sadly at him--“if when I
read you all that about the ‘poor knight,’ I wished to-to praise you
for one thing--I also wished to show you that I knew all--and did not
approve of your conduct.”

“You are very unfair to me, and to that unfortunate woman of whom you
spoke just now in such dreadful terms, Aglaya.”

“Because I know all, all--and that is why I speak so."
"I know very well
how you--half a year since--offered her your hand before everybody."
Don’t interrupt me.
"You see, I am merely stating facts without any
comment upon them."
After that she ran away with Rogojin.
"Then you lived
with her at some village or town, and she ran away from you.” (Aglaya
blushed dreadfully.)"
"“Then she returned to Rogojin again, who loves
her like a madman."
"Then you--like a wise man as you are--came back here
after her as soon as ever you heard that she had returned to Petersburg."
"Yesterday evening you sprang forward to protect her, and just now you
dreamed about her."
"You see, I know all."
"You did come back here for her,
for her--now didn’t you?”

“Yes--for her!” said the prince softly and sadly, and bending his head
down, quite unconscious of the fact that Aglaya was gazing at him with
eyes which burned like live coals."
"“I came to find out something--I
don’t believe in her future happiness as Rogojin’s wife, although--in a
word, I did not know how to help her or what to do for her--but I came,
on the chance.”

He glanced at Aglaya, who was listening with a look of hatred on her
face."
"“If you came without knowing why, I suppose you love her very much
indeed!” she said at last."
"“No,” said the prince, “no, I do not love her."
Oh!
"if you only knew with
what horror I recall the time I spent with her!”

A shudder seemed to sweep over his whole body at the recollection."
"“Tell me about it,” said Aglaya."
“There is nothing which you might not hear.
"Why I should wish to tell
you, and only you, this experience of mine, I really cannot say;
perhaps it really is because I love you very much."
"This unhappy woman is
persuaded that she is the most hopeless, fallen creature in the world."
"Oh, do not condemn her!"
Do not cast stones at her!
"She has suffered too
much already in the consciousness of her own undeserved shame."
"“And she is not guilty--oh God!--Every moment she bemoans and bewails
herself, and cries out that she does not admit any guilt, that she is
the victim of circumstances--the victim of a wicked libertine."
"“But whatever she may say, remember that she does not believe it
herself,--remember that she will believe nothing but that she is a
guilty creature."
"“When I tried to rid her soul of this gloomy fallacy, she suffered so
terribly that my heart will never be quite at peace so long as I can
remember that dreadful time!--Do you know why she left me?"
"Simply to
prove to me what is not true--that she is base."
"But the worst of it is,
she did not realize herself that that was all she wanted to prove by
her departure!"
"She went away in response to some inner prompting to
do something disgraceful, in order that she might say to
herself--‘There--you’ve done a new act of shame--you degraded creature!’

“Oh, Aglaya--perhaps you cannot understand all this."
"Try to realize that
in the perpetual admission of guilt she probably finds some dreadful
unnatural satisfaction--as though she were revenging herself upon
someone."
"“Now and then I was able to persuade her almost to see light around
her again; but she would soon fall, once more, into her old tormenting
delusions, and would go so far as to reproach me for placing myself on a
pedestal above her (I never had an idea of such a thing!"
"), and informed
me, in reply to my proposal of marriage, that she ‘did not want
condescending sympathy or help from anybody.’ You saw her last night."
"You don’t suppose she can be happy among such people as those--you
cannot suppose that such society is fit for her?"
"You have no idea how
well-educated she is, and what an intellect she has!"
"She astonished me
sometimes.”

“And you preached her sermons there, did you?”

“Oh no,” continued the prince thoughtfully, not noticing Aglaya’s
mocking tone, “I was almost always silent there."
"I often wished to
speak, but I really did not know what to say."
"In some cases it is best
to say nothing, I think."
"I loved her, yes, I loved her very much indeed;
but afterwards--afterwards she guessed all.”

“What did she guess?”

“That I only _pitied_ her--and--and loved her no longer!”

“How do you know that?"
"How do you know that she is not really in love
with that--that rich cad--the man she eloped with?”

“Oh no!"
"I know she only laughs at him; she has made a fool of him all
along.”

“Has she never laughed at you?”

“No--in anger, perhaps."
Oh yes!
"she reproached me dreadfully in anger;
and suffered herself, too!"
But afterwards--oh!
"don’t remind me--don’t
remind me of that!”

He hid his face in his hands."
"“Are you aware that she writes to me almost every day?”

“So that is true, is it?” cried the prince, greatly agitated."
"“I had
heard a report of it, but would not believe it.”

“Whom did you hear it from?” asked Aglaya, alarmed."
"“Rogojin said
something about it yesterday, but nothing definite.”

“Yesterday!"
Morning or evening?
"Before the music or after?”

“After--it was about twelve o’clock.”

“Ah!"
"Well, if it was Rogojin--but do you know what she writes to me
about?”

“I should not be surprised by anything."
"She is mad!”

“There are the letters.” (Aglaya took three letters out of her pocket
and threw them down before the prince.)"
"“For a whole week she has been
entreating and worrying and persuading me to marry you."
"She--well, she
is clever, though she may be mad--much cleverer than I am, as you say."
"Well, she writes that she is in love with me herself, and tries to see
me every day, if only from a distance."
"She writes that you love me,
and that she has long known it and seen it, and that you and she talked
about me--there."
"She wishes to see you happy, and she says that she is
certain only I can ensure you the happiness you deserve."
"She writes such
strange, wild letters--I haven’t shown them to anyone."
"Now, do you know
what all this means?"
"Can you guess anything?”

“It is madness--it is merely another proof of her insanity!” said the
prince, and his lips trembled."
"“You are crying, aren’t you?”

“No, Aglaya."
"No, I’m not crying.” The prince looked at her."
"“Well, what am I to do?"
What do you advise me?
"I cannot go on receiving
these letters, you know.”

“Oh, let her alone, I entreat you!” cried the prince."
"“What can you do in
this dark, gloomy mystery?"
"Let her alone, and I’ll use all my power to
prevent her writing you any more letters.”

“If so, you are a heartless man!” cried Aglaya."
"“As if you can’t see that
it is not myself she loves, but you, you, and only you!"
"Surely you have
not remarked everything else in her, and only not _this?_ Do you know what
these letters mean?"
"They mean jealousy, sir--nothing but pure jealousy!"
"She--do you think she will ever really marry this Rogojin, as she says
here she will?"
"She would take her own life the day after you and I were
married.”

The prince shuddered; his heart seemed to freeze within him."
"He gazed
at Aglaya in wonderment; it was difficult for him to realize that this
child was also a woman."
"“God knows, Aglaya, that to restore her peace of mind and make her happy
I would willingly give up my life."
"But I cannot love her, and she knows
that.”

“Oh, make a sacrifice of yourself!"
"That sort of thing becomes you well,
you know."
Why not do it?
"And don’t call me ‘Aglaya’; you have done it
several times lately."
"You are bound, it is your _duty_ to ‘raise’ her; you
must go off somewhere again to soothe and pacify her."
"Why, you love her,
you know!”

“I cannot sacrifice myself so, though I admit I did wish to do so once."
"Who knows, perhaps I still wish to!"
"But I know for _certain_, that if she
married me it would be her ruin; I know this and therefore I leave her
alone."
I ought to go to see her today; now I shall probably not go.
"She
is proud, she would never forgive me the nature of the love I bear her,
and we should both be ruined."
"This may be unnatural, I don’t know; but
everything seems unnatural."
"You say she loves me, as if this were _love!_
As if she could love _me_, after what I have been through!"
"No, no, it is
not love.”

“How pale you have grown!” cried Aglaya in alarm."
"“Oh, it’s nothing."
"I haven’t slept, that’s all, and I’m rather tired."
"I--we certainly did talk about you, Aglaya.”

“Oh, indeed, it is true then!"
"_You could actually talk about me with her_;
and--and how could you have been fond of me when you had only seen me
once?”

“I don’t know."
"Perhaps it was that I seemed to come upon light in the
midst of my gloom."
"I told you the truth when I said I did not know why I
thought of you before all others."
"Of course it was all a sort of dream,
a dream amidst the horrors of reality."
Afterwards I began to work.
"I did
not intend to come back here for two or three years--”

“Then you came for her sake?” Aglaya’s voice trembled."
"“Yes, I came for her sake.”

There was a moment or two of gloomy silence."
Aglaya rose from her seat.
"“If you say,” she began in shaky tones, “if you say that this woman
of yours is mad--at all events I have nothing to do with her insane
fancies."
"Kindly take these three letters, Lef Nicolaievitch, and throw
them back to her, from me."
"And if she dares,” cried Aglaya suddenly,
much louder than before, “if she dares so much as write me one word
again, tell her I shall tell my father, and that she shall be taken to a
lunatic asylum.”

The prince jumped up in alarm at Aglaya’s sudden wrath, and a mist
seemed to come before his eyes."
“You cannot really feel like that!
You don’t mean what you say.
"It is
not true,” he murmured."
"“It _is_ true, it _is_ true,” cried Aglaya, almost beside herself
with rage."
“What’s true?
What’s all this?
"What’s true?” said an alarmed voice just
beside them."
Before them stood Lizabetha Prokofievna.
"“Why, it’s true that I am going to marry Gavrila Ardalionovitch, that I
love him and intend to elope with him tomorrow,” cried Aglaya, turning
upon her mother."
“Do you hear?
Is your curiosity satisfied?
"Are you
pleased with what you have heard?”

Aglaya rushed away homewards with these words."
“H’m!
"well, _you_ are not going away just yet, my friend, at all events,”
 said Lizabetha, stopping the prince."
"“Kindly step home with me, and let
me have a little explanation of the mystery."
"Nice goings on, these!"
"I
haven’t slept a wink all night as it is.”

The prince followed her."
IX.
"Arrived at her house, Lizabetha Prokofievna paused in the first room."
"She could go no farther, and subsided on to a couch quite exhausted; too
feeble to remember so much as to ask the prince to take a seat."
"This was
a large reception-room, full of flowers, and with a glass door leading
into the garden."
"Alexandra and Adelaida came in almost immediately, and looked
inquiringly at the prince and their mother."
"The girls generally rose at about nine in the morning in the country;
Aglaya, of late, had been in the habit of getting up rather earlier and
having a walk in the garden, but not at seven o’clock; about eight or a
little later was her usual time."
"Lizabetha Prokofievna, who really had not slept all night, rose at about
eight on purpose to meet Aglaya in the garden and walk with her; but she
could not find her either in the garden or in her own room."
"This agitated the old lady considerably; and she awoke her other
daughters."
"Next, she learned from the maid that Aglaya had gone into
the park before seven o’clock."
"The sisters made a joke of Aglaya’s last
freak, and told their mother that if she went into the park to look
for her, Aglaya would probably be very angry with her, and that she was
pretty sure to be sitting reading on the green bench that she had talked
of two or three days since, and about which she had nearly quarrelled
with Prince S., who did not see anything particularly lovely in it."
"Arrived at the rendezvous of the prince and her daughter, and hearing
the strange words of the latter, Lizabetha Prokofievna had been
dreadfully alarmed, for many reasons."
"However, now that she had dragged
the prince home with her, she began to feel a little frightened at what
she had undertaken."
"Why should not Aglaya meet the prince in the
park and have a talk with him, even if such a meeting should be by
appointment?"
"“Don’t suppose, prince,” she began, bracing herself up for the effort,
“don’t suppose that I have brought you here to ask questions."
"After last
night, I assure you, I am not so exceedingly anxious to see you at all;
I could have postponed the pleasure for a long while.” She paused."
"“But at the same time you would be very glad to know how I happened to
meet Aglaya Ivanovna this morning?” The prince finished her speech for
her with the utmost composure."
"“Well, what then?"
"Supposing I should like to know?” cried Lizabetha
Prokofievna, blushing."
“I’m sure I am not afraid of plain speaking.
"I’m
not offending anyone, and I never wish to, and--”

“Pardon me, it is no offence to wish to know this; you are her
mother."
"We met at the green bench this morning, punctually at seven
o’clock,--according to an agreement made by Aglaya Ivanovna with myself
yesterday."
"She said that she wished to see me and speak to me about
something important."
"We met and conversed for an hour about matters
concerning Aglaya Ivanovna herself, and that’s all.”

“Of course it is all, my friend."
"I don’t doubt you for a moment,” said
Lizabetha Prokofievna with dignity."
"“Well done, prince, capital!” cried Aglaya, who entered the room at
this moment."
"“Thank you for assuming that I would not demean myself
with lies."
"Come, is that enough, mamma, or do you intend to put any more
questions?”

“You know I have never needed to blush before you, up to this day,
though perhaps you would have been glad enough to make me,” said
Lizabetha Prokofievna,--with majesty."
"“Good-bye, prince; forgive me for
bothering you."
"I trust you will rest assured of my unalterable esteem
for you.”

The prince made his bows and retired at once."
"Alexandra and Adelaida
smiled and whispered to each other, while Lizabetha Prokofievna glared
severely at them."
"“We are only laughing at the prince’s beautiful bows,
mamma,” said Adelaida."
"“Sometimes he bows just like a meal-sack, but
to-day he was like--like Evgenie Pavlovitch!”

“It is the _heart_ which is the best teacher of refinement and dignity,
not the dancing-master,” said her mother, sententiously, and departed
upstairs to her own room, not so much as glancing at Aglaya."
"When the prince reached home, about nine o’clock, he found Vera Lebedeff
and the maid on the verandah."
"They were both busy trying to tidy up the
place after last night’s disorderly party."
"“Thank goodness, we’ve just managed to finish it before you came in!”
 said Vera, joyfully."
“Good-morning!
My head whirls so; I didn’t sleep all night.
"I should
like to have a nap now.”

“Here, on the verandah?"
"Very well, I’ll tell them all not to come and
wake you."
"Papa has gone out somewhere.”

The servant left the room."
"Vera was about to follow her, but returned
and approached the prince with a preoccupied air."
"“Prince!” she said, “have pity on that poor boy; don’t turn him out
today.”

“Not for the world; he shall do just as he likes.”

“He won’t do any harm now; and--and don’t be too severe with him.”

“Oh dear no!"
"Why--”

“And--and you won’t _laugh_ at him?"
"That’s the chief thing.”

“Oh no!"
"Never.”

“How foolish I am to speak of such things to a man like you,” said Vera,
blushing."
"“Though you _do_ look tired,” she added, half turning away,
“your eyes are so splendid at this moment--so full of happiness.”

“Really?” asked the prince, gleefully, and he laughed in delight."
"But Vera, simple-minded little girl that she was (just like a boy, in
fact), here became dreadfully confused, of a sudden, and ran hastily out
of the room, laughing and blushing."
"“What a dear little thing she is,” thought the prince, and immediately
forgot all about her."
"He walked to the far end of the verandah, where the sofa stood, with
a table in front of it."
"Here he sat down and covered his face with his
hands, and so remained for ten minutes."
"Suddenly he put his hand in his
coat-pocket and hurriedly produced three letters."
"But the door opened again, and out came Colia."
"The prince actually felt glad that he had been interrupted,--and might
return the letters to his pocket."
He was glad of the respite.
"“Well,” said Colia, plunging in medias res, as he always did, “here’s
a go!"
What do you think of Hippolyte now?
"Don’t respect him any longer,
eh?”

“Why not?"
"But look here, Colia, I’m tired; besides, the subject is too
melancholy to begin upon again."
"How is he, though?”

“Asleep--he’ll sleep for a couple of hours yet."
"I quite
understand--you haven’t slept--you walked about the park, I know."
"Agitation--excitement--all that sort of thing--quite natural, too!”

“How do you know I walked in the park and didn’t sleep at home?”

“Vera just told me."
"She tried to persuade me not to come, but I couldn’t
help myself, just for one minute."
"I have been having my turn at the
bedside for the last two hours; Kostia Lebedeff is there now."
"Burdovsky
has gone."
"Now, lie down, prince, make yourself comfortable, and sleep
well!"
"I’m awfully impressed, you know.”

“Naturally, all this--”

“No, no, I mean with the ‘explanation,’ especially that part of it where
he talks about Providence and a future life."
"There is a gigantic thought
there.”

The prince gazed affectionately at Colia, who, of course, had come in
solely for the purpose of talking about this “gigantic thought.”

“But it is not any one particular thought, only; it is the general
circumstances of the case."
"If Voltaire had written this now, or
Rousseau, I should have just read it and thought it remarkable, but
should not have been so _impressed_ by it."
"But a man who knows for
certain that he has but ten minutes to live and can talk like
that--why--it’s--it’s _pride_, that is!"
"It is really a most extraordinary,
exalted assertion of personal dignity, it’s--it’s _defiant!_ What a
_gigantic_ strength of will, eh?"
"And to accuse a fellow like that of not
putting in the cap on purpose; it’s base and mean!"
"You know he deceived
us last night, the cunning rascal."
"I never packed his bag for him, and
I never saw his pistol."
He packed it himself.
"But he put me off my guard
like that, you see."
"Vera says you are going to let him stay on; I swear
there’s no danger, especially as we are always with him.”

“Who was by him at night?”

“I, and Burdovsky, and Kostia Lebedeff."
"Keller stayed a little while,
and then went over to Lebedeff’s to sleep."
"Ferdishenko slept at
Lebedeff’s, too; but he went away at seven o’clock."
"My father is always
at Lebedeff’s; but he has gone out just now."
"I dare say Lebedeff will be
coming in here directly; he has been looking for you; I don’t know what
he wants."
"Shall we let him in or not, if you are asleep?"
"I’m going to
have a nap, too."
"By-the-by, such a curious thing happened."
"Burdovsky
woke me at seven, and I met my father just outside the room, so drunk,
he didn’t even know me."
"He stood before me like a log, and when he
recovered himself, asked hurriedly how Hippolyte was."
"‘Yes,’ he said,
when I told him, ‘that’s all very well, but I _really_ came to warn you
that you must be very careful what you say before Ferdishenko.’ Do you
follow me, prince?”

“Yes."
Is it really so?
"However, it’s all the same to us, of course.”

“Of course it is; we are not a secret society; and that being the case,
it is all the more curious that the general should have been on his way
to wake me up in order to tell me this.”

“Ferdishenko has gone, you say?”

“Yes, he went at seven o’clock."
"He came into the room on his way out; I
was watching just then."
"He said he was going to spend ‘the rest of the
night’ at Wilkin’s; there’s a tipsy fellow, a friend of his, of that
name."
"Well, I’m off."
"Oh, here’s Lebedeff himself!"
"The prince wants to go
to sleep, Lukian Timofeyovitch, so you may just go away again.”

“One moment, my dear prince, just one."
"I must absolutely speak to you
about something which is most grave,” said Lebedeff, mysteriously and
solemnly, entering the room with a bow and looking extremely important."
"He had but just returned, and carried his hat in his hand."
"He looked
preoccupied and most unusually dignified."
The prince begged him to take a chair.
"“I hear you have called twice; I suppose you are still worried about
yesterday’s affair.”

“What, about that boy, you mean?"
"Oh dear no, yesterday my ideas were
a little--well--mixed."
"Today, I assure you, I shall not oppose in the
slightest degree any suggestions it may please you to make.”

“What’s up with you this morning, Lebedeff?"
"You look so important and
dignified, and you choose your words so carefully,” said the prince,
smiling."
"“Nicolai Ardalionovitch!” said Lebedeff, in a most amiable tone of
voice, addressing the boy."
"“As I have a communication to make to the
prince which concerns only myself--”

“Of course, of course, not my affair."
"All right,” said Colia, and away
he went."
"“I love that boy for his perception,” said Lebedeff, looking after
him."
"“My dear prince,” he continued, “I have had a terrible misfortune,
either last night or early this morning."
"I cannot tell the exact time.”

“What is it?”

“I have lost four hundred roubles out of my side pocket!"
"They’re gone!”
 said Lebedeff, with a sour smile."
“You’ve lost four hundred roubles?
Oh!
"I’m sorry for that.”

“Yes, it is serious for a poor man who lives by his toil.”

“Of course, of course!"
"How was it?”

“Oh, the wine is to blame, of course."
"I confess to you, prince, as I
would to Providence itself."
"Yesterday I received four hundred roubles
from a debtor at about five in the afternoon, and came down here by
train."
I had my purse in my pocket.
"When I changed, I put the money
into the pocket of my plain clothes, intending to keep it by me, as I
expected to have an applicant for it in the evening.”

“It’s true then, Lebedeff, that you advertise to lend money on gold or
silver articles?”

“Yes, through an agent."
My own name doesn’t appear.
"I have a large
family, you see, and at a small percentage--”

“Quite so, quite so."
I only asked for information--excuse the question.
"Go on.”

“Well, meanwhile that sick boy was brought here, and those guests came
in, and we had tea, and--well, we made merry--to my ruin!"
"Hearing of
your birthday afterwards, and excited with the circumstances of the
evening, I ran upstairs and changed my plain clothes once more for my
uniform [Civil Service clerks in Russia wear uniform.]"
"--you must have
noticed I had my uniform on all the evening?"
"Well, I forgot the money in
the pocket of my old coat--you know when God will ruin a man he first
of all bereaves him of his senses--and it was only this morning at
half-past seven that I woke up and grabbed at my coat pocket, first
thing."
"The pocket was empty--the purse gone, and not a trace to be
found!”

“Dear me!"
"This is very unpleasant!”

“Unpleasant!"
Indeed it is.
"You have found a very appropriate
expression,” said Lebedeff, politely, but with sarcasm."
“But what’s to be done?
"It’s a serious matter,” said the prince,
thoughtfully."
"“Don’t you think you may have dropped it out of your
pocket whilst intoxicated?”

“Certainly."
"Anything is possible when one is intoxicated, as you neatly
express it, prince."
"But consider--if I, intoxicated or not, dropped an
object out of my pocket on to the ground, that object ought to remain on
the ground."
"Where is the object, then?”

“Didn’t you put it away in some drawer, perhaps?”

“I’ve looked everywhere, and turned out everything.”

“I confess this disturbs me a good deal."
"Someone must have picked it up,
then.”

“Or taken it out of my pocket--two alternatives.”

“It is very distressing, because _who_--?"
"That’s the question!”

“Most undoubtedly, excellent prince, you have hit it--that is the very
question."
"How wonderfully you express the exact situation in a few
words!”

“Come, come, Lebedeff, no sarcasm!"
"It’s a serious--”

“Sarcasm!” cried Lebedeff, wringing his hands."
"“All right, all right,
I’m not angry."
I’m only put out about this.
"Whom do you suspect?”

“That is a very difficult and complicated question."
"I cannot suspect the
servant, for she was in the kitchen the whole evening, nor do I suspect
any of my children.”

“I should think not."
"Go on.”

“Then it must be one of the guests.”

“Is such a thing possible?”

“Absolutely and utterly impossible--and yet, so it must be."
"But one
thing I am sure of, if it be a theft, it was committed, not in the
evening when we were all together, but either at night or early in the
morning; therefore, by one of those who slept here."
"Burdovsky and Colia
I except, of course."
"They did not even come into my room.”

“Yes, or even if they had!"
"But who did sleep with you?”

“Four of us, including myself, in two rooms."
"The general, myself,
Keller, and Ferdishenko."
One of us four it must have been.
"I don’t
suspect myself, though such cases have been known.”

“Oh!"
"_do_ go on, Lebedeff!"
"Don’t drag it out so.”

“Well, there are three left, then--Keller firstly."
"He is a drunkard
to begin with, and a liberal (in the sense of other people’s pockets),
otherwise with more of the ancient knight about him than of the modern
liberal."
"He was with the sick man at first, but came over afterwards
because there was no place to lie down in the room and the floor was so
hard.”

“You suspect him?”

“I _did_ suspect him."
"When I woke up at half-past seven and tore my hair
in despair for my loss and carelessness, I awoke the general, who was
sleeping the sleep of innocence near me."
"Taking into consideration the
sudden disappearance of Ferdishenko, which was suspicious in itself, we
decided to search Keller, who was lying there sleeping like a top."
"Well,
we searched his clothes thoroughly, and not a farthing did we find; in
fact, his pockets all had holes in them."
"We found a dirty handkerchief,
and a love-letter from some scullery-maid."
"The general decided that he
was innocent."
"We awoke him for further inquiries, and had the greatest
difficulty in making him understand what was up."
"He opened his mouth and
stared--he looked so stupid and so absurdly innocent."
"It wasn’t Keller.”

“Oh, I’m so glad!” said the prince, joyfully."
"“I was so afraid.”

“Afraid!"
"Then you had some grounds for supposing he might be the
culprit?” said Lebedeff, frowning."
“Oh no--not a bit!
It was foolish of me to say I was afraid!
"Don’t
repeat it please, Lebedeff, don’t tell anyone I said that!”

“My dear prince!"
"your words lie in the lowest depth of my heart--it is
their tomb!” said Lebedeff, solemnly, pressing his hat to the region of
his heart."
“Thanks; very well.
"Then I suppose it’s Ferdishenko; that is, I mean,
you suspect Ferdishenko?”

“Whom else?” said Lebedeff, softly, gazing intently into the prince s
face."
"“Of course--quite so, whom else?"
"But what are the proofs?”

“We have evidence."
"In the first place, his mysterious disappearance at
seven o’clock, or even earlier.”

“I know, Colia told me that he had said he was off to--I forget the
name, some friend of his, to finish the night.”

“H’m!"
"then Colia has spoken to you already?”

“Not about the theft.”

“He does not know of it; I have kept it a secret."
"Very well, Ferdishenko
went off to Wilkin’s."
"That is not so curious in itself, but here the
evidence opens out further."
"He left his address, you see, when he went."
"Now prince, consider, why did he leave his address?"
"Why do you suppose
he went out of his way to tell Colia that he had gone to Wilkin’s?"
"Who
cared to know that he was going to Wilkin’s?"
"No, no!"
"prince, this is
finesse, thieves’ finesse!"
"This is as good as saying, ‘There, how can I
be a thief when I leave my address?"
"I’m not concealing my movements as a
thief would.’ Do you understand, prince?”

“Oh yes, but that is not enough.”

“Second proof."
"The scent turns out to be false, and the address given
is a sham."
"An hour after--that is at about eight, I went to Wilkin’s
myself, and there was no trace of Ferdishenko."
"The maid did tell me,
certainly, that an hour or so since someone had been hammering at the
door, and had smashed the bell; she said she would not open the door
because she didn’t want to wake her master; probably she was too lazy to
get up herself."
"Such phenomena are met with occasionally!”

“But is that all your evidence?"
"It is not enough!”

“Well, prince, whom are we to suspect, then?"
"Consider!” said Lebedeff
with almost servile amiability, smiling at the prince."
"There was a look
of cunning in his eyes, however."
"“You should search your room and all the cupboards again,” said the
prince, after a moment or two of silent reflection."
"“But I have done so, my dear prince!” said Lebedeff, more sweetly than
ever."
“H’m!
"why must you needs go up and change your coat like that?” asked
the prince, banging the table with his fist, in annoyance."
"“Oh, don’t be so worried on my account, prince!"
"I assure you I am not
worth it!"
"At least, not I alone."
"But I see you are suffering on behalf
of the criminal too, for wretched Ferdishenko, in fact!”

“Of course you have given me a disagreeable enough thing to think
about,” said the prince, irritably, “but what are you going to do, since
you are so sure it was Ferdishenko?”

“But who else _could_ it be, my very dear prince?” repeated Lebedeff, as
sweet as sugar again."
"“If you don’t wish me to suspect Mr. Burdovsky?”

“Of course not.”

“Nor the general?"
"Ha, ha, ha!”

“Nonsense!” said the prince, angrily, turning round upon him."
"“Quite so, nonsense!"
"Ha, ha, ha!"
dear me!
"He did amuse me, did the
general!"
"We went off on the hot scent to Wilkin’s together, you know;
but I must first observe that the general was even more thunderstruck
than I myself this morning, when I awoke him after discovering the
theft; so much so that his very face changed--he grew red and then pale,
and at length flew into a paroxysm of such noble wrath that I assure you
I was quite surprised!"
He is a most generous-hearted man!
"He tells lies
by the thousands, I know, but it is merely a weakness; he is a man of
the highest feelings; a simple-minded man too, and a man who carries the
conviction of innocence in his very appearance."
"I love that man, sir; I
may have told you so before; it is a weakness of mine."
"Well--he suddenly
stopped in the middle of the road, opened out his coat and bared his
breast."
"‘Search me,’ he says, ‘you searched Keller; why don’t you search
me too?"
It is only fair!’ says he.
"And all the while his legs and hands
were trembling with anger, and he as white as a sheet all over!"
"So I
said to him, ‘Nonsense, general; if anybody but yourself had said that
to me, I’d have taken my head, my own head, and put it on a large dish
and carried it round to anyone who suspected you; and I should have
said: “There, you see that head?"
"It’s my head, and I’ll go bail with
that head for him!"
"Yes, and walk through the fire for him, too.” There,’
says I, ‘that’s how I’d answer for you, general!’ Then he embraced me,
in the middle of the street, and hugged me so tight (crying over me all
the while) that I coughed fit to choke!"
"‘You are the one friend left to
me amid all my misfortunes,’ says he."
"Oh, he’s a man of sentiment, that!"
"He went on to tell me a story of how he had been accused, or suspected,
of stealing five hundred thousand roubles once, as a young man; and how,
the very next day, he had rushed into a burning, blazing house and saved
the very count who suspected him, and Nina Alexandrovna (who was then
a young girl), from a fiery death."
"The count embraced him, and that was
how he came to marry Nina Alexandrovna, he said."
"As for the money, it
was found among the ruins next day in an English iron box with a secret
lock; it had got under the floor somehow, and if it had not been for the
fire it would never have been found!"
"The whole thing is, of course, an
absolute fabrication, though when he spoke of Nina Alexandrovna he wept!"
"She’s a grand woman, is Nina Alexandrovna, though she is very angry with
me!”

“Are you acquainted with her?”

“Well, hardly at all."
"I wish I were, if only for the sake of justifying
myself in her eyes."
"Nina Alexandrovna has a grudge against me for, as
she thinks, encouraging her husband in drinking; whereas in reality I
not only do not encourage him, but I actually keep him out of harm’s
way, and out of bad company."
"Besides, he’s my friend, prince, so that
I shall not lose sight of him, again."
"Where he goes, I go."
"He’s quite
given up visiting the captain’s widow, though sometimes he thinks sadly
of her, especially in the morning, when he’s putting on his boots."
"I
don’t know why it’s at that time."
"But he has no money, and it’s no
use his going to see her without."
"Has he borrowed any money from you,
prince?”

“No, he has not.”

“Ah, he’s ashamed to!"
"He _meant_ to ask you, I know, for he said so."
"I
suppose he thinks that as you gave him some once (you remember), you
would probably refuse if he asked you again.”

“Do you ever give him money?”

“Prince!"
Money!
"Why I would give that man not only my money, but my
very life, if he wanted it."
"Well, perhaps that’s exaggeration; not life,
we’ll say, but some illness, a boil or a bad cough, or anything of that
sort, I would stand with pleasure, for his sake; for I consider him a
great man fallen--money, indeed!”

“H’m, then you _do_ give him money?”

“N-no, I have never given him money, and he knows well that I will never
give him any; because I am anxious to keep him out of intemperate
ways."
"He is going to town with me now; for you must know I am off to
Petersburg after Ferdishenko, while the scent is hot; I’m certain he is
there."
"I shall let the general go one way, while I go the other; we have
so arranged matters in order to pop out upon Ferdishenko, you see, from
different sides."
"But I am going to follow that naughty old general and
catch him, I know where, at a certain widow’s house; for I think it will
be a good lesson, to put him to shame by catching him with the widow.”

“Oh, Lebedeff, don’t, don’t make any scandal about it!” said the prince,
much agitated, and speaking in a low voice."
"“Not for the world, not for the world!"
"I merely wish to make him ashamed
of himself."
"Oh, prince, great though this misfortune be to myself, I
cannot help thinking of his morals!"
"I have a great favour to ask of you,
esteemed prince; I confess that it is the chief object of my visit."
"You
know the Ivolgins, you have even lived in their house; so if you would
lend me your help, honoured prince, in the general’s own interest and
for his good.”

Lebedeff clasped his hands in supplication."
“What help do you want from me?
"You may be certain that I am most
anxious to understand you, Lebedeff.”

“I felt sure of that, or I should not have come to you."
"We might manage
it with the help of Nina Alexandrovna, so that he might be closely
watched in his own house."
"Unfortunately I am not on terms...
otherwise... but Nicolai Ardalionovitch, who adores you with all his
youthful soul, might help, too.”

“No, no!"
"Heaven forbid that we should bring Nina Alexandrovna into this
business!"
"Or Colia, either."
"But perhaps I have not yet quite understood
you, Lebedeff?”

Lebedeff made an impatient movement."
“But there is nothing to understand!
"Sympathy and tenderness, that
is all--that is all our poor invalid requires!"
"You will permit me to
consider him an invalid?”

“Yes, it shows delicacy and intelligence on your part.”

“I will explain my idea by a practical example, to make it clearer."
"You
know the sort of man he is."
"At present his only failing is that he is
crazy about that captain’s widow, and he cannot go to her without
money, and I mean to catch him at her house today--for his own good; but
supposing it was not only the widow, but that he had committed a real
crime, or at least some very dishonourable action (of which he is, of
course, incapable), I repeat that even in that case, if he were treated
with what I may call generous tenderness, one could get at the whole
truth, for he is very soft-hearted!"
"Believe me, he would betray himself
before five days were out; he would burst into tears, and make a clean
breast of the matter; especially if managed with tact, and if you and
his family watched his every step, so to speak."
"Oh, my dear prince,”
 Lebedeff added most emphatically, “I do not positively assert that he
has..."
"I am ready, as the saying is, to shed my last drop of blood for
him this instant; but you will admit that debauchery, drunkenness, and
the captain’s widow, all these together may lead him very far.”

“I am, of course, quite ready to add my efforts to yours in such a
case,” said the prince, rising; “but I confess, Lebedeff, that I am
terribly perplexed."
"Tell me, do you still think... plainly, you say
yourself that you suspect Mr. Ferdishenko?”

Lebedeff clasped his hands once more."
"“Why, who else could I possibly suspect?"
"Who else, most outspoken
prince?” he replied, with an unctuous smile."
"Muishkin frowned, and rose from his seat."
"“You see, Lebedeff, a mistake here would be a dreadful thing."
"This
Ferdishenko, I would not say a word against him, of course; but, who
knows?"
Perhaps it really was he?
"I mean he really does seem to be a more
likely man than... than any other.”

Lebedeff strained his eyes and ears to take in what the prince was
saying."
"The latter was frowning more and more, and walking excitedly up
and down, trying not to look at Lebedeff."
"“You see,” he said, “I was given to understand that Ferdishenko was that
sort of man,--that one can’t say everything before him."
"One has to take
care not to say too much, you understand?"
"I say this to prove that he
really is, so to speak, more likely to have done this than anyone else,
eh?"
You understand?
"The important thing is, not to make a mistake.”

“And who told you this about Ferdishenko?”

“Oh, I was told."
Of course I don’t altogether believe it.
"I am very
sorry that I should have had to say this, because I assure you I don’t
believe it myself; it is all nonsense, of course."
"It was stupid of me to
say anything about it.”

“You see, it is very important, it is most important to know where you
got this report from,” said Lebedeff, excitedly."
"He had risen from his
seat, and was trying to keep step with the prince, running after him, up
and down."
"“Because look here, prince, I don’t mind telling you now that
as we were going along to Wilkin’s this morning, after telling me what
you know about the fire, and saving the count and all that, the general
was pleased to drop certain hints to the same effect about Ferdishenko,
but so vaguely and clumsily that I thought better to put a few questions
to him on the matter, with the result that I found the whole thing was
an invention of his excellency’s own mind."
"Of course, he only lies with
the best intentions; still, he lies."
"But, such being the case, where
could you have heard the same report?"
"It was the inspiration of the
moment with him, you understand, so who could have told _you?_ It is an
important question, you see!”

“It was Colia told me, and his father told _him_ at about six this
morning."
"They met at the threshold, when Colia was leaving the room for
something or other.” The prince told Lebedeff all that Colia had made
known to himself, in detail."
"“There now, that’s what we may call _scent!_” said Lebedeff, rubbing his
hands and laughing silently."
"“I thought it must be so, you see."
"The
general interrupted his innocent slumbers, at six o’clock, in order
to go and wake his beloved son, and warn him of the dreadful danger of
companionship with Ferdishenko."
Dear me!
"what a dreadfully dangerous man
Ferdishenko must be, and what touching paternal solicitude, on the part
of his excellency, ha!"
ha!
"ha!”

“Listen, Lebedeff,” began the prince, quite overwhelmed; “_do_ act
quietly--don’t make a scandal, Lebedeff, I ask you--I entreat you!"
"No
one must know--_no one_, mind!"
"In that case only, I will help you.”

“Be assured, most honourable, most worthy of princes--be assured that
the whole matter shall be buried within my heart!” cried Lebedeff, in a
paroxysm of exaltation."
"“I’d give every drop of my blood... Illustrious
prince, I am a poor wretch in soul and spirit, but ask the veriest
scoundrel whether he would prefer to deal with one like himself, or with
a noble-hearted man like you, and there is no doubt as to his choice!"
"He’ll answer that he prefers the noble-hearted man--and there you
have the triumph of virtue!"
"_Au revoir_, honoured prince!"
"You and I
together--softly!"
"softly!”

X."
"The prince understood at last why he shivered with dread every time
he thought of the three letters in his pocket, and why he had put off
reading them until the evening."
"When he fell into a heavy sleep on the sofa on the verandah, without
having had the courage to open a single one of the three envelopes, he
again dreamed a painful dream, and once more that poor, “sinful” woman
appeared to him."
"Again she gazed at him with tears sparkling on her long
lashes, and beckoned him after her; and again he awoke, as before, with
the picture of her face haunting him."
He longed to get up and go to her at once--but he _could not_.
"At length,
almost in despair, he unfolded the letters, and began to read them."
"These letters, too, were like a dream."
"We sometimes have strange,
impossible dreams, contrary to all the laws of nature."
"When we awake we
remember them and wonder at their strangeness."
"You remember, perhaps,
that you were in full possession of your reason during this succession
of fantastic images; even that you acted with extraordinary logic and
cunning while surrounded by murderers who hid their intentions and made
great demonstrations of friendship, while waiting for an opportunity
to cut your throat."
"You remember how you escaped them by some ingenious
stratagem; then you doubted if they were really deceived, or whether
they were only pretending not to know your hiding-place; then you
thought of another plan and hoodwinked them once again."
"You remember all
this quite clearly, but how is it that your reason calmly accepted all
the manifest absurdities and impossibilities that crowded into your
dream?"
"One of the murderers suddenly changed into a woman before your
very eyes; then the woman was transformed into a hideous, cunning little
dwarf; and you believed it, and accepted it all almost as a matter of
course--while at the same time your intelligence seemed unusually keen,
and accomplished miracles of cunning, sagacity, and logic!"
"Why is it
that when you awake to the world of realities you nearly always feel,
sometimes very vividly, that the vanished dream has carried with it some
enigma which you have failed to solve?"
"You smile at the extravagance
of your dream, and yet you feel that this tissue of absurdity contained
some real idea, something that belongs to your true life,--something
that exists, and has always existed, in your heart."
"You search your
dream for some prophecy that you were expecting."
"It has left a deep
impression upon you, joyful or cruel, but what it means, or what has
been predicted to you in it, you can neither understand nor remember."
The reading of these letters produced some such effect upon the prince.
"He felt, before he even opened the envelopes, that the very fact of
their existence was like a nightmare."
"How could she ever have made up
her mind to write to her?"
he asked himself.
"How could she write about
that at all?"
And how could such a wild idea have entered her head?
"And yet, the strangest part of the matter was, that while he read the
letters, he himself almost believed in the possibility, and even in the
justification, of the idea he had thought so wild."
"Of course it was a
mad dream, a nightmare, and yet there was something cruelly real about
it."
For hours he was haunted by what he had read.
"Several passages
returned again and again to his mind, and as he brooded over them, he
felt inclined to say to himself that he had foreseen and known all that
was written here; it even seemed to him that he had read the whole of
this some time or other, long, long ago; and all that had tormented and
grieved him up to now was to be found in these old, long since read,
letters."
"“When you open this letter” (so the first began), “look first at the
signature."
"The signature will tell you all, so that I need explain
nothing, nor attempt to justify myself."
"Were I in any way on a footing
with you, you might be offended at my audacity; but who am I, and who
are you?"
"We are at such extremes, and I am so far removed from you, that
I could not offend you if I wished to do so.”

Farther on, in another place, she wrote: “Do not consider my words
as the sickly ecstasies of a diseased mind, but you are, in my
opinion--perfection!"
I have seen you--I see you every day.
"I do not
judge you; I have not weighed you in the scales of Reason and found you
Perfection--it is simply an article of faith."
"But I must confess one sin
against you--I love you."
One should not love perfection.
"One should
only look on it as perfection--yet I am in love with you."
"Though love
equalizes, do not fear."
"I have not lowered you to my level, even in
my most secret thoughts."
"I have written ‘Do not fear,’ as if you could
fear."
"I would kiss your footprints if I could; but, oh!"
"I am not putting
myself on a level with you!--Look at the signature--quick, look at the
signature!”

“However, observe” (she wrote in another of the letters), “that although
I couple you with him, yet I have not once asked you whether you love
him."
"He fell in love with you, though he saw you but once."
"He spoke of
you as of ‘the light.’ These are his own words--I heard him use them."
"But I understood without his saying it that you were all that light is
to him."
"I lived near him for a whole month, and I understood then that
you, too, must love him."
"I think of you and him as one.”

“What was the matter yesterday?” (she wrote on another sheet)."
"“I passed
by you, and you seemed to me to _blush_."
Perhaps it was only my fancy.
"If I were to bring you to the most loathsome den, and show you the
revelation of undisguised vice--you should not blush."
"You can never feel
the sense of personal affront."
"You may hate all who are mean, or base,
or unworthy--but not for yourself--only for those whom they wrong."
"No
one can wrong _you_."
"Do you know, I think you ought to love me--for you
are the same in my eyes as in his--you are as light."
"An angel cannot
hate, perhaps cannot love, either."
"I often ask myself--is it possible to
love everybody?"
Indeed it is not; it is not in nature.
"Abstract love
of humanity is nearly always love of self."
But you are different.
"You
cannot help loving all, since you can compare with none, and are above
all personal offence or anger."
Oh!
"how bitter it would be to me to
know that you felt anger or shame on my account, for that would be your
fall--you would become comparable at once with such as me."
"“Yesterday, after seeing you, I went home and thought out a picture."
"“Artists always draw the Saviour as an actor in one of the Gospel
stories."
I should do differently.
"I should represent Christ alone--the
disciples did leave Him alone occasionally."
"I should paint one little
child left with Him."
"This child has been playing about near Him, and
had probably just been telling the Saviour something in its pretty
baby prattle."
"Christ had listened to it, but was now musing--one
hand reposing on the child’s bright head."
"His eyes have a far-away
expression."
"Thought, great as the Universe, is in them--His face is sad."
"The little one leans its elbow upon Christ’s knee, and with its cheek
resting on its hand, gazes up at Him, pondering as children sometimes do
ponder."
The sun is setting.
There you have my picture.
"“You are innocent--and in your innocence lies all your perfection--oh,
remember that!"
"What is my passion to you?--you are mine now; I shall be
near you all my life--I shall not live long!”

At length, in the last letter of all, he found:

“For Heaven’s sake, don’t misunderstand me!"
"Do not think that I
humiliate myself by writing thus to you, or that I belong to that class
of people who take a satisfaction in humiliating themselves--from pride."
"I have my consolation, though it would be difficult to explain it--but I
do not humiliate myself."
“Why do I wish to unite you two?
For your sakes or my own?
"For my own
sake, naturally."
"All the problems of my life would thus be solved;
I have thought so for a long time."
"I know that once when your sister
Adelaida saw my portrait she said that such beauty could overthrow
the world."
But I have renounced the world.
"You think it strange that
I should say so, for you saw me decked with lace and diamonds, in the
company of drunkards and wastrels."
"Take no notice of that; I know that
I have almost ceased to exist."
"God knows what it is dwelling within me
now--it is not myself."
"I can see it every day in two dreadful eyes which
are always looking at me, even when not present."
"These eyes are silent
now, they say nothing; but I know their secret."
"His house is gloomy, and
there is a secret in it."
"I am convinced that in some box he has a razor
hidden, tied round with silk, just like the one that Moscow murderer
had."
"This man also lived with his mother, and had a razor hidden away,
tied round with white silk, and with this razor he intended to cut a
throat."
"“All the while I was in their house I felt sure that somewhere beneath
the floor there was hidden away some dreadful corpse, wrapped in
oil-cloth, perhaps buried there by his father, who knows?"
"Just as in the
Moscow case."
I could have shown you the very spot!
"“He is always silent, but I know well that he loves me so much that he
must hate me."
"My wedding and yours are to be on the same day; so I have
arranged with him."
I have no secrets from him.
"I would kill him from
very fright, but he will kill me first."
"He has just burst out laughing,
and says that I am raving."
"He knows I am writing to you.”

There was much more of this delirious wandering in the letters--one of
them was very long."
"At last the prince came out of the dark, gloomy park, in which he had
wandered about for hours just as yesterday."
"The bright night seemed to
him to be lighter than ever."
"“It must be quite early,” he thought."
"(He
had forgotten his watch.)"
There was a sound of distant music somewhere.
"“Ah,” he thought, “the Vauxhall!"
"They won’t be there today, of course!”
 At this moment he noticed that he was close to their house; he had felt
that he must gravitate to this spot eventually, and, with a beating
heart, he mounted the verandah steps."
"No one met him; the verandah was empty, and nearly pitch dark."
"He opened
the door into the room, but it, too, was dark and empty."
"He stood in the
middle of the room in perplexity."
"Suddenly the door opened, and in came
Alexandra, candle in hand."
"Seeing the prince she stopped before him in
surprise, looking at him questioningly."
"It was clear that she had been merely passing through the room from door
to door, and had not had the remotest notion that she would meet anyone."
"“How did you come here?” she asked, at last."
"“I--I--came in--”

“Mamma is not very well, nor is Aglaya."
"Adelaida has gone to bed, and
I am just going."
We were alone the whole evening.
"Father and Prince S.
have gone to town.”

“I have come to you--now--to--”

“Do you know what time it is?”

“N--no!”

“Half-past twelve."
"We are always in bed by one.”

“I--I thought it was half-past nine!”

“Never mind!” she laughed, “but why didn’t you come earlier?"
"Perhaps you
were expected!”

“I thought” he stammered, making for the door."
"“_Au revoir!_ I shall amuse them all with this story tomorrow!”

He walked along the road towards his own house."
"His heart was beating,
his thoughts were confused, everything around seemed to be part of a
dream."
"And suddenly, just as twice already he had awaked from sleep with the
same vision, that very apparition now seemed to rise up before him."
"The
woman appeared to step out from the park, and stand in the path in front
of him, as though she had been waiting for him there."
He shuddered and stopped; she seized his hand and pressed it frenziedly.
"No, this was no apparition!"
"There she stood at last, face to face with him, for the first time since
their parting."
"She said something, but he looked silently back at her."
"His heart ached
with anguish."
Oh!
"never would he banish the recollection of this meeting
with her, and he never remembered it but with the same pain and agony of
mind."
"She went on her knees before him--there in the open road--like a
madwoman."
"He retreated a step, but she caught his hand and kissed
it, and, just as in his dream, the tears were sparkling on her long,
beautiful lashes."
"“Get up!” he said, in a frightened whisper, raising her."
"“Get up at
once!”

“Are you happy--are you happy?” she asked."
“Say this one word.
"Are you
happy now?"
"Today, this moment?"
Have you just been with her?
"What did she
say?”

She did not rise from her knees; she would not listen to him; she put
her questions hurriedly, as though she were pursued."
"“I am going away tomorrow, as you bade me--I won’t write--so that this
is the last time I shall see you, the last time!"
"This is really the _last
time!_”

“Oh, be calm--be calm!"
"Get up!” he entreated, in despair."
She gazed thirstily at him and clutched his hands.
"“Good-bye!” she said at last, and rose and left him, very quickly."
"The prince noticed that Rogojin had suddenly appeared at her side, and
had taken her arm and was leading her away."
"“Wait a minute, prince,” shouted the latter, as he went."
"“I shall be
back in five minutes.”

He reappeared in five minutes as he had said."
"The prince was waiting for
him."
"“I’ve put her in the carriage,” he said; “it has been waiting round the
corner there since ten o’clock."
"She expected that you would be with _them_
all the evening."
I told her exactly what you wrote me.
"She won’t write
to the girl any more, she promises; and tomorrow she will be off, as you
wish."
"She desired to see you for the last time, although you refused,
so we’ve been sitting and waiting on that bench till you should pass on
your way home.”

“Did she bring you with her of her own accord?”

“Of course she did!” said Rogojin, showing his teeth; “and I saw for
myself what I knew before."
"You’ve read her letters, I suppose?”

“Did you read them?” asked the prince, struck by the thought."
“Of course--she showed them to me herself.
"You are thinking of the
razor, eh?"
"Ha, ha, ha!”

“Oh, she is mad!” cried the prince, wringing his hands."
“Who knows?
"Perhaps she is not so mad after all,” said Rogojin, softly, as though
thinking aloud."
The prince made no reply.
"“Well, good-bye,” said Rogojin."
"“I’m off tomorrow too, you know."
Remember me kindly!
"By-the-by,” he added, turning round sharply again,
“did you answer her question just now?"
"Are you happy, or not?”

“No, no, no!” cried the prince, with unspeakable sadness."
"“Ha, ha!"
"I never supposed you would say ‘yes,’” cried Rogojin, laughing
sardonically."
"And he disappeared, without looking round again."
"PART IV

I."
"A week had elapsed since the rendezvous of our two friends on the
green bench in the park, when, one fine morning at about half-past ten
o’clock, Varvara Ardalionovna, otherwise Mrs. Ptitsin, who had been
out to visit a friend, returned home in a state of considerable mental
depression."
"There are certain people of whom it is difficult to say anything which
will at once throw them into relief--in other words, describe them
graphically in their typical characteristics."
"These are they who are
generally known as “commonplace people,” and this class comprises, of
course, the immense majority of mankind."
"Authors, as a rule, attempt to
select and portray types rarely met with in their entirety, but these
types are nevertheless more real than real life itself."
"“Podkoleosin” [A character in Gogol’s comedy, The Wedding.]"
"was perhaps
an exaggeration, but he was by no means a non-existent character; on the
contrary, how many intelligent people, after hearing of this Podkoleosin
from Gogol, immediately began to find that scores of their friends were
exactly like him!"
"They knew, perhaps, before Gogol told them, that their
friends were like Podkoleosin, but they did not know what name to give
them."
"In real life, young fellows seldom jump out of the window just
before their weddings, because such a feat, not to speak of its other
aspects, must be a decidedly unpleasant mode of escape; and yet there
are plenty of bridegrooms, intelligent fellows too, who would be ready
to confess themselves Podkoleosins in the depths of their consciousness,
just before marriage."
"Nor does every husband feel bound to repeat
at every step, “_Tu l’as voulu, Georges Dandin!_” like another typical
personage; and yet how many millions and billions of Georges Dandins
there are in real life who feel inclined to utter this soul-drawn cry
after their honeymoon, if not the day after the wedding!"
"Therefore,
without entering into any more serious examination of the question, I
will content myself with remarking that in real life typical characters
are “watered down,” so to speak; and all these Dandins and Podkoleosins
actually exist among us every day, but in a diluted form."
"I will just
add, however, that Georges Dandin might have existed exactly as Molière
presented him, and probably does exist now and then, though rarely; and
so I will end this scientific examination, which is beginning to
look like a newspaper criticism."
"But for all this, the question
remains,--what are the novelists to do with commonplace people, and how
are they to be presented to the reader in such a form as to be in
the least degree interesting?"
"They cannot be left out altogether, for
commonplace people meet one at every turn of life, and to leave them out
would be to destroy the whole reality and probability of the story."
"To
fill a novel with typical characters only, or with merely strange and
uncommon people, would render the book unreal and improbable, and
would very likely destroy the interest."
"In my opinion, the duty of the
novelist is to seek out points of interest and instruction even in the
characters of commonplace people."
"For instance, when the whole essence of an ordinary person’s nature lies
in his perpetual and unchangeable commonplaceness; and when in spite of
all his endeavours to do something out of the common, this person ends,
eventually, by remaining in his unbroken line of routine--."
"I think
such an individual really does become a type of his own--a type of
commonplaceness which will not for the world, if it can help it,
be contented, but strains and yearns to be something original and
independent, without the slightest possibility of being so."
"To
this class of commonplace people belong several characters in this
novel;--characters which--I admit--I have not drawn very vividly up to
now for my reader’s benefit."
"Such were, for instance, Varvara Ardalionovna Ptitsin, her husband, and
her brother, Gania."
"There is nothing so annoying as to be fairly rich, of a fairly good
family, pleasing presence, average education, to be “not stupid,”
 kind-hearted, and yet to have no talent at all, no originality, not a
single idea of one’s own--to be, in fact, “just like everyone else.”

Of such people there are countless numbers in this world--far more even
than appear."
"They can be divided into two classes as all men can--that
is, those of limited intellect, and those who are much cleverer."
"The
former of these classes is the happier."
"To a commonplace man of limited intellect, for instance, nothing is
simpler than to imagine himself an original character, and to revel in
that belief without the slightest misgiving."
"Many of our young women have thought fit to cut their hair short, put on
blue spectacles, and call themselves Nihilists."
"By doing this they have
been able to persuade themselves, without further trouble, that they
have acquired new convictions of their own."
"Some men have but felt some
little qualm of kindness towards their fellow-men, and the fact has
been quite enough to persuade them that they stand alone in the van of
enlightenment and that no one has such humanitarian feelings as they."
"Others have but to read an idea of somebody else’s, and they can
immediately assimilate it and believe that it was a child of their own
brain."
"The “impudence of ignorance,” if I may use the expression, is
developed to a wonderful extent in such cases;--unlikely as it appears,
it is met with at every turn."
"This confidence of a stupid man in his own talents has been wonderfully
depicted by Gogol in the amazing character of Pirogoff."
"Pirogoff has
not the slightest doubt of his own genius,--nay, of his _superiority_ of
genius,--so certain is he of it that he never questions it."
"How
many Pirogoffs have there not been among our writers--scholars,
propagandists?"
"I say “have been,” but indeed there are plenty of them at
this very day."
"Our friend, Gania, belonged to the other class--to the “much cleverer”
 persons, though he was from head to foot permeated and saturated with
the longing to be original."
"This class, as I have said above, is far
less happy."
"For the “clever commonplace” person, though he may possibly
imagine himself a man of genius and originality, none the less has
within his heart the deathless worm of suspicion and doubt; and this
doubt sometimes brings a clever man to despair."
"(As a rule, however,
nothing tragic happens;--his liver becomes a little damaged in the
course of time, nothing more serious."
"Such men do not give up their
aspirations after originality without a severe struggle,--and there have
been men who, though good fellows in themselves, and even benefactors
to humanity, have sunk to the level of base criminals for the sake of
originality)."
"Gania was a beginner, as it were, upon this road."
"A deep and
unchangeable consciousness of his own lack of talent, combined with a
vast longing to be able to persuade himself that he was original, had
rankled in his heart, even from childhood."
"He seemed to have been born with overwrought nerves, and in his
passionate desire to excel, he was often led to the brink of some
rash step; and yet, having resolved upon such a step, when the moment
arrived, he invariably proved too sensible to take it."
"He was ready,
in the same way, to do a base action in order to obtain his wished-for
object; and yet, when the moment came to do it, he found that he was too
honest for any great baseness."
"(Not that he objected to acts of petty
meanness--he was always ready for _them_.)"
"He looked with hate and
loathing on the poverty and downfall of his family, and treated his
mother with haughty contempt, although he knew that his whole future
depended on her character and reputation."
"Aglaya had simply frightened him; yet he did not give up all thoughts of
her--though he never seriously hoped that she would condescend to him."
"At the time of his “adventure” with Nastasia Philipovna he had come to
the conclusion that money was his only hope--money should do all for
him."
"At the moment when he lost Aglaya, and after the scene with Nastasia, he
had felt so low in his own eyes that he actually brought the money back
to the prince."
"Of this returning of the money given to him by a madwoman
who had received it from a madman, he had often repented since--though
he never ceased to be proud of his action."
"During the short time that
Muishkin remained in Petersburg Gania had had time to come to hate him
for his sympathy, though the prince told him that it was “not everyone
who would have acted so nobly” as to return the money."
"He had long
pondered, too, over his relations with Aglaya, and had persuaded himself
that with such a strange, childish, innocent character as hers, things
might have ended very differently."
"Remorse then seized him; he threw up
his post, and buried himself in self-torment and reproach."
"He lived at Ptitsin’s, and openly showed contempt for the latter, though
he always listened to his advice, and was sensible enough to ask for it
when he wanted it."
"Gavrila Ardalionovitch was angry with Ptitsin because
the latter did not care to become a Rothschild."
"“If you are to be a
Jew,” he said, “do it properly--squeeze people right and left, show some
character; be the King of the Jews while you are about it.”

Ptitsin was quiet and not easily offended--he only laughed."
"But on one
occasion he explained seriously to Gania that he was no Jew, that he
did nothing dishonest, that he could not help the market price of money,
that, thanks to his accurate habits, he had already a good footing and
was respected, and that his business was flourishing."
"“I shan’t ever be a Rothschild, and there is no reason why I should,” he
added, smiling; “but I shall have a house in the Liteynaya, perhaps two,
and that will be enough for me.” “Who knows but what I may have three!”
 he concluded to himself; but this dream, cherished inwardly, he never
confided to a soul."
Nature loves and favours such people.
"Ptitsin will certainly have his
reward, not three houses, but four, precisely because from childhood up
he had realized that he would never be a Rothschild."
"That will be the
limit of Ptitsin’s fortune, and, come what may, he will never have more
than four houses."
Varvara Ardalionovna was not like her brother.
"She too, had passionate
desires, but they were persistent rather than impetuous."
"Her plans were
as wise as her methods of carrying them out."
"No doubt she also belonged
to the category of ordinary people who dream of being original, but she
soon discovered that she had not a grain of true originality, and she
did not let it trouble her too much."
"Perhaps a certain kind of pride
came to her help."
"She made her first concession to the demands of
practical life with great resolution when she consented to marry
Ptitsin."
"However, when she married she did not say to herself, “Never
mind a mean action if it leads to the end in view,” as her brother would
certainly have said in such a case; it is quite probable that he may
have said it when he expressed his elder-brotherly satisfaction at her
decision."
"Far from this; Varvara Ardalionovna did not marry until she
felt convinced that her future husband was unassuming, agreeable,
almost cultured, and that nothing on earth would tempt him to a really
dishonourable deed."
"As to small meannesses, such trifles did not trouble
her."
"Indeed, who is free from them?"
It is absurd to expect the ideal!
"Besides, she knew that her marriage would provide a refuge for all her
family."
"Seeing Gania unhappy, she was anxious to help him, in spite of
their former disputes and misunderstandings."
"Ptitsin, in a friendly way,
would press his brother-in-law to enter the army."
"“You know,” he said
sometimes, jokingly, “you despise generals and generaldom, but you will
see that ‘they’ will all end by being generals in their turn."
"You will
see it if you live long enough!”

“But why should they suppose that I despise generals?” Gania thought
sarcastically to himself."
"To serve her brother’s interests, Varvara Ardalionovna was constantly at
the Epanchins’ house, helped by the fact that in childhood she and Gania
had played with General Ivan Fedorovitch’s daughters."
"It would have been
inconsistent with her character if in these visits she had been pursuing
a chimera; her project was not chimerical at all; she was building on
a firm basis--on her knowledge of the character of the Epanchin family,
especially Aglaya, whom she studied closely."
"All Varvara’s efforts
were directed towards bringing Aglaya and Gania together."
"Perhaps she
achieved some result; perhaps, also, she made the mistake of depending
too much upon her brother, and expecting more from him than he would
ever be capable of giving."
"However this may be, her manoeuvres were
skilful enough."
For weeks at a time she would never mention Gania.
"Her
attitude was modest but dignified, and she was always extremely truthful
and sincere."
"Examining the depths of her conscience, she found nothing
to reproach herself with, and this still further strengthened her in
her designs."
"But Varvara Ardalionovna sometimes remarked that she felt
spiteful; that there was a good deal of vanity in her, perhaps even of
wounded vanity."
"She noticed this at certain times more than at others,
and especially after her visits to the Epanchins."
"Today, as I have said, she returned from their house with a heavy
feeling of dejection."
"There was a sensation of bitterness, a sort of
mocking contempt, mingled with it."
"Arrived at her own house, Varia heard a considerable commotion going
on in the upper storey, and distinguished the voices of her father and
brother."
"On entering the salon she found Gania pacing up and down at
frantic speed, pale with rage and almost tearing his hair."
"She frowned,
and subsided on to the sofa with a tired air, and without taking the
trouble to remove her hat."
"She very well knew that if she kept quiet and
asked her brother nothing about his reason for tearing up and down the
room, his wrath would fall upon her head."
"So she hastened to put the
question:

“The old story, eh?”

“Old story?"
No!
Heaven knows what’s up now--I don’t!
"Father has simply
gone mad; mother’s in floods of tears."
"Upon my word, Varia, I must kick
him out of the house; or else go myself,” he added, probably remembering
that he could not well turn people out of a house which was not his own."
"“You must make allowances,” murmured Varia."
“Make allowances?
For whom?
Him--the old blackguard?
"No, no, Varia--that
won’t do!"
"It won’t do, I tell you!"
And look at the swagger of the man!
"He’s all to blame himself, and yet he puts on so much ‘side’ that you’d
think--my word!--‘It’s too much trouble to go through the gate, you must
break the fence for me!’ That’s the sort of air he puts on; but what’s
the matter with you, Varia?"
"What a curious expression you have!”

“I’m all right,” said Varia, in a tone that sounded as though she were
all wrong."
Gania looked more intently at her.
"“You’ve been _there?_” he asked, suddenly."
"“Yes.”

“Did you find out anything?”

“Nothing unexpected."
I discovered that it’s all true.
"My husband was
wiser than either of us."
"Just as he suspected from the beginning, so it
has fallen out."
"Where is he?”

“Out."
"Well--what has happened?--go on.”

“The prince is formally engaged to her--that’s settled."
"The elder
sisters told me about it."
Aglaya has agreed.
"They don’t attempt to
conceal it any longer; you know how mysterious and secret they have all
been up to now."
"Adelaida’s wedding is put off again, so that both can be
married on one day."
Isn’t that delightfully romantic?
"Somebody ought to
write a poem on it."
"Sit down and write an ode instead of tearing up
and down like that."
"This evening Princess Bielokonski is to arrive; she
comes just in time--they have a party tonight."
"He is to be presented
to old Bielokonski, though I believe he knows her already; probably the
engagement will be openly announced."
"They are only afraid that he may
knock something down, or trip over something when he comes into the
room."
"It would be just like him.”

Gania listened attentively, but to his sister’s astonishment he was by
no means so impressed by this news (which should, she thought, have been
so important to him) as she had expected."
"“Well, it was clear enough all along,” he said, after a moment’s
reflection."
"“So that’s the end,” he added, with a disagreeable smile,
continuing to walk up and down the room, but much slower than before,
and glancing slyly into his sister’s face."
"“It’s a good thing that you take it philosophically, at all events,”
 said Varia."
"“I’m really very glad of it.”

“Yes, it’s off our hands--off _yours_, I should say.”

“I think I have served you faithfully."
"I never even asked you what
happiness you expected to find with Aglaya.”

“Did I ever expect to find happiness with Aglaya?”

“Come, come, don’t overdo your philosophy."
Of course you did.
"Now it’s
all over, and a good thing, too; pair of fools that we have been!"
"I
confess I have never been able to look at it seriously."
"I busied myself
in it for your sake, thinking that there was no knowing what might
happen with a funny girl like that to deal with."
"There were ninety to
one chances against it."
"To this moment I can’t make out why you wished
for it.”

“H’m!"
"now, I suppose, you and your husband will never weary of egging
me on to work again."
"You’ll begin your lectures about perseverance and
strength of will, and all that."
"I know it all by heart,” said Gania,
laughing."
"“He’s got some new idea in his head,” thought Varia."
"“Are they pleased
over there--the parents?” asked Gania, suddenly."
"“N-no, I don’t think they are."
You can judge for yourself.
"I think the
general is pleased enough; her mother is a little uneasy."
"She always
loathed the idea of the prince as a _husband_; everybody knows that.”

“Of course, naturally."
"The bridegroom is an impossible and ridiculous
one."
"I mean, has _she_ given her formal consent?”

“She has not said ‘no,’ up to now, and that’s all."
"It was sure to be so
with her."
You know what she is like.
You know how absurdly shy she is.
"You remember how she used to hide in a cupboard as a child, so as to
avoid seeing visitors, for hours at a time."
"She is just the same now;
but, do you know, I think there is something serious in the matter, even
from her side; I feel it, somehow."
"She laughs at the prince, they say,
from morn to night in order to hide her real feelings; but you may be
sure she finds occasion to say something or other to him on the sly, for
he himself is in a state of radiant happiness."
"He walks in the clouds;
they say he is extremely funny just now; I heard it from themselves."
"They seemed to be laughing at me in their sleeves--those elder girls--I
don’t know why.”

Gania had begun to frown, and probably Varia added this last sentence
in order to probe his thought."
"However, at this moment, the noise began
again upstairs."
"“I’ll turn him out!” shouted Gania, glad of the opportunity of venting
his vexation."
"“I shall just turn him out--we can’t have this.”

“Yes, and then he’ll go about the place and disgrace us as he did
yesterday.”

“How ‘as he did yesterday’?"
What do you mean?
"What did he do yesterday?”
 asked Gania, in alarm."
"“Why, goodness me, don’t you know?” Varia stopped short."
“What?
"You don’t mean to say that he went there yesterday!” cried Gania,
flushing red with shame and anger."
"“Good heavens, Varia!"
Speak!
"You have
just been there."
"_Was_ he there or not, _quick?_” And Gania rushed for the
door."
Varia followed and caught him by both hands.
“What are you doing?
Where are you going to?
"You can’t let him go now;
if you do he’ll go and do something worse.”

“What did he do there?"
"What did he say?” “They couldn’t tell me
themselves; they couldn’t make head or tail of it; but he frightened
them all."
"He came to see the general, who was not at home; so he asked
for Lizabetha Prokofievna."
"First of all, he begged her for some place,
or situation, for work of some kind, and then he began to complain about
_us_, about me and my husband, and you, especially _you_; he said a lot of
things.”

“Oh!"
"couldn’t you find out?” muttered Gania, trembling hysterically."
“No--nothing more than that.
"Why, they couldn’t understand him
themselves; and very likely didn’t tell me all.”

Gania seized his head with both hands and tottered to the window; Varia
sat down at the other window."
"“Funny girl, Aglaya,” she observed, after a pause."
"“When she left me she
said, ‘Give my special and personal respects to your parents; I shall
certainly find an opportunity to see your father one day,’ and so
serious over it."
"She’s a strange creature.”

“Wasn’t she joking?"
"She was speaking sarcastically!”

“Not a bit of it; that’s just the strange part of it.”

“Does she know about father, do you think--or not?”

“That they do _not_ know about it in the house is quite certain, the rest
of them, I mean; but you have given me an idea."
Aglaya perhaps knows.
"She alone, though, if anyone; for the sisters were as astonished as I
was to hear her speak so seriously."
"If she knows, the prince must have
told her.”

“Oh!"
it’s not a great matter to guess who told her.
A thief!
"A thief in
our family, and the head of the family, too!”

“Oh!"
"nonsense!” cried Varia, angrily."
"“That was nothing but a drunkard’s
tale."
Nonsense!
"Why, who invented the whole thing--Lebedeff and the
prince--a pretty pair!"
"Both were probably drunk.”

“Father is a drunkard and a thief; I am a beggar, and the husband of my
sister is a usurer,” continued Gania, bitterly."
"“There was a pretty list
of advantages with which to enchant the heart of Aglaya.”

“That same husband of your sister, the usurer--”

“Feeds me?"
Go on.
"Don’t stand on ceremony, pray.”

“Don’t lose your temper."
You are just like a schoolboy.
"You think that
all this sort of thing would harm you in Aglaya’s eyes, do you?"
"You
little know her character."
"She is capable of refusing the most brilliant
party, and running away and starving in a garret with some wretched
student; that’s the sort of girl she is."
"You never could or did
understand how interesting you would have seen in her eyes if you had
come firmly and proudly through our misfortunes."
"The prince has simply
caught her with hook and line; firstly, because he never thought of
fishing for her, and secondly, because he is an idiot in the eyes of
most people."
"It’s quite enough for her that by accepting him she puts
her family out and annoys them all round--that’s what she likes."
"You
don’t understand these things.”

“We shall see whether I understand or no!” said Gania, enigmatically."
"“But I shouldn’t like her to know all about father, all the same."
"I
thought the prince would manage to hold his tongue about this, at least."
"He prevented Lebedeff spreading the news--he wouldn’t even tell me all
when I asked him--”

“Then you must see that he is not responsible."
"What does it matter to
you now, in any case?"
What are you hoping for still?
"If you _have_ a hope
left, it is that your suffering air may soften her heart towards you.”

“Oh, she would funk a scandal like anyone else."
"You are all tarred with
one brush!”

“What!"
_Aglaya_ would have funked?
"You are a chicken-hearted fellow,
Gania!” said Varia, looking at her brother with contempt."
"“Not one of
us is worth much."
"Aglaya may be a wild sort of a girl, but she is far
nobler than any of us, a thousand times nobler!”

“Well--come!"
"there’s nothing to get cross about,” said Gania."
“All I’m afraid of is--mother.
"I’m afraid this scandal about father may
come to her ears; perhaps it has already."
"I am dreadfully afraid.”

“It undoubtedly has already!” observed Gania."
"Varia had risen from her place and had started to go upstairs to her
mother; but at this observation of Gania’s she turned and gazed at him
attentively."
"“Who could have told her?”

“Hippolyte, probably."
"He would think it the most delightful amusement in
the world to tell her of it the instant he moved over here; I haven’t a
doubt of it.”

“But how could he know anything of it?"
Tell me that.
"Lebedeff and the
prince determined to tell no one--even Colia knows nothing.”

“What, Hippolyte?"
"He found it out himself, of course."
"Why, you have no
idea what a cunning little animal he is; dirty little gossip!"
"He has
the most extraordinary nose for smelling out other people’s secrets, or
anything approaching to scandal."
"Believe it or not, but I’m pretty sure
he has got round Aglaya."
"If he hasn’t, he soon will."
"Rogojin is intimate
with him, too."
"How the prince doesn’t notice it, I can’t understand."
"The
little wretch considers me his enemy now and does his best to catch me
tripping."
"What on earth does it matter to him, when he’s dying?"
"However,
you’ll see; I shall catch _him_ tripping yet, and not he me.”

“Why did you get him over here, if you hate him so?"
"And is it really
worth your while to try to score off him?”

“Why, it was yourself who advised me to bring him over!”

“I thought he might be useful."
"You know he is in love with Aglaya
himself, now, and has written to her; he has even written to Lizabetha
Prokofievna!”

“Oh!"
"he’s not dangerous there!” cried Gania, laughing angrily."
"“However,
I believe there is something of that sort in the air; he is very likely
to be in love, for he is a mere boy."
"But he won’t write anonymous
letters to the old lady; that would be too audacious a thing for him to
attempt; but I dare swear the very first thing he did was to show me up
to Aglaya as a base deceiver and intriguer."
"I confess I was fool enough
to attempt something through him at first."
"I thought he would throw
himself into my service out of revengeful feelings towards the prince,
the sly little beast!"
But I know him better now.
"As for the theft, he
may have heard of it from the widow in Petersburg, for if the old man
committed himself to such an act, he can have done it for no other
object but to give the money to her."
"Hippolyte said to me, without any
prelude, that the general had promised the widow four hundred roubles."
"Of course I understood, and the little wretch looked at me with a nasty
sort of satisfaction."
"I know him; you may depend upon it he went and
told mother too, for the pleasure of wounding her."
"And why doesn’t he
die, I should like to know?"
"He undertook to die within three weeks,
and here he is getting fatter."
"His cough is better, too."
"It was only
yesterday that he said that was the second day he hadn’t coughed blood.”

“Well, turn him out!”

“I don’t _hate_, I despise him,” said Gania, grandly."
"“Well, I do hate
him, if you like!” he added, with a sudden access of rage, “and I’ll
tell him so to his face, even when he’s dying!"
"If you had but read his
confession--good Lord!"
what refinement of impudence!
"Oh, but I’d have
liked to whip him then and there, like a schoolboy, just to see how
surprised he would have been!"
"Now he hates everybody because he--Oh, I
say, what on earth are they doing there!"
Listen to that noise!
"I really
can’t stand this any longer."
"Ptitsin!” he cried, as the latter entered
the room, “what in the name of goodness are we coming to?"
"Listen to
that--”

But the noise came rapidly nearer, the door burst open, and old General
Ivolgin, raging, furious, purple-faced, and trembling with anger, rushed
in."
"He was followed by Nina Alexandrovna, Colia, and behind the rest,
Hippolyte."
II.
Hippolyte had now been five days at the Ptitsins’.
"His flitting from the
prince’s to these new quarters had been brought about quite naturally
and without many words."
"He did not quarrel with the prince--in fact,
they seemed to part as friends."
"Gania, who had been hostile enough on
that eventful evening, had himself come to see him a couple of days
later, probably in obedience to some sudden impulse."
"For some reason or
other, Rogojin too had begun to visit the sick boy."
"The prince thought
it might be better for him to move away from his (the prince’s) house."
"Hippolyte informed him, as he took his leave, that Ptitsin “had been
kind enough to offer him a corner,” and did not say a word about Gania,
though Gania had procured his invitation, and himself came to fetch him
away."
"Gania noticed this at the time, and put it to Hippolyte’s debit on
account."
"Gania was right when he told his sister that Hippolyte was getting
better; that he was better was clear at the first glance."
"He entered the
room now last of all, deliberately, and with a disagreeable smile on his
lips."
"Nina Alexandrovna came in, looking frightened."
"She had changed much
since we last saw her, half a year ago, and had grown thin and pale."
Colia looked worried and perplexed.
"He could not understand the vagaries
of the general, and knew nothing of the last achievement of that worthy,
which had caused so much commotion in the house."
"But he could see that
his father had of late changed very much, and that he had begun to
behave in so extraordinary a fashion both at home and abroad that he
was not like the same man."
"What perplexed and disturbed him as much as
anything was that his father had entirely given up drinking during the
last few days."
"Colia knew that he had quarrelled with both Lebedeff and
the prince, and had just bought a small bottle of vodka and brought it
home for his father."
"“Really, mother,” he had assured Nina Alexandrovna upstairs, “really you
had better let him drink."
"He has not had a drop for three days; he must
be suffering agonies--” The general now entered the room, threw the door
wide open, and stood on the threshold trembling with indignation."
"“Look here, my dear sir,” he began, addressing Ptitsin in a very loud
tone of voice; “if you have really made up your mind to sacrifice an old
man--your father too or at all events father of your wife--an old man
who has served his emperor--to a wretched little atheist like this, all
I can say is, sir, my foot shall cease to tread your floors."
"Make your
choice, sir; make your choice quickly, if you please!"
Me or this--screw!
"Yes, screw, sir; I said it accidentally, but let the word stand--this
screw, for he screws and drills himself into my soul--”

“Hadn’t you better say corkscrew?” said Hippolyte."
"“No, sir, _not_ corkscrew."
"I am a general, not a bottle, sir."
"Make your
choice, sir--me or him.”

Here Colia handed him a chair, and he subsided into it, breathless with
rage."
“Hadn’t you better--better--take a nap?” murmured the stupefied Ptitsin.
“A nap?” shrieked the general.
"“I am not drunk, sir; you insult me!"
"I see,” he continued, rising, “I see that all are against me here."
"Enough--I go; but know, sirs--know that--”

He was not allowed to finish his sentence."
"Somebody pushed him back into
his chair, and begged him to be calm."
"Nina Alexandrovna trembled, and
cried quietly."
Gania retired to the window in disgust.
“But what have I done?
"What is his grievance?” asked Hippolyte,
grinning."
"“What have you done, indeed?” put in Nina Alexandrovna."
"“You ought to be
ashamed of yourself, teasing an old man like that--and in your position,
too.”

“And pray what _is_ my position, madame?"
"I have the greatest respect for
you, personally; but--”

“He’s a little screw,” cried the general; “he drills holes in my heart
and soul."
He wishes me to be a pervert to atheism.
"Know, you young
greenhorn, that I was covered with honours before ever you were born;
and you are nothing better than a wretched little worm, torn in two with
coughing, and dying slowly of your own malice and unbelief."
"What did
Gavrila bring you over here for?"
"They’re all against me, even to my own
son--all against me.”

“Oh, come--nonsense!” cried Gania; “if you did not go shaming us all
over the town, things might be better for all parties.”

“What--shame you?"
"I?--what do you mean, you young calf?"
I shame you?
"I
can only do you honour, sir; I cannot shame you.”

He jumped up from his chair in a fit of uncontrollable rage."
"Gania was
very angry too."
"“Honour, indeed!” said the latter, with contempt."
"“What do you say, sir?” growled the general, taking a step towards him."
"“I say that I have but to open my mouth, and you--”

Gania began, but did not finish."
"The two--father and son--stood before
one another, both unspeakably agitated, especially Gania."
"“Gania, Gania, reflect!” cried his mother, hurriedly."
"“It’s all nonsense on both sides,” snapped out Varia."
"“Let them alone,
mother.”

“It’s only for mother’s sake that I spare him,” said Gania, tragically."
"“Speak!” said the general, beside himself with rage and excitement;
“speak--under the penalty of a father’s curse!”

“Oh, father’s curse be hanged--you don’t frighten me that way!” said
Gania."
"“Whose fault is it that you have been as mad as a March hare all
this week?"
"It is just a week--you see, I count the days."
"Take care
now; don’t provoke me too much, or I’ll tell all."
"Why did you go to the
Epanchins’ yesterday--tell me that?"
"And you call yourself an old
man, too, with grey hair, and father of a family!"
"H’m--nice sort of a
father.”

“Be quiet, Gania,” cried Colia."
"“Shut up, you fool!”

“Yes, but how have I offended him?” repeated Hippolyte, still in the
same jeering voice."
“Why does he call me a screw?
You all heard it.
"He
came to me himself and began telling me about some Captain Eropegoff."
"I don’t wish for your company, general."
"I always avoided you--you know
that."
What have I to do with Captain Eropegoff?
"All I did was to express
my opinion that probably Captain Eropegoff never existed at all!”

“Of course he never existed!” Gania interrupted."
But the general only stood stupefied and gazed around in a dazed way.
"Gania’s speech had impressed him, with its terrible candour."
"For the
first moment or two he could find no words to answer him, and it was
only when Hippolyte burst out laughing, and said:

“There, you see!"
"Even your own son supports my statement that there
never was such a person as Captain Eropegoff!” that the old fellow
muttered confusedly:

“Kapiton Eropegoff--not Captain Eropegoff!--Kapiton--major
retired--Eropegoff--Kapiton.”

“Kapiton didn’t exist either!” persisted Gania, maliciously."
“What?
"Didn’t exist?” cried the poor general, and a deep blush suffused
his face."
"“That’ll do, Gania!” cried Varia and Ptitsin."
"“Shut up, Gania!” said Colia."
But this intercession seemed to rekindle the general.
"“What did you mean, sir, that he didn’t exist?"
"Explain yourself,” he
repeated, angrily."
“Because he _didn’t_ exist--never could and never did--there!
"You’d better
drop the subject, I warn you!”

“And this is my son--my own son--whom I--oh, gracious Heaven!"
"Eropegoff--Eroshka Eropegoff didn’t exist!”

“Ha, ha!"
"it’s Eroshka now,” laughed Hippolyte."
"“No, sir, Kapitoshka--not Eroshka."
"I mean, Kapiton Alexeyevitch--retired
major--married Maria Petrovna Lu--Lu--he was my friend and
companion--Lutugoff--from our earliest beginnings."
"I closed his eyes for
him--he was killed."
Kapiton Eropegoff never existed!
"tfu!”

The general shouted in his fury; but it was to be concluded that his
wrath was not kindled by the expressed doubt as to Kapiton’s existence."
"This was his scapegoat; but his excitement was caused by something quite
different."
"As a rule he would have merely shouted down the doubt as
to Kapiton, told a long yarn about his friend, and eventually retired
upstairs to his room."
"But today, in the strange uncertainty of human
nature, it seemed to require but so small an offence as this to make
his cup to overflow."
"The old man grew purple in the face, he raised his
hands."
“Enough of this!” he yelled.
"“My curse--away, out of the house
I go!"
"Colia, bring my bag away!” He left the room hastily and in a
paroxysm of rage."
"His wife, Colia, and Ptitsin ran out after him."
“What have you done now?” said Varia to Gania.
"“He’ll probably be making
off _there_ again!"
"What a disgrace it all is!”

“Well, he shouldn’t steal,” cried Gania, panting with fury."
"And just at
this moment his eye met Hippolyte’s."
"“As for you, sir,” he cried, “you should at least remember that you are
in a strange house and--receiving hospitality; you should not take the
opportunity of tormenting an old man, sir, who is too evidently out of
his mind.”

Hippolyte looked furious, but he restrained himself."
"“I don’t quite agree with you that your father is out of his mind,” he
observed, quietly."
"“On the contrary, I cannot help thinking he has been
less demented of late."
Don’t you think so?
"He has grown so cunning and
careful, and weighs his words so deliberately; he spoke to me about that
Kapiton fellow with an object, you know!"
"Just fancy--he wanted me to--”

“Oh, devil take what he wanted you to do!"
"Don’t try to be too cunning
with me, young man!” shouted Gania."
"“If you are aware of the real reason
for my father’s present condition (and you have kept such an excellent
spying watch during these last few days that you are sure to be aware of
it)--you had no right whatever to torment the--unfortunate man, and to
worry my mother by your exaggerations of the affair; because the whole
business is nonsense--simply a drunken freak, and nothing more, quite
unproved by any evidence, and I don’t believe that much of it!” (he
snapped his fingers)."
"“But you must needs spy and watch over us all,
because you are a--a--”

“Screw!” laughed Hippolyte."
"“Because you are a humbug, sir; and thought fit to worry people for half
an hour, and tried to frighten them into believing that you would shoot
yourself with your little empty pistol, pirouetting about and playing at
suicide!"
"I gave you hospitality, you have fattened on it, your cough has
left you, and you repay all this--”

“Excuse me--two words!"
"I am Varvara Ardalionovna’s guest, not yours;
_you_ have extended no hospitality to me."
"On the contrary, if I am
not mistaken, I believe you are yourself indebted to Mr. Ptitsin’s
hospitality."
"Four days ago I begged my mother to come down here and find
lodgings, because I certainly do feel better here, though I am not fat,
nor have I ceased to cough."
"I am today informed that my room is ready
for me; therefore, having thanked your sister and mother for their
kindness to me, I intend to leave the house this evening."
"I beg your
pardon--I interrupted you--I think you were about to add something?”

“Oh--if that is the state of affairs--” began Gania."
"“Excuse me--I will take a seat,” interrupted Hippolyte once more,
sitting down deliberately; “for I am not strong yet."
"Now then, I am
ready to hear you."
"Especially as this is the last chance we shall have
of a talk, and very likely the last meeting we shall ever have at all.”

Gania felt a little guilty."
"“I assure you I did not mean to reckon up debits and credits,” he began,
“and if you--”

“I don’t understand your condescension,” said Hippolyte."
"“As for me, I
promised myself, on the first day of my arrival in this house, that
I would have the satisfaction of settling accounts with you in a very
thorough manner before I said good-bye to you."
"I intend to perform this
operation now, if you like; after you, though, of course.”

“May I ask you to be so good as to leave this room?”

“You’d better speak out."
"You’ll be sorry afterwards if you don’t.”

“Hippolyte, stop, please!"
"It’s so dreadfully undignified,” said Varia."
"“Well, only for the sake of a lady,” said Hippolyte, laughing."
"“I
am ready to put off the reckoning, but only put it off, Varvara
Ardalionovna, because an explanation between your brother and myself has
become an absolute necessity, and I could not think of leaving the house
without clearing up all misunderstandings first.”

“In a word, you are a wretched little scandal-monger,” cried Gania, “and
you cannot go away without a scandal!”

“You see,” said Hippolyte, coolly, “you can’t restrain yourself."
"You’ll
be dreadfully sorry afterwards if you don’t speak out now."
"Come, you
shall have the first say."
"I’ll wait.”

Gania was silent and merely looked contemptuously at him."
“You won’t?
Very well.
"I shall be as short as possible, for my part."
"Two
or three times to-day I have had the word ‘hospitality’ pushed down my
throat; this is not fair."
"In inviting me here you yourself entrapped
me for your own use; you thought I wished to revenge myself upon the
prince."
"You heard that Aglaya Ivanovna had been kind to me and read my
confession."
"Making sure that I should give myself up to your interests,
you hoped that you might get some assistance out of me."
"I will not go
into details."
"I don’t ask either admission or confirmation of this from
yourself; I am quite content to leave you to your conscience, and to
feel that we understand one another capitally.”

“What a history you are weaving out of the most ordinary circumstances!”
 cried Varia."
"“I told you the fellow was nothing but a scandal-monger,” said Gania."
"“Excuse me, Varia Ardalionovna, I will proceed."
"I can, of course,
neither love nor respect the prince, though he is a good-hearted fellow,
if a little queer."
But there is no need whatever for me to hate him.
"I
quite understood your brother when he first offered me aid against the
prince, though I did not show it; I knew well that your brother was
making a ridiculous mistake in me."
"I am ready to spare him, however,
even now; but solely out of respect for yourself, Varvara Ardalionovna."
"“Having now shown you that I am not quite such a fool as I look, and
that I have to be fished for with a rod and line for a good long while
before I am caught, I will proceed to explain why I specially wished to
make your brother look a fool."
"That my motive power is hate, I do not
attempt to conceal."
"I have felt that before dying (and I am dying,
however much fatter I may appear to you), I must absolutely make a fool
of, at least, one of that class of men which has dogged me all my life,
which I hate so cordially, and which is so prominently represented by
your much esteemed brother."
"I should not enjoy paradise nearly so much
without having done this first."
"I hate you, Gavrila Ardalionovitch,
solely (this may seem curious to you, but I repeat)--solely because you
are the type, and incarnation, and head, and crown of the most impudent,
the most self-satisfied, the most vulgar and detestable form of
commonplaceness."
"You are ordinary of the ordinary; you have no chance of
ever fathering the pettiest idea of your own."
"And yet you are as jealous
and conceited as you can possibly be; you consider yourself a great
genius; of this you are persuaded, although there are dark moments of
doubt and rage, when even this fact seems uncertain."
"There are spots
of darkness on your horizon, though they will disappear when you become
completely stupid."
"But a long and chequered path lies before you, and
of this I am glad."
"In the first place you will never gain a certain
person.”

“Come, come!"
This is intolerable!
"You had better stop, you little
mischief-making wretch!” cried Varia."
"Gania had grown very pale; he
trembled, but said nothing."
"Hippolyte paused, and looked at him intently and with great
gratification."
"He then turned his gaze upon Varia, bowed, and went out,
without adding another word."
Gania might justly complain of the hardness with which fate treated him.
"Varia dared not speak to him for a long while, as he strode past her,
backwards and forwards."
"At last he went and stood at the window, looking
out, with his back turned towards her."
"There was a fearful row going on
upstairs again."
"“Are you off?” said Gania, suddenly, remarking that she had risen and
was about to leave the room."
"“Wait a moment--look at this.”

He approached the table and laid a small sheet of paper before her."
"It
looked like a little note."
"“Good heavens!” cried Varia, raising her hands."
"This was the note:

“GAVRILA ARDOLIONOVITCH,--persuaded of your kindness of heart, I have
determined to ask your advice on a matter of great importance to myself."
"I should like to meet you tomorrow morning at seven o’clock by the green
bench in the park."
It is not far from our house.
"Varvara Ardalionovna,
who must accompany you, knows the place well."
“A.
"E.”

“What on earth is one to make of a girl like that?” said Varia."
"Gania, little as he felt inclined for swagger at this moment, could
not avoid showing his triumph, especially just after such humiliating
remarks as those of Hippolyte."
"A smile of self-satisfaction beamed on
his face, and Varia too was brimming over with delight."
“And this is the very day that they were to announce the engagement!
"What will she do next?”

“What do you suppose she wants to talk about tomorrow?” asked Gania."
"“Oh, _that’s_ all the same!"
"The chief thing is that she wants to see you
after six months’ absence."
"Look here, Gania, this is a _serious_ business."
"Don’t swagger again and lose the game--play carefully, but don’t funk,
do you understand?"
"As if she could possibly avoid seeing what I have
been working for all this last six months!"
"And just imagine, I was there
this morning and not a word of this!"
"I was there, you know, on the sly."
"The old lady did not know, or she would have kicked me out."
"I ran some
risk for you, you see."
"I did so want to find out, at all hazards.”

Here there was a frantic noise upstairs once more; several people seemed
to be rushing downstairs at once."
"“Now, Gania,” cried Varia, frightened, “we can’t let him go out!"
"We
can’t afford to have a breath of scandal about the town at this moment."
"Run after him and beg his pardon--quick.”

But the father of the family was out in the road already."
"Colia was
carrying his bag for him; Nina Alexandrovna stood and cried on the
doorstep; she wanted to run after the general, but Ptitsin kept her
back."
"“You will only excite him more,” he said."
"“He has nowhere else to go
to--he’ll be back here in half an hour."
"I’ve talked it all over with
Colia; let him play the fool a bit, it will do him good.”

“What are you up to?"
Where are you off to?
"You’ve nowhere to go to, you
know,” cried Gania, out of the window."
"“Come back, father; the neighbours will hear!” cried Varia."
"The general stopped, turned round, raised his hands and remarked: “My
curse be upon this house!”

“Which observation should always be made in as theatrical a tone as
possible,” muttered Gania, shutting the window with a bang."
The neighbours undoubtedly did hear.
Varia rushed out of the room.
"No sooner had his sister left him alone, than Gania took the note out of
his pocket, kissed it, and pirouetted around."
III.
"As a general rule, old General Ivolgin’s paroxysms ended in smoke."
"He
had before this experienced fits of sudden fury, but not very often,
because he was really a man of peaceful and kindly disposition."
"He had
tried hundreds of times to overcome the dissolute habits which he had
contracted of late years."
"He would suddenly remember that he was “a
father,” would be reconciled with his wife, and shed genuine tears."
"His feeling for Nina Alexandrovna amounted almost to adoration; she had
pardoned so much in silence, and loved him still in spite of the state
of degradation into which he had fallen."
"But the general’s struggles
with his own weakness never lasted very long."
"He was, in his way, an
impetuous man, and a quiet life of repentance in the bosom of his family
soon became insupportable to him."
"In the end he rebelled, and flew into
rages which he regretted, perhaps, even as he gave way to them, but
which were beyond his control."
"He picked quarrels with everyone,
began to hold forth eloquently, exacted unlimited respect, and at last
disappeared from the house, and sometimes did not return for a long
time."
"He had given up interfering in the affairs of his family for
two years now, and knew nothing about them but what he gathered from
hearsay."
But on this occasion there was something more serious than usual.
"Everyone seemed to know something, but to be afraid to talk about it."
"The general had turned up in the bosom of his family two or three days
before, but not, as usual, with the olive branch of peace in his hand,
not in the garb of penitence--in which he was usually clad on such
occasions--but, on the contrary, in an uncommonly bad temper."
"He had
arrived in a quarrelsome mood, pitching into everyone he came across,
and talking about all sorts and kinds of subjects in the most unexpected
manner, so that it was impossible to discover what it was that was
really putting him out."
"At moments he would be apparently quite bright
and happy; but as a rule he would sit moody and thoughtful."
"He would
abruptly commence to hold forth about the Epanchins, about Lebedeff, or
the prince, and equally abruptly would stop short and refuse to speak
another word, answering all further questions with a stupid smile,
unconscious that he was smiling, or that he had been asked a question."
"The whole of the previous night he had spent tossing about and groaning,
and poor Nina Alexandrovna had been busy making cold compresses and warm
fomentations and so on, without being very clear how to apply them."
"He
had fallen asleep after a while, but not for long, and had awaked in
a state of violent hypochondria which had ended in his quarrel with
Hippolyte, and the solemn cursing of Ptitsin’s establishment generally."
"It was also observed during those two or three days that he was in a
state of morbid self-esteem, and was specially touchy on all points of
honour."
"Colia insisted, in discussing the matter with his mother, that
all this was but the outcome of abstinence from drink, or perhaps of
pining after Lebedeff, with whom up to this time the general had been
upon terms of the greatest friendship; but with whom, for some reason
or other, he had quarrelled a few days since, parting from him in great
wrath."
There had also been a scene with the prince.
"Colia had asked an
explanation of the latter, but had been forced to conclude that he was
not told the whole truth."
"If Hippolyte and Nina Alexandrovna had, as Gania suspected, had some
special conversation about the general’s actions, it was strange that
the malicious youth, whom Gania had called a scandal-monger to his face,
had not allowed himself a similar satisfaction with Colia."
"The fact is that probably Hippolyte was not quite so black as Gania
painted him; and it was hardly likely that he had informed Nina
Alexandrovna of certain events, of which we know, for the mere pleasure
of giving her pain."
"We must never forget that human motives are
generally far more complicated than we are apt to suppose, and that we
can very rarely accurately describe the motives of another."
"It is much
better for the writer, as a rule, to content himself with the bare
statement of events; and we shall take this line with regard to the
catastrophe recorded above, and shall state the remaining events
connected with the general’s trouble shortly, because we feel that
we have already given to this secondary character in our story more
attention than we originally intended."
The course of events had marched in the following order.
"When Lebedeff
returned, in company with the general, after their expedition to town a
few days since, for the purpose of investigation, he brought the prince
no information whatever."
"If the latter had not himself been occupied
with other thoughts and impressions at the time, he must have observed
that Lebedeff not only was very uncommunicative, but even appeared
anxious to avoid him."
"When the prince did give the matter a little attention, he recalled
the fact that during these days he had always found Lebedeff to be in
radiantly good spirits, when they happened to meet; and further, that
the general and Lebedeff were always together."
"The two friends did not
seem ever to be parted for a moment."
"Occasionally the prince heard loud talking and laughing upstairs, and
once he detected the sound of a jolly soldier’s song going on above, and
recognized the unmistakable bass of the general’s voice."
"But the sudden
outbreak of song did not last; and for an hour afterwards the animated
sound of apparently drunken conversation continued to be heard from
above."
"At length there was the clearest evidence of a grand mutual
embracing, and someone burst into tears."
"Shortly after this, however,
there was a violent but short-lived quarrel, with loud talking on both
sides."
All these days Colia had been in a state of great mental preoccupation.
"Muishkin was usually out all day, and only came home late at night."
"On
his return he was invariably informed that Colia had been looking for
him."
"However, when they did meet, Colia never had anything particular to
tell him, excepting that he was highly dissatisfied with the general and
his present condition of mind and behaviour."
"“They drag each other about the place,” he said, “and get drunk together
at the pub close by here, and quarrel in the street on the way home, and
embrace one another after it, and don’t seem to part for a moment.”

When the prince pointed out that there was nothing new about that, for
that they had always behaved in this manner together, Colia did not know
what to say; in fact he could not explain what it was that specially
worried him, just now, about his father."
"On the morning following the bacchanalian songs and quarrels recorded
above, as the prince stepped out of the house at about eleven o’clock,
the general suddenly appeared before him, much agitated."
"“I have long sought the honour and opportunity of meeting
you--much-esteemed Lef Nicolaievitch,” he murmured, pressing the
prince’s hand very hard, almost painfully so; “long--very long.”

The prince begged him to step in and sit down."
"“No--I will not sit down,--I am keeping you, I see,--another time!--I
think I may be permitted to congratulate you upon the realization of
your heart’s best wishes, is it not so?”

“What best wishes?”

The prince blushed."
"He thought, as so many in his position do, that
nobody had seen, heard, noticed, or understood anything."
"“Oh--be easy, sir, be easy!"
I shall not wound your tenderest feelings.
"I’ve been through it all myself, and I know well how unpleasant it is
when an outsider sticks his nose in where he is not wanted."
"I experience
this every morning."
"I came to speak to you about another matter, though,
an important matter."
"A very important matter, prince.”

The latter requested him to take a seat once more, and sat down himself."
"“Well--just for one second, then."
"The fact is, I came for advice."
"Of
course I live now without any very practical objects in life; but,
being full of self-respect, in which quality the ordinary Russian is so
deficient as a rule, and of activity, I am desirous, in a word, prince,
of placing myself and my wife and children in a position of--in fact, I
want advice.”

The prince commended his aspirations with warmth."
“Quite so--quite so!
But this is all mere nonsense.
"I came here to speak
of something quite different, something very important, prince."
"And
I have determined to come to you as to a man in whose sincerity and
nobility of feeling I can trust like--like--are you surprised at my
words, prince?”

The prince was watching his guest, if not with much surprise, at all
events with great attention and curiosity."
"The old man was very pale; every now and then his lips trembled, and his
hands seemed unable to rest quietly, but continually moved from place to
place."
"He had twice already jumped up from his chair and sat down again
without being in the least aware of it."
"He would take up a book from
the table and open it--talking all the while,--look at the heading of a
chapter, shut it and put it back again, seizing another immediately, but
holding it unopened in his hand, and waving it in the air as he spoke."
"“But enough!” he cried, suddenly."
"“I see I have been boring you with
my--”

“Not in the least--not in the least, I assure you."
"On the contrary, I am
listening most attentively, and am anxious to guess--”

“Prince, I wish to place myself in a respectable position--I wish to
esteem myself--and to--”

“My dear sir, a man of such noble aspirations is worthy of all esteem by
virtue of those aspirations alone.”

The prince brought out his “copy-book sentence” in the firm belief that
it would produce a good effect."
"He felt instinctively that some such
well-sounding humbug, brought out at the proper moment, would soothe the
old man’s feelings, and would be specially acceptable to such a man in
such a position."
"At all hazards, his guest must be despatched with heart
relieved and spirit comforted; that was the problem before the prince at
this moment."
"The phrase flattered the general, touched him, and pleased him mightily."
"He immediately changed his tone, and started off on a long and solemn
explanation."
"But listen as he would, the prince could make neither head
nor tail of it."
"The general spoke hotly and quickly for ten minutes; he spoke as though
his words could not keep pace with his crowding thoughts."
"Tears stood
in his eyes, and yet his speech was nothing but a collection of
disconnected sentences, without beginning and without end--a string of
unexpected words and unexpected sentiments--colliding with one another,
and jumping over one another, as they burst from his lips."
"“Enough!” he concluded at last, “you understand me, and that is the
great thing."
"A heart like yours cannot help understanding the sufferings
of another."
"Prince, you are the ideal of generosity; what are other men
beside yourself?"
But you are young--accept my blessing!
"My
principal object is to beg you to fix an hour for a most important
conversation--that is my great hope, prince."
"My heart needs but a little
friendship and sympathy, and yet I cannot always find means to satisfy
it.”

“But why not now?"
"I am ready to listen, and--”

“No, no--prince, not now!"
Now is a dream!
"And it is too, too important!"
It is to be the hour of Fate to me--_my own_ hour.
"Our interview is not
to be broken in upon by every chance comer, every impertinent guest--and
there are plenty of such stupid, impertinent fellows”--(he bent over and
whispered mysteriously, with a funny, frightened look on his face)--“who
are unworthy to tie your shoe, prince."
"I don’t say _mine_, mind--you will
understand me, prince."
"Only _you_ understand me, prince--no one else."
"_He_ doesn’t understand me, he is absolutely--_absolutely_ unable to
sympathize."
"The first qualification for understanding another is Heart.”

The prince was rather alarmed at all this, and was obliged to end by
appointing the same hour of the following day for the interview desired."
"The general left him much comforted and far less agitated than when he
had arrived."
"At seven in the evening, the prince sent to request Lebedeff to pay
him a visit."
"Lebedeff came at once, and “esteemed it an honour,” as he
observed, the instant he entered the room."
"He acted as though there
had never been the slightest suspicion of the fact that he had
systematically avoided the prince for the last three days."
"He sat down on the edge of his chair, smiling and making faces,
and rubbing his hands, and looking as though he were in delighted
expectation of hearing some important communication, which had been long
guessed by all."
"The prince was instantly covered with confusion; for it appeared to be
plain that everyone expected something of him--that everyone looked at
him as though anxious to congratulate him, and greeted him with hints,
and smiles, and knowing looks."
"Keller, for instance, had run into the house three times of late, “just
for a moment,” and each time with the air of desiring to offer his
congratulations."
"Colia, too, in spite of his melancholy, had once
or twice begun sentences in much the same strain of suggestion or
insinuation."
"The prince, however, immediately began, with some show of annoyance, to
question Lebedeff categorically, as to the general’s present condition,
and his opinion thereon."
"He described the morning’s interview in a few
words."
"“Everyone has his worries, prince, especially in these strange and
troublous times of ours,” Lebedeff replied, drily, and with the air of a
man disappointed of his reasonable expectations."
"“Dear me, what a philosopher you are!” laughed the prince."
"“Philosophy is necessary, sir--very necessary--in our day."
"It is too
much neglected."
"As for me, much esteemed prince, I am sensible of having
experienced the honour of your confidence in a certain matter up to
a certain point, but never beyond that point."
"I do not for a moment
complain--”

“Lebedeff, you seem to be angry for some reason!” said the prince."
"“Not the least bit in the world, esteemed and revered prince!"
"Not the
least bit in the world!” cried Lebedeff, solemnly, with his hand upon
his heart."
"“On the contrary, I am too painfully aware that neither by my
position in the world, nor by my gifts of intellect and heart, nor by
my riches, nor by any former conduct of mine, have I in any way deserved
your confidence, which is far above my highest aspirations and hopes."
"Oh no, prince; I may serve you, but only as your humble slave!"
"I am not
angry, oh no!"
"Not angry; pained perhaps, but nothing more.”

“My dear Lebedeff, I--”

“Oh, nothing more, nothing more!"
"I was saying to myself but now... ‘I am
quite unworthy of friendly relations with him,’ say I; ‘but perhaps as
landlord of this house I may, at some future date, in his good time,
receive information as to certain imminent and much to be desired
changes--’”

So saying Lebedeff fixed the prince with his sharp little eyes, still in
hope that he would get his curiosity satisfied."
The prince looked back at him in amazement.
"“I don’t understand what you are driving at!” he cried, almost angrily,
“and, and--what an intriguer you are, Lebedeff!” he added, bursting into
a fit of genuine laughter."
"Lebedeff followed suit at once, and it was clear from his radiant face
that he considered his prospects of satisfaction immensely improved."
"“And do you know,” the prince continued, “I am amazed at your naive
ways, Lebedeff!"
"Don’t be angry with me--not only yours, everybody else’s
also!"
"You are waiting to hear something from me at this very moment with
such simplicity that I declare I feel quite ashamed of myself for having
nothing whatever to tell you."
"I swear to you solemnly, that there is
nothing to tell."
There!
Can you take that in?” The prince laughed again.
Lebedeff assumed an air of dignity.
"It was true enough that he was
sometimes naive to a degree in his curiosity; but he was also an
excessively cunning gentleman, and the prince was almost converting
him into an enemy by his repeated rebuffs."
"The prince did not snub
Lebedeff’s curiosity, however, because he felt any contempt for him; but
simply because the subject was too delicate to talk about."
"Only a few
days before he had looked upon his own dreams almost as crimes."
"But
Lebedeff considered the refusal as caused by personal dislike to
himself, and was hurt accordingly."
"Indeed, there was at this moment a
piece of news, most interesting to the prince, which Lebedeff knew
and even had wished to tell him, but which he now kept obstinately to
himself."
"“And what can I do for you, esteemed prince?"
"Since I am told you sent
for me just now,” he said, after a few moments’ silence."
"“Oh, it was about the general,” began the prince, waking abruptly from
the fit of musing which he too had indulged in “and--and about the theft
you told me of.”

“That is--er--about--what theft?”

“Oh come!"
"just as if you didn’t understand, Lukian Timofeyovitch!"
"What
are you up to?"
I can’t make you out!
"The money, the money, sir!"
"The four
hundred roubles that you lost that day."
"You came and told me about
it one morning, and then went off to Petersburg."
"There, _now_ do you
understand?”

“Oh--h--h!"
"You mean the four hundred roubles!” said Lebedeff, dragging
the words out, just as though it had only just dawned upon him what
the prince was talking about."
"“Thanks very much, prince, for your kind
interest--you do me too much honour."
"I found the money, long ago!”

“You found it?"
"Thank God for that!”

“Your exclamation proves the generous sympathy of your nature, prince;
for four hundred roubles--to a struggling family man like myself--is no
small matter!”

“I didn’t mean that; at least, of course, I’m glad for your sake, too,”
 added the prince, correcting himself, “but--how did you find it?”

“Very simply indeed!"
"I found it under the chair upon which my coat had
hung; so that it is clear the purse simply fell out of the pocket and on
to the floor!”

“Under the chair?"
Impossible!
"Why, you told me yourself that you had
searched every corner of the room?"
"How could you not have looked in the
most likely place of all?”

“Of course I looked there,--of course I did!"
Very much so!
"I looked and
scrambled about, and felt for it, and wouldn’t believe it was not there,
and looked again and again."
It is always so in such cases.
"One longs and
expects to find a lost article; one sees it is not there, and the place
is as bare as one’s palm; and yet one returns and looks again and again,
fifteen or twenty times, likely enough!”

“Oh, quite so, of course."
"But how was it in your case?--I don’t quite
understand,” said the bewildered prince."
"“You say it wasn’t there at
first, and that you searched the place thoroughly, and yet it turned up
on that very spot!”

“Yes, sir--on that very spot.” The prince gazed strangely at Lebedeff."
"“And the general?” he asked, abruptly."
“The--the general?
"How do you mean, the general?” said Lebedeff,
dubiously, as though he had not taken in the drift of the prince’s
remark."
"“Oh, good heavens!"
"I mean, what did the general say when the purse
turned up under the chair?"
"You and he had searched for it together
there, hadn’t you?”

“Quite so--together!"
"But the second time I thought better to say nothing
about finding it."
"I found it alone.”

“But--why in the world--and the money?"
"Was it all there?”

“I opened the purse and counted it myself; right to a single rouble.”

“I think you might have come and told me,” said the prince,
thoughtfully."
"“Oh--I didn’t like to disturb you, prince, in the midst of your private
and doubtless most interesting personal reflections."
"Besides, I wanted
to appear, myself, to have found nothing."
"I took the purse, and opened
it, and counted the money, and shut it and put it down again under the
chair.”

“What in the world for?”

“Oh, just out of curiosity,” said Lebedeff, rubbing his hands and
sniggering."
"“What, it’s still there then, is it?"
"Ever since the day before
yesterday?”

“Oh no!"
"You see, I was half in hopes the general might find it."
"Because
if I found it, why should not he too observe an object lying before his
very eyes?"
"I moved the chair several times so as to expose the purse
to view, but the general never saw it."
"He is very absent just now,
evidently."
"He talks and laughs and tells stories, and suddenly flies
into a rage with me, goodness knows why.”

“Well, but--have you taken the purse away now?”

“No, it disappeared from under the chair in the night.”

“Where is it now, then?”

“Here,” laughed Lebedeff, at last, rising to his full height and looking
pleasantly at the prince, “here, in the lining of my coat."
"Look, you can
feel it for yourself, if you like!”

Sure enough there was something sticking out of the front of the
coat--something large."
"It certainly felt as though it might well be the
purse fallen through a hole in the pocket into the lining."
“I took it out and had a look at it; it’s all right.
"I’ve let it slip
back into the lining now, as you see, and so I have been walking about
ever since yesterday morning; it knocks against my legs when I walk
along.”

“H’m!"
"and you take no notice of it?”

“Quite so, I take no notice of it."
"Ha, ha!"
"and think of this, prince,
my pockets are always strong and whole, and yet, here in one night, is a
huge hole."
"I know the phenomenon is unworthy of your notice; but such is
the case."
"I examined the hole, and I declare it actually looks as though
it had been made with a pen-knife, a most improbable contingency.”

“And--and--the general?”

“Ah, very angry all day, sir; all yesterday and all today."
"He shows
decided bacchanalian predilections at one time, and at another is
tearful and sensitive, but at any moment he is liable to paroxysms of
such rage that I assure you, prince, I am quite alarmed."
"I am not
a military man, you know."
"Yesterday we were sitting together in
the tavern, and the lining of my coat was--quite accidentally, of
course--sticking out right in front."
"The general squinted at it, and
flew into a rage."
"He never looks me quite in the face now, unless he is
very drunk or maudlin; but yesterday he looked at me in such a way that
a shiver went all down my back."
"I intend to find the purse tomorrow; but
till then I am going to have another night of it with him.”

“What’s the good of tormenting him like this?” cried the prince."
"“I don’t torment him, prince, I don’t indeed!” cried Lebedeff, hotly."
"“I
love him, my dear sir, I esteem him; and believe it or not, I love him
all the better for this business, yes--and value him more.”

Lebedeff said this so seriously that the prince quite lost his temper
with him."
“Nonsense!
love him and torment him so!
"Why, by the very fact that he
put the purse prominently before you, first under the chair and then
in your lining, he shows that he does not wish to deceive you, but is
anxious to beg your forgiveness in this artless way."
Do you hear?
"He is
asking your pardon."
"He confides in the delicacy of your feelings, and
in your friendship for him."
"And you can allow yourself to humiliate so
thoroughly honest a man!”

“Thoroughly honest, quite so, prince, thoroughly honest!” said Lebedeff,
with flashing eyes."
"“And only you, prince, could have found so very
appropriate an expression."
"I honour you for it, prince."
"Very well,
that’s settled; I shall find the purse now and not tomorrow."
"Here, I
find it and take it out before your eyes!"
And the money is all right.
"Take it, prince, and keep it till tomorrow, will you?"
"Tomorrow or next
day I’ll take it back again."
"I think, prince, that the night after
its disappearance it was buried under a bush in the garden."
"So I
believe--what do you think of that?”

“Well, take care you don’t tell him to his face that you have found the
purse."
"Simply let him see that it is no longer in the lining of your
coat, and form his own conclusions.”

“Do you think so?"
"Had I not just better tell him I have found it, and
pretend I never guessed where it was?”

“No, I don’t think so,” said the prince, thoughtfully; “it’s too late
for that--that would be dangerous now."
"No, no!"
"Better say nothing about
it."
"Be nice with him, you know, but don’t show him--oh, _you_ know well
enough--”

“I know, prince, of course I know, but I’m afraid I shall not carry
it out; for to do so one needs a heart like your own."
"He is so very
irritable just now, and so proud."
"At one moment he will embrace me,
and the next he flies out at me and sneers at me, and then I stick the
lining forward on purpose."
"Well, _au revoir_, prince, I see I am keeping
you, and boring you, too, interfering with your most interesting private
reflections.”

“Now, do be careful!"
"Secrecy, as before!”

“Oh, silence isn’t the word!"
"Softly, softly!”

But in spite of this conclusion to the episode, the prince remained as
puzzled as ever, if not more so."
"He awaited next morning’s interview
with the general most impatiently."
IV.
"The time appointed was twelve o’clock, and the prince, returning home
unexpectedly late, found the general waiting for him."
"At the first
glance, he saw that the latter was displeased, perhaps because he had
been kept waiting."
"The prince apologized, and quickly took a seat."
"He
seemed strangely timid before the general this morning, for some reason,
and felt as though his visitor were some piece of china which he was
afraid of breaking."
"On scrutinizing him, the prince soon saw that the general was quite a
different man from what he had been the day before; he looked like one
who had come to some momentous resolve."
"His calmness, however, was more
apparent than real."
"He was courteous, but there was a suggestion of
injured innocence in his manner."
"“I’ve brought your book back,” he began, indicating a book lying on the
table."
"“Much obliged to you for lending it to me.”

“Ah, yes."
"Well, did you read it, general?"
"It’s curious, isn’t it?” said
the prince, delighted to be able to open up conversation upon an outside
subject."
"“Curious enough, yes, but crude, and of course dreadful nonsense;
probably the man lies in every other sentence.”

The general spoke with considerable confidence, and dragged his words
out with a conceited drawl."
"“Oh, but it’s only the simple tale of an old soldier who saw the French
enter Moscow."
Some of his remarks were wonderfully interesting.
"Remarks
of an eye-witness are always valuable, whoever he be, don’t you think so?”

“Had I been the publisher I should not have printed it."
"As to the
evidence of eye-witnesses, in these days people prefer impudent lies to
the stories of men of worth and long service."
"I know of some notes of
the year 1812, which--I have determined, prince, to leave this house,
Mr. Lebedeff’s house.”

The general looked significantly at his host."
"“Of course you have your own lodging at Pavlofsk at--at your daughter’s
house,” began the prince, quite at a loss what to say."
"He suddenly
recollected that the general had come for advice on a most important
matter, affecting his destiny."
"“At my wife’s; in other words, at my own place, my daughter’s house.”

“I beg your pardon, I--”

“I leave Lebedeff’s house, my dear prince, because I have quarrelled
with this person."
"I broke with him last night, and am very sorry that I
did not do so before."
"I expect respect, prince, even from those to whom
I give my heart, so to speak."
"Prince, I have often given away my heart,
and am nearly always deceived."
"This person was quite unworthy of the
gift.”

“There is much that might be improved in him,” said the prince,
moderately, “but he has some qualities which--though amid them one
cannot but discern a cunning nature--reveal what is often a diverting
intellect.”

The prince’s tone was so natural and respectful that the general could
not possibly suspect him of any insincerity."
"“Oh, that he possesses good traits, I was the first to show, when I very
nearly made him a present of my friendship."
"I am not dependent upon his
hospitality, and upon his house; I have my own family."
"I do not attempt
to justify my own weakness."
"I have drunk with this man, and perhaps I
deplore the fact now, but I did not take him up for the sake of drink
alone (excuse the crudeness of the expression, prince); I did not make
friends with him for that alone."
"I was attracted by his good qualities;
but when the fellow declares that he was a child in 1812, and had his
left leg cut off, and buried in the Vagarkoff cemetery, in Moscow,
such a cock-and-bull story amounts to disrespect, my dear sir, to--to
impudent exaggeration.”

“Oh, he was very likely joking; he said it for fun.”

“I quite understand you."
"You mean that an innocent lie for the sake of a
good joke is harmless, and does not offend the human heart."
"Some people
lie, if you like to put it so, out of pure friendship, in order to amuse
their fellows; but when a man makes use of extravagance in order to show
his disrespect and to make clear how the intimacy bores him, it is time
for a man of honour to break off the said intimacy, and to teach the
offender his place.”

The general flushed with indignation as he spoke."
"“Oh, but Lebedeff cannot have been in Moscow in 1812."
"He is much too
young; it is all nonsense.”

“Very well, but even if we admit that he _was_ alive in 1812, can one
believe that a French chasseur pointed a cannon at him for a lark, and
shot his left leg off?"
"He says he picked his own leg up and took it away
and buried it in the cemetery."
"He swore he had a stone put up over
it with the inscription: ‘Here lies the leg of Collegiate Secretary
Lebedeff,’ and on the other side, ‘Rest, beloved ashes, till the morn of
joy,’ and that he has a service read over it every year (which is simply
sacrilege), and goes to Moscow once a year on purpose."
"He invites me to
Moscow in order to prove his assertion, and show me his leg’s tomb, and
the very cannon that shot him; he says it’s the eleventh from the
gate of the Kremlin, an old-fashioned falconet taken from the French
afterwards.”

“And, meanwhile both his legs are still on his body,” said the prince,
laughing."
"“I assure you, it is only an innocent joke, and you need not
be angry about it.”

“Excuse me--wait a minute--he says that the leg we see is a wooden one,
made by Tchernosvitoff.”

“They do say one can dance with those!”

“Quite so, quite so; and he swears that his wife never found out that
one of his legs was wooden all the while they were married."
"When I
showed him the ridiculousness of all this, he said, ‘Well, if you were
one of Napoleon’s pages in 1812, you might let me bury my leg in the
Moscow cemetery.’ ”

“Why, did you say--” began the prince, and paused in confusion."
The general gazed at his host disdainfully.
"“Oh, go on,” he said, “finish your sentence, by all means."
"Say how odd
it appears to you that a man fallen to such a depth of humiliation as
I, can ever have been the actual eye-witness of great events."
"Go on, _I_
don’t mind!"
"Has _he_ found time to tell you scandal about me?”

“No, I’ve heard nothing of this from Lebedeff, if you mean Lebedeff.”

“H’m; I thought differently."
"You see, we were talking over this period
of history."
"I was criticizing a current report of something which then
happened, and having been myself an eye-witness of the occurrence--you
are smiling, prince--you are looking at my face as if--”

“Oh no!"
"not at all--I--”

“I am rather young-looking, I know; but I am actually older than I
appear to be."
I was ten or eleven in the year 1812.
"I don’t know my age
exactly, but it has always been a weakness of mine to make it out less
than it really is.”

“I assure you, general, I do not in the least doubt your statement."
"One
of our living autobiographers states that when he was a small baby in
Moscow in 1812 the French soldiers fed him with bread.”

“Well, there you see!” said the general, condescendingly."
"“There is
nothing whatever unusual about my tale."
"Truth very often appears to
be impossible."
"I was a page--it sounds strange, I dare say."
"Had I been
fifteen years old I should probably have been terribly frightened
when the French arrived, as my mother was (who had been too slow about
clearing out of Moscow); but as I was only just ten I was not in the
least alarmed, and rushed through the crowd to the very door of the
palace when Napoleon alighted from his horse.”

“Undoubtedly, at ten years old you would not have felt the sense of
fear, as you say,” blurted out the prince, horribly uncomfortable in the
sensation that he was just about to blush."
“Of course; and it all happened so easily and naturally.
"And yet, were
a novelist to describe the episode, he would put in all kinds of
impossible and incredible details.”

“Oh,” cried the prince, “I have often thought that!"
"Why, I know of a
murder, for the sake of a watch."
It’s in all the papers now.
"But if
some writer had invented it, all the critics would have jumped down his
throat and said the thing was too improbable for anything."
"And yet you
read it in the paper, and you can’t help thinking that out of these
strange disclosures is to be gained the full knowledge of Russian life
and character."
"You said that well, general; it is so true,” concluded
the prince, warmly, delighted to have found a refuge from the fiery
blushes which had covered his face."
"“Yes, it’s quite true, isn’t it?” cried the general, his eyes sparkling
with gratification."
"“A small boy, a child, would naturally realize no
danger; he would shove his way through the crowds to see the shine and
glitter of the uniforms, and especially the great man of whom everyone
was speaking, for at that time all the world had been talking of no one
but this man for some years past."
"The world was full of his name; I--so
to speak--drew it in with my mother’s milk."
"Napoleon, passing a couple
of paces from me, caught sight of me accidentally."
"I was very well
dressed, and being all alone, in that crowd, as you will easily
imagine...”

“Oh, of course!"
"Naturally the sight impressed him, and proved to him
that not _all_ the aristocracy had left Moscow; that at least some nobles
and their children had remained behind.”

“Just so!"
just so!
He wanted to win over the aristocracy!
"When his eagle
eye fell on me, mine probably flashed back in response."
"‘_Voilà un garçon
bien éveillé!"
"Qui est ton père?_’ I immediately replied, almost panting
with excitement, ‘A general, who died on the battle-fields of his country!’
‘_Le fils d’un boyard et d’un brave, pardessus le marché."
"J’aime
les boyards."
"M’aimes-tu, petit?_’

“To this keen question I replied as keenly, ‘The Russian heart can
recognize a great man even in the bitter enemy of his country.’ At
least, I don’t remember the exact words, you know, but the idea was
as I say."
"Napoleon was struck; he thought a minute and then said to
his suite: ‘I like that boy’s pride; if all Russians think like this
child, then--’ he didn’t finish, but went on and entered the palace."
"I instantly mixed with his suite, and followed him."
"I was already in
high favour."
"I remember when he came into the first hall, the emperor
stopped before a portrait of the Empress Katherine, and after a
thoughtful glance remarked, ‘That was a great woman,’ and passed on."
"“Well, in a couple of days I was known all over the palace and the
Kremlin as ‘le petit boyard.’ I only went home to sleep."
"They were
nearly out of their minds about me at home."
"A couple of days after this,
Napoleon’s page, De Bazancour, died; he had not been able to stand the
trials of the campaign."
"Napoleon remembered me; I was taken away without
explanation; the dead page’s uniform was tried on me, and when I was
taken before the emperor, dressed in it, he nodded his head to me, and I
was told that I was appointed to the vacant post of page."
"“Well, I was glad enough, for I had long felt the greatest sympathy for
this man; and then the pretty uniform and all that--only a child, you
know--and so on."
"It was a dark green dress coat with gold buttons--red
facings, white trousers, and a white silk waistcoat--silk stockings,
shoes with buckles, and top-boots if I were riding out with his majesty
or with the suite."
"“Though the position of all of us at that time was not particularly
brilliant, and the poverty was dreadful all round, yet the etiquette at
court was strictly preserved, and the more strictly in proportion to the
growth of the forebodings of disaster.”

“Quite so, quite so, of course!” murmured the poor prince, who didn’t
know where to look."
"“Your memoirs would be most interesting.”

The general was, of course, repeating what he had told Lebedeff the
night before, and thus brought it out glibly enough, but here he looked
suspiciously at the prince out of the corners of his eyes."
"“My memoirs!” he began, with redoubled pride and dignity."
"“Write my
memoirs?"
The idea has not tempted me.
"And yet, if you please, my memoirs
have long been written, but they shall not see the light until dust
returns to dust."
"Then, I doubt not, they will be translated into all
languages, not of course on account of their actual literary merit, but
because of the great events of which I was the actual witness, though
but a child at the time."
"As a child, I was able to penetrate into the
secrecy of the great man’s private room."
"At nights I have heard the
groans and wailings of this ‘giant in distress.’ He could feel no shame
in weeping before such a mere child as I was, though I understood even
then that the reason for his suffering was the silence of the Emperor
Alexander.”

“Yes, of course; he had written letters to the latter with proposals of
peace, had he not?” put in the prince."
"“We did not know the details of his proposals, but he wrote letter after
letter, all day and every day."
He was dreadfully agitated.
"Sometimes at
night I would throw myself upon his breast with tears (Oh, how I
loved that man!)."
"‘Ask forgiveness, Oh, ask forgiveness of the Emperor
Alexander!’ I would cry."
"I should have said, of course, ‘Make peace
with Alexander,’ but as a child I expressed my idea in the naive way
recorded."
"‘Oh, my child,’ he would say (he loved to talk to me and
seemed to forget my tender years), ‘Oh, my child, I am ready to kiss
Alexander’s feet, but I hate and abominate the King of Prussia and the
Austrian Emperor, and--and--but you know nothing of politics, my child.’
He would pull up, remembering whom he was speaking to, but his eyes
would sparkle for a long while after this."
"Well now, if I were to
describe all this, and I have seen greater events than these, all these
critical gentlemen of the press and political parties--Oh, no thanks!"
"I’m their very humble servant, but no thanks!”

“Quite so--parties--you are very right,” said the prince."
"“I was reading
a book about Napoleon and the Waterloo campaign only the other day, by
Charasse, in which the author does not attempt to conceal his joy at
Napoleon’s discomfiture at every page."
"Well now, I don’t like that;
it smells of ‘party,’ you know."
You are quite right.
"And were you much
occupied with your service under Napoleon?”

The general was in ecstasies, for the prince’s remarks, made, as they
evidently were, in all seriousness and simplicity, quite dissipated the
last relics of his suspicion."
“I know Charasse’s book!
Oh!
I was so angry with his work!
"I wrote to
him and said--I forget what, at this moment."
"You ask whether I was very
busy under the Emperor?"
Oh no!
"I was called ‘page,’ but hardly took my
duty seriously."
"Besides, Napoleon very soon lost hope of conciliating
the Russians, and he would have forgotten all about me had he not loved
me--for personal reasons--I don’t mind saying so now."
"My heart was
greatly drawn to him, too."
My duties were light.
"I merely had to be at
the palace occasionally to escort the Emperor out riding, and that
was about all."
I rode very fairly well.
"He used to have a ride before
dinner, and his suite on those occasions were generally Davoust, myself,
and Roustan.”

“Constant?” said the prince, suddenly, and quite involuntarily."
"“No; Constant was away then, taking a letter to the Empress Josephine."
"Instead of him there were always a couple of orderlies--and that was
all, excepting, of course, the generals and marshals whom Napoleon
always took with him for the inspection of various localities, and
for the sake of consultation generally."
"I remember there was
one--Davoust--nearly always with him--a big man with spectacles."
"They
used to argue and quarrel sometimes."
"Once they were in the Emperor’s
study together--just those two and myself--I was unobserved--and
they argued, and the Emperor seemed to be agreeing to something under
protest."
"Suddenly his eye fell on me and an idea seemed to flash across
him."
"“‘Child,’ he said, abruptly."
"‘If I were to recognize the Russian
orthodox religion and emancipate the serfs, do you think Russia would
come over to me?’”

“‘Never!’ I cried, indignantly.”

“The Emperor was much struck.”

“‘In the flashing eyes of this patriotic child I read and accept the
fiat of the Russian people."
"Enough, Davoust, it is mere phantasy on our
part."
"Come, let’s hear your other project.’”

“Yes, but that was a great idea,” said the prince, clearly interested."
"“You ascribe it to Davoust, do you?”

“Well, at all events, they were consulting together at the time."
"Of
course it was the idea of an eagle, and must have originated with
Napoleon; but the other project was good too--it was the ‘Conseil du
lion!’ as Napoleon called it."
"This project consisted in a proposal
to occupy the Kremlin with the whole army; to arm and fortify it
scientifically, to kill as many horses as could be got, and salt their
flesh, and spend the winter there; and in spring to fight their way out."
Napoleon liked the idea--it attracted him.
"We rode round the Kremlin
walls every day, and Napoleon used to give orders where they were to be
patched, where built up, where pulled down and so on."
"All was decided at
last."
They were alone together--those two and myself.
“Napoleon was walking up and down with folded arms.
"I could not take my
eyes off his face--my heart beat loudly and painfully."
"“‘I’m off,’ said Davoust."
‘Where to?’ asked Napoleon.
"“‘To salt horse-flesh,’ said Davoust."
"Napoleon shuddered--his fate was
being decided."
"“‘Child,’ he addressed me suddenly, ‘what do you think of our plan?’ Of
course he only applied to me as a sort of toss-up, you know."
"I turned to
Davoust and addressed my reply to him."
"I said, as though inspired:

“‘Escape, general!"
"Go home!--’

“The project was abandoned; Davoust shrugged his shoulders and went out,
whispering to himself--‘_Bah, il devient superstitieux!_’ Next morning the
order to retreat was given.”

“All this is most interesting,” said the prince, very softly, “if it
really was so--that is, I mean--” he hastened to correct himself."
"“Oh, my dear prince,” cried the general, who was now so intoxicated with
his own narrative that he probably could not have pulled up at the
most patent indiscretion."
"“You say, ‘if it really was so!’ There was
more--_much_ more, I assure you!"
"These are merely a few little political
acts."
"I tell you I was the eye-witness of the nightly sorrow and
groanings of the great man, and of _that_ no one can speak but myself."
"Towards the end he wept no more, though he continued to emit an
occasional groan; but his face grew more overcast day by day, as
though Eternity were wrapping its gloomy mantle about him."
"Occasionally
we passed whole hours of silence together at night, Roustan snoring
in the next room--that fellow slept like a pig."
"‘But he’s loyal to me
and my dynasty,’ said Napoleon of him."
"“Sometimes it was very painful to me, and once he caught me with tears
in my eyes."
He looked at me kindly.
"‘You are sorry for me,’ he said,
‘you, my child, and perhaps one other child--my son, the King of
Rome--may grieve for me."
"All the rest hate me; and my brothers are the
first to betray me in misfortune.’ I sobbed and threw myself into his
arms."
"He could not resist me--he burst into tears, and our tears mingled
as we folded each other in a close embrace."
"“‘Write, oh, write a letter to the Empress Josephine!’ I cried, sobbing."
"Napoleon started, reflected, and said, ‘You remind me of a third heart
which loves me."
"Thank you, my friend;’ and then and there he sat down
and wrote that letter to Josephine, with which Constant was sent off
next day.”

“You did a good action,” said the prince, “for in the midst of his angry
feelings you insinuated a kind thought into his heart.”

“Just so, prince, just so."
How well you bring out that fact!
"Because
your own heart is good!” cried the ecstatic old gentleman, and,
strangely enough, real tears glistened in his eyes."
"“Yes, prince, it was
a wonderful spectacle."
"And, do you know, I all but went off to Paris,
and should assuredly have shared his solitary exile with him; but, alas,
our destinies were otherwise ordered!"
"We parted, he to his island,
where I am sure he thought of the weeping child who had embraced him
so affectionately at parting in Moscow; and I was sent off to the cadet
corps, where I found nothing but roughness and harsh discipline."
"Alas,
my happy days were done!”

“‘I do not wish to deprive your mother of you, and, therefore, I will
not ask you to go with me,’ he said, the morning of his departure, ‘but
I should like to do something for you.’ He was mounting his horse as
he spoke."
"‘Write something in my sister’s album for me,’ I said rather
timidly, for he was in a state of great dejection at the moment."
"He
turned, called for a pen, took the album."
"‘How old is your sister?’
he asked, holding the pen in his hand."
"‘Three years old,’ I said."
"‘Ah,
_petite fille alors!_’ and he wrote in the album:

  “‘Ne mentez jamais!"
"NAPOLÉON (votre ami sincère).’

“Such advice, and at such a moment, you must allow, prince, was--”

“Yes, quite so; very remarkable.”

“This page of the album, framed in gold, hung on the wall of my sister’s
drawing-room all her life, in the most conspicuous place, till the day
of her death; where it is now, I really don’t know."
Heavens!
"it’s two
o’clock!"
"_How_ I have kept you, prince!"
"It is really most unpardonable of
me.”

The general rose."
"“Oh, not in the least,” said the prince."
"“On the contrary, I have been
so much interested, I’m really very much obliged to you.”

“Prince,” said the general, pressing his hand, and looking at him with
flashing eyes, and an expression as though he were under the influence
of a sudden thought which had come upon him with stunning force."
"“Prince, you are so kind, so simple-minded, that sometimes I really
feel sorry for you!"
I gaze at you with a feeling of real affection.
"Oh,
Heaven bless you!"
May your life blossom and fructify in love.
"Mine is
over."
"Forgive me, forgive me!”

He left the room quickly, covering his face with his hands."
The prince could not doubt the sincerity of his agitation.
"He
understood, too, that the old man had left the room intoxicated with his
own success."
"The general belonged to that class of liars, who, in spite
of their transports of lying, invariably suspect that they are not
believed."
"On this occasion, when he recovered from his exaltation, he
would probably suspect Muishkin of pitying him, and feel insulted."
"“Have I been acting rightly in allowing him to develop such vast
resources of imagination?” the prince asked himself."
"But his answer was
a fit of violent laughter which lasted ten whole minutes."
"He tried to
reproach himself for the laughing fit, but eventually concluded that he
needn’t do so, since in spite of it he was truly sorry for the old man."
"The same evening he received a strange letter, short but decided."
"The
general informed him that they must part for ever; that he was grateful,
but that even from him he could not accept “signs of sympathy which were
humiliating to the dignity of a man already miserable enough.”

When the prince heard that the old man had gone to Nina Alexandrovna,
though, he felt almost easy on his account."
"We have seen, however, that the general paid a visit to Lizabetha
Prokofievna and caused trouble there, the final upshot being that he
frightened Mrs. Epanchin, and angered her by bitter hints as to his son
Gania."
"He had been turned out in disgrace, eventually, and this was the
cause of his bad night and quarrelsome day, which ended in his sudden
departure into the street in a condition approaching insanity, as
recorded before."
Colia did not understand the position.
"He tried severity with his
father, as they stood in the street after the latter had cursed the
household, hoping to bring him round that way."
"“Well, where are we to go to now, father?” he asked."
"“You don’t want
to go to the prince’s; you have quarrelled with Lebedeff; you have no
money; I never have any; and here we are in the middle of the road, in a
nice sort of mess.”

“Better to be of a mess than in a mess!"
"I remember making a joke
something like that at the mess in eighteen hundred and forty--forty--I
forget."
"‘Where is my youth, where is my golden youth?’ Who was it said
that, Colia?”

“It was Gogol, in Dead Souls, father,” cried Colia, glancing at him in
some alarm."
"“‘Dead Souls,’ yes, of course, dead."
"When I die, Colia, you must engrave
on my tomb:

  “‘Here lies a Dead Soul,
    Shame pursues me.’

“Who said that, Colia?”

“I don’t know, father.”

“There was no Eropegoff?"
"Eroshka Eropegoff?” he cried, suddenly,
stopping in the road in a frenzy."
“No Eropegoff!
"And my own son to say
it!"
Eropegoff was in the place of a brother to me for eleven months.
"I
fought a duel for him."
"He was married afterwards, and then killed on the
field of battle."
"The bullet struck the cross on my breast and glanced
off straight into his temple."
"‘I’ll never forget you,’ he cried, and
expired."
"I served my country well and honestly, Colia, but shame, shame
has pursued me!"
"You and Nina will come to my grave, Colia; poor Nina,
I always used to call her Nina in the old days, and how she loved....
Nina, Nina, oh, Nina."
"What have I ever done to deserve your forgiveness
and long-suffering?"
"Oh, Colia, your mother has an angelic spirit, an
angelic spirit, Colia!”

“I know that, father."
"Look here, dear old father, come back home!"
"Let’s
go back to mother."
"Look, she ran after us when we came out."
"What have
you stopped her for, just as though you didn’t take in what I said?"
"Why
are you crying, father?”

Poor Colia cried himself, and kissed the old man’s hands

“You kiss my hands, _mine?_”

“Yes, yes, yours, yours!"
What is there to surprise anyone in that?
"Come,
come, you mustn’t go on like this, crying in the middle of the road; and
you a general too, a military man!"
"Come, let’s go back.”

“God bless you, dear boy, for being respectful to a disgraced man."
"Yes,
to a poor disgraced old fellow, your father."
"You shall have such a son
yourself; le roi de Rome."
"Oh, curses on this house!”

“Come, come, what does all this mean?” cried Colia beside himself at
last."
“What is it?
What has happened to you?
"Why don’t you wish to come
back home?"
"Why have you gone out of your mind, like this?”

“I’ll explain it, I’ll explain all to you."
Don’t shout!
You shall hear.
Le roi de Rome.
"Oh, I am sad, I am melancholy!"
"“‘Nurse, where is your tomb?’

“Who said that, Colia?”

“I don’t know, I don’t know who said it."
Come home at once; come on!
"I’ll punch Gania’s head myself, if you like--only come."
"Oh, where _are_
you off to again?” The general was dragging him away towards the door of
a house nearby."
"He sat down on the step, still holding Colia by the hand."
“Bend down--bend down your ear.
"I’ll tell you all--disgrace--bend down,
I’ll tell you in your ear.”

“What are you dreaming of?” said poor, frightened Colia, stooping down
towards the old man, all the same."
"“Le roi de Rome,” whispered the general, trembling all over."
“What?
What _do_ you mean?
"What roi de Rome?”

“I--I,” the general continued to whisper, clinging more and more
tightly to the boy’s shoulder."
"“I--wish--to tell you--all--Maria--Maria
Petrovna--Su--Su--Su.......”

Colia broke loose, seized his father by the shoulders, and stared into
his eyes with frenzied gaze."
"The old man had grown livid--his lips were
shaking, convulsions were passing over his features."
"Suddenly he leant
over and began to sink slowly into Colia’s arms."
"“He’s got a stroke!” cried Colia, loudly, realizing what was the matter
at last."
"V.

In point of fact, Varia had rather exaggerated the certainty of her
news as to the prince’s betrothal to Aglaya."
"Very likely, with the
perspicacity of her sex, she gave out as an accomplished fact what she
felt was pretty sure to become a fact in a few days."
"Perhaps she could
not resist the satisfaction of pouring one last drop of bitterness into
her brother Gania’s cup, in spite of her love for him."
"At all events,
she had been unable to obtain any definite news from the Epanchin
girls--the most she could get out of them being hints and surmises, and
so on."
"Perhaps Aglaya’s sisters had merely been pumping Varia for news
while pretending to impart information; or perhaps, again, they had been
unable to resist the feminine gratification of teasing a friend--for,
after all this time, they could scarcely have helped divining the aim of
her frequent visits."
"On the other hand, the prince, although he had told Lebedeff,--as we
know, that nothing had happened, and that he had nothing to impart,--the
prince may have been in error."
"Something strange seemed to have
happened, without anything definite having actually happened."
"Varia had
guessed that with her true feminine instinct."
"How or why it came about that everyone at the Epanchins’ became imbued
with one conviction--that something very important had happened to
Aglaya, and that her fate was in process of settlement--it would be very
difficult to explain."
"But no sooner had this idea taken root, than all
at once declared that they had seen and observed it long ago; that they
had remarked it at the time of the “poor knight” joke, and even before,
though they had been unwilling to believe in such nonsense."
So said the sisters.
"Of course, Lizabetha Prokofievna had foreseen it
long before the rest; her “heart had been sore” for a long while,
she declared, and it was now so sore that she appeared to be quite
overwhelmed, and the very thought of the prince became distasteful to
her."
"There was a question to be decided--most important, but most difficult;
so much so, that Mrs. Epanchin did not even see how to put it into
words."
Would the prince do or not?
Was all this good or bad?
"If good
(which might be the case, of course), _why_ good?"
"If bad (which was
hardly doubtful), _wherein_, especially, bad?"
"Even the general, the
paterfamilias, though astonished at first, suddenly declared that, “upon
his honour, he really believed he had fancied something of the kind,
after all."
"At first, it seemed a new idea, and then, somehow, it looked
as familiar as possible.” His wife frowned him down there."
"This was
in the morning; but in the evening, alone with his wife, he had given
tongue again."
"“Well, really, you know”--(silence)--“of course, you know all this is
very strange, if true, which I cannot deny; but”--(silence).--“But,
on the other hand, if one looks things in the face, you know--upon my
honour, the prince is a rare good fellow--and--and--and--well, his name,
you know--your family name--all this looks well, and perpetuates the
name and title and all that--which at this moment is not standing so
high as it might--from one point of view--don’t you know?"
"The world,
the world is the world, of course--and people will talk--and--and--the
prince has property, you know--if it is not very large--and then
he--he--” (Continued silence, and collapse of the general.)"
"Hearing these words from her husband, Lizabetha Prokofievna was driven
beside herself."
"According to her opinion, the whole thing had been one huge,
fantastical, absurd, unpardonable mistake."
"“First of all, this prince is
an idiot, and, secondly, he is a fool--knows nothing of the world, and
has no place in it."
Whom can he be shown to?
Where can you take him to?
What will old Bielokonski say?
"We never thought of such a husband as
_that_ for our Aglaya!”

Of course, the last argument was the chief one."
"The maternal heart
trembled with indignation to think of such an absurdity, although in
that heart there rose another voice, which said: “And _why_ is not the
prince such a husband as you would have desired for Aglaya?” It was this
voice which annoyed Lizabetha Prokofievna more than anything else."
"For some reason or other, the sisters liked the idea of the prince."
"They
did not even consider it very strange; in a word, they might be expected
at any moment to range themselves strongly on his side."
"But both of them
decided to say nothing either way."
"It had always been noticed in the
family that the stronger Mrs. Epanchin’s opposition was to any project,
the nearer she was, in reality, to giving in."
"Alexandra, however, found it difficult to keep absolute silence on
the subject."
"Long since holding, as she did, the post of “confidential
adviser to mamma,” she was now perpetually called in council, and asked
her opinion, and especially her assistance, in order to recollect “how
on earth all this happened?” Why did no one see it?"
"Why did no one say
anything about it?"
What did all that wretched “poor knight” joke mean?
"Why was she, Lizabetha Prokofievna, driven to think, and foresee, and
worry for everybody, while they all sucked their thumbs, and counted the
crows in the garden, and did nothing?"
"At first, Alexandra had been very
careful, and had merely replied that perhaps her father’s remark was not
so far out: that, in the eyes of the world, probably the choice of the
prince as a husband for one of the Epanchin girls would be considered a
very wise one."
"Warming up, however, she added that the prince was by no
means a fool, and never had been; and that as to “place in the world,”
 no one knew what the position of a respectable person in Russia would
imply in a few years--whether it would depend on successes in the
government service, on the old system, or what."
"To all this her mother replied that Alexandra was a freethinker, and
that all this was due to that “cursed woman’s rights question.”

Half an hour after this conversation, she went off to town, and thence
to the Kammenny Ostrof, [“Stone Island,” a suburb and park of St.
Petersburg] to see Princess Bielokonski, who had just arrived from
Moscow on a short visit."
The princess was Aglaya’s godmother.
"“Old Bielokonski” listened to all the fevered and despairing lamentations
of Lizabetha Prokofievna without the least emotion; the tears of this
sorrowful mother did not evoke answering sighs--in fact, she laughed at
her."
"She was a dreadful old despot, this princess; she could not allow
equality in anything, not even in friendship of the oldest standing, and
she insisted on treating Mrs. Epanchin as her _protégée_, as she had been
thirty-five years ago."
"She could never put up with the independence and
energy of Lizabetha’s character."
"She observed that, as usual, the whole
family had gone much too far ahead, and had converted a fly into an
elephant; that, so far as she had heard their story, she was persuaded
that nothing of any seriousness had occurred; that it would surely
be better to wait until something _did_ happen; that the prince, in
her opinion, was a very decent young fellow, though perhaps a little
eccentric, through illness, and not quite as weighty in the world as one
could wish."
"The worst feature was, she said, Nastasia Philipovna."
"Lizabetha Prokofievna well understood that the old lady was angry at the
failure of Evgenie Pavlovitch--her own recommendation."
"She returned
home to Pavlofsk in a worse humour than when she left, and of course
everybody in the house suffered."
"She pitched into everyone, because, she
declared, they had ‘gone mad.’ Why were things always mismanaged in her
house?"
Why had everybody been in such a frantic hurry in this matter?
"So far as she could see, nothing whatever had happened."
"Surely they had
better wait and see what was to happen, instead of making mountains out
of molehills."
"And so the conclusion of the matter was that it would be far better to
take it quietly, and wait coolly to see what would turn up."
"But, alas!"
peace did not reign for more than ten minutes.
"The first blow dealt to
its power was in certain news communicated to Lizabetha Prokofievna as
to events which had happened during her trip to see the princess."
"(This
trip had taken place the day after that on which the prince had turned
up at the Epanchins at nearly one o’clock at night, thinking it was
nine.)"
"The sisters replied candidly and fully enough to their mother’s
impatient questions on her return."
"They said, in the first place, that
nothing particular had happened since her departure; that the prince
had been, and that Aglaya had kept him waiting a long while before
she appeared--half an hour, at least; that she had then come in, and
immediately asked the prince to have a game of chess; that the prince
did not know the game, and Aglaya had beaten him easily; that she had
been in a wonderfully merry mood, and had laughed at the prince, and
chaffed him so unmercifully that one was quite sorry to see his wretched
expression."
"She had then asked him to play cards--the game called “little fools.”
 At this game the tables were turned completely, for the prince had shown
himself a master at it."
"Aglaya had cheated and changed cards, and stolen
others, in the most bare-faced way, but, in spite of everything the
prince had beaten her hopelessly five times running, and she had been
left “little fool” each time."
"Aglaya then lost her temper, and began to say such awful things to the
prince that he laughed no more, but grew dreadfully pale, especially
when she said that she should not remain in the house with him, and that
he ought to be ashamed of coming to their house at all, especially at
night, “_after all that had happened._”

So saying, she had left the room, banging the door after her, and the
prince went off, looking as though he were on his way to a funeral, in
spite of all their attempts at consolation."
"Suddenly, a quarter of an hour after the prince’s departure, Aglaya had
rushed out of her room in such a hurry that she had not even wiped her
eyes, which were full of tears."
"She came back because Colia had brought
a hedgehog."
Everybody came in to see the hedgehog.
"In answer to their
questions Colia explained that the hedgehog was not his, and that he had
left another boy, Kostia Lebedeff, waiting for him outside."
"Kostia was
too shy to come in, because he was carrying a hatchet; they had bought
the hedgehog and the hatchet from a peasant whom they had met on the
road."
"He had offered to sell them the hedgehog, and they had paid fifty
copecks for it; and the hatchet had so taken their fancy that they had
made up their minds to buy it of their own accord."
"On hearing this,
Aglaya urged Colia to sell her the hedgehog; she even called him “dear
Colia,” in trying to coax him."
"He refused for a long time, but at last
he could hold out no more, and went to fetch Kostia Lebedeff."
"The latter
appeared, carrying his hatchet, and covered with confusion."
"Then it came
out that the hedgehog was not theirs, but the property of a schoolmate,
one Petroff, who had given them some money to buy Schlosser’s History
for him, from another schoolfellow who at that moment was driven to
raising money by the sale of his books."
"Colia and Kostia were about to
make this purchase for their friend when chance brought the hedgehog
to their notice, and they had succumbed to the temptation of buying it."
"They were now taking Petroff the hedgehog and hatchet which they had
bought with his money, instead of Schlosser’s History."
"But Aglaya so
entreated them that at last they consented to sell her the hedgehog."
"As
soon as she had got possession of it, she put it in a wicker basket with
Colia’s help, and covered it with a napkin."
"Then she said to Colia: “Go
and take this hedgehog to the prince from me, and ask him to accept it
as a token of my profound respect.” Colia joyfully promised to do the
errand, but he demanded explanations."
“What does the hedgehog mean?
"What
is the meaning of such a present?” Aglaya replied that it was none of
his business."
"“I am sure that there is some allegory about it,” Colia
persisted."
"Aglaya grew angry, and called him “a silly boy.” “If I did
not respect all women in your person,” replied Colia, “and if my own
principles would permit it, I would soon prove to you, that I know how
to answer such an insult!” But, in the end, Colia went off with the
hedgehog in great delight, followed by Kostia Lebedeff."
"Aglaya’s
annoyance was soon over, and seeing that Colia was swinging the
hedgehog’s basket violently to and fro, she called out to him from the
verandah, as if they had never quarrelled: “Colia, dear, please take
care not to drop him!” Colia appeared to have no grudge against her,
either, for he stopped, and answered most cordially: “No, I will not
drop him!"
"Don’t be afraid, Aglaya Ivanovna!” After which he went on his
way."
"Aglaya burst out laughing and ran up to her room, highly delighted."
Her good spirits lasted the whole day.
All this filled poor Lizabetha’s mind with chaotic confusion.
"What on
earth did it all mean?"
The most disturbing feature was the hedgehog.
What was the symbolic signification of a hedgehog?
"What did they
understand by it?"
What underlay it?
Was it a cryptic message?
"Poor General Epanchin “put his foot in it” by answering the above
questions in his own way."
"He said there was no cryptic message at
all."
"As for the hedgehog, it was just a hedgehog, which meant
nothing--unless, indeed, it was a pledge of friendship,--the sign of
forgetting of offences and so on."
"At all events, it was a joke, and, of
course, a most pardonable and innocent one."
We may as well remark that the general had guessed perfectly accurately.
"The prince, returning home from the interview with Aglaya, had sat
gloomy and depressed for half an hour."
"He was almost in despair when
Colia arrived with the hedgehog."
Then the sky cleared in a moment.
"The prince seemed to arise from the
dead; he asked Colia all about it, made him repeat the story over and
over again, and laughed and shook hands with the boys in his delight."
"It seemed clear to the prince that Aglaya forgave him, and that he might
go there again this very evening; and in his eyes that was not only the
main thing, but everything in the world."
"“What children we are still, Colia!” he cried at last,
enthusiastically,--“and how delightful it is that we can be children
still!”

“Simply--my dear prince,--simply she is in love with you,--that’s the
whole of the secret!” replied Colia, with authority."
"The prince blushed, but this time he said nothing."
"Colia burst out
laughing and clapped his hands."
"A minute later the prince laughed too,
and from this moment until the evening he looked at his watch every
other minute to see how much time he had to wait before evening came."
But the situation was becoming rapidly critical.
"Mrs. Epanchin could bear her suspense no longer, and in spite of the
opposition of husband and daughters, she sent for Aglaya, determined to
get a straightforward answer out of her, once for all."
"“Otherwise,” she observed hysterically, “I shall die before evening.”

It was only now that everyone realized to what a ridiculous dead-lock
the whole matter had been brought."
"Excepting feigned surprise,
indignation, laughter, and jeering--both at the prince and at everyone
who asked her questions,--nothing could be got out of Aglaya."
"Lizabetha Prokofievna went to bed and only rose again in time for tea,
when the prince might be expected."
"She awaited him in trembling agitation; and when he at last arrived she
nearly went off into hysterics."
Muishkin himself came in very timidly.
"He seemed to feel his way, and
looked in each person’s eyes in a questioning way,--for Aglaya was
absent, which fact alarmed him at once."
"This evening there were no strangers present--no one but the immediate
members of the family."
"Prince S. was still in town, occupied with the
affairs of Evgenie Pavlovitch’s uncle."
"“I wish at least _he_ would come and say something!” complained poor
Lizabetha Prokofievna."
The general sat still with a most preoccupied air.
"The sisters were
looking very serious and did not speak a word, and Lizabetha Prokofievna
did not know how to commence the conversation."
"At length she plunged into an energetic and hostile criticism of
railways, and glared at the prince defiantly."
Alas Aglaya still did not come--and the prince was quite lost.
"He had
the greatest difficulty in expressing his opinion that railways were
most useful institutions,--and in the middle of his speech Adelaida
laughed, which threw him into a still worse state of confusion."
"At this moment in marched Aglaya, as calm and collected as could be."
"She gave the prince a ceremonious bow and solemnly took up a
prominent position near the big round table."
"She looked at the prince
questioningly."
"All present realized that the moment for the settlement of perplexities
had arrived."
"“Did you get my hedgehog?” she inquired, firmly and almost angrily."
"“Yes, I got it,” said the prince, blushing."
"“Tell us now, at once, what you made of the present?"
"I must have you
answer this question for mother’s sake; she needs pacifying, and so do
all the rest of the family!”

“Look here, Aglaya--” began the general."
"“This--this is going beyond all limits!” said Lizabetha Prokofievna,
suddenly alarmed."
"“It is not in the least beyond all limits, mamma!” said her daughter,
firmly."
"“I sent the prince a hedgehog this morning, and I wish to hear
his opinion of it."
"Go on, prince.”

“What--what sort of opinion, Aglaya Ivanovna?”

“About the hedgehog.”

“That is--I suppose you wish to know how I received the hedgehog, Aglaya
Ivanovna,--or, I should say, how I regarded your sending him to me?"
"In
that case, I may tell you--in a word--that I--in fact--”

He paused, breathless."
"“Come--you haven’t told us much!” said Aglaya, after waiting some five
seconds."
"“Very well, I am ready to drop the hedgehog, if you like; but
I am anxious to be able to clear up this accumulation of
misunderstandings."
"Allow me to ask you, prince,--I wish to hear from
you, personally--are you making me an offer, or not?”

“Gracious heavens!” exclaimed Lizabetha Prokofievna."
The prince started.
The general stiffened in his chair; the sisters frowned.
"“Don’t deceive me now, prince--tell the truth."
"All these people
persecute me with astounding questions--about you."
"Is there any ground
for all these questions, or not?"
"Come!”

“I have not asked you to marry me yet, Aglaya Ivanovna,” said the
prince, becoming suddenly animated; “but you know yourself how much I
love you and trust you.”

“No--I asked you this--answer this!"
"Do you intend to ask for my hand, or
not?”

“Yes--I do ask for it!” said the prince, more dead than alive now."
There was a general stir in the room.
"“No--no--my dear girl,” began the general."
"“You cannot proceed like
this, Aglaya, if that’s how the matter stands."
It’s impossible.
"Prince,
forgive it, my dear fellow, but--Lizabetha Prokofievna!”--he appealed to
his spouse for help--“you must really--”

“Not I--not I!"
"I retire from all responsibility,” said Lizabetha
Prokofievna, with a wave of the hand."
"“Allow me to speak, please, mamma,” said Aglaya."
"“I think I ought to
have something to say in the matter."
"An important moment of my destiny
is about to be decided”--(this is how Aglaya expressed herself)--“and
I wish to find out how the matter stands, for my own sake, though I am
glad you are all here."
"Allow me to ask you, prince, since you cherish
those intentions, how you consider that you will provide for my
happiness?”

“I--I don’t quite know how to answer your question, Aglaya Ivanovna."
What is there to say to such a question?
"And--and must I answer?”

“I think you are rather overwhelmed and out of breath."
"Have a little
rest, and try to recover yourself."
"Take a glass of water, or--but
they’ll give you some tea directly.”

“I love you, Aglaya Ivanovna,--I love you very much."
"I love only
you--and--please don’t jest about it, for I do love you very much.”

“Well, this matter is important."
"We are not children--we must look into
it thoroughly."
"Now then, kindly tell me--what does your fortune consist
of?”

“No--Aglaya--come, enough of this, you mustn’t behave like this,” said
her father, in dismay."
"“It’s disgraceful,” said Lizabetha Prokofievna in a loud whisper."
“She’s mad--quite!” said Alexandra.
“Fortune--money--do you mean?” asked the prince in some surprise.
"“Just so.”

“I have now--let’s see--I have a hundred and thirty-five thousand
roubles,” said the prince, blushing violently."
"“Is that all, really?” said Aglaya, candidly, without the slightest
show of confusion."
"“However, it’s not so bad, especially if managed with
economy."
"Do you intend to serve?”

“I--I intended to try for a certificate as private tutor.”

“Very good."
That would increase our income nicely.
"Have you any
intention of being a Kammer-junker?”

“A Kammer-junker?"
"I had not thought of it, but--”

But here the two sisters could restrain themselves no longer, and both
of them burst into irrepressible laughter."
"Adelaida had long since detected in Aglaya’s features the gathering
signs of an approaching storm of laughter, which she restrained with
amazing self-control."
"Aglaya looked menacingly at her laughing sisters, but could not contain
herself any longer, and the next minute she too had burst into an
irrepressible, and almost hysterical, fit of mirth."
"At length she jumped
up, and ran out of the room."
“I knew it was all a joke!” cried Adelaida.
"“I felt it ever since--since
the hedgehog.”

“No, no!"
"I cannot allow this,--this is a little too much,” cried
Lizabetha Prokofievna, exploding with rage, and she rose from her seat
and followed Aglaya out of the room as quickly as she could."
The two sisters hurriedly went after her.
The prince and the general were the only two persons left in the room.
"“It’s--it’s really--now could you have imagined anything like it, Lef
Nicolaievitch?” cried the general."
"He was evidently so much agitated
that he hardly knew what he wished to say."
"“Seriously now, seriously I
mean--”

“I only see that Aglaya Ivanovna is laughing at me,” said the poor
prince, sadly."
"“Wait a bit, my boy, I’ll just go--you stay here, you know."
"But do just
explain, if you can, Lef Nicolaievitch, how in the world has all this
come about?"
And what does it all mean?
"You must understand, my dear
fellow; I am a father, you see, and I ought to be allowed to understand
the matter--do explain, I beg you!”

“I love Aglaya Ivanovna--she knows it,--and I think she must have long
known it.”

The general shrugged his shoulders."
"“Strange--it’s strange,” he said, “and you love her very much?”

“Yes, very much.”

“Well--it’s all most strange to me."
"That is--my dear fellow, it is
such a surprise--such a blow--that... You see, it is not your financial
position (though I should not object if you were a bit richer)--I am
thinking of my daughter’s happiness, of course, and the thing is--are
you able to give her the happiness she deserves?"
"And then--is all this
a joke on her part, or is she in earnest?"
"I don’t mean on your side, but
on hers.”

At this moment Alexandra’s voice was heard outside the door, calling out
“Papa!”

“Wait for me here, my boy--will you?"
"Just wait and think it all over,
and I’ll come back directly,” he said hurriedly, and made off with what
looked like the rapidity of alarm in response to Alexandra’s call."
"He found the mother and daughter locked in one another’s arms, mingling
their tears."
These were the tears of joy and peace and reconciliation.
"Aglaya was
kissing her mother’s lips and cheeks and hands; they were hugging each
other in the most ardent way."
"“There, look at her now--Ivan Fedorovitch!"
Here she is--all of her!
"This
is our _real_ Aglaya at last!” said Lizabetha Prokofievna."
"Aglaya raised her happy, tearful face from her mother’s breast, glanced
at her father, and burst out laughing."
"She sprang at him and hugged him
too, and kissed him over and over again."
"She then rushed back to her
mother and hid her face in the maternal bosom, and there indulged in
more tears."
Her mother covered her with a corner of her shawl.
"“Oh, you cruel little girl!"
"How will you treat us all next, I wonder?”
 she said, but she spoke with a ring of joy in her voice, and as though
she breathed at last without the oppression which she had felt so long."
“Cruel?” sobbed Aglaya.
"“Yes, I _am_ cruel, and worthless, and
spoiled--tell father so,--oh, here he is--I forgot Father, listen!” She
laughed through her tears."
"“My darling, my little idol,” cried the general, kissing and fondling
her hands (Aglaya did not draw them away); “so you love this young man,
do you?”

“No, no, no, can’t _bear_ him, I can’t _bear_ your young man!” cried
Aglaya, raising her head."
"“And if you dare say that _once_ more, papa--I’m
serious, you know, I’m,--do you hear me--I’m serious!”

She certainly did seem to be serious enough."
"She had flushed up all over
and her eyes were blazing."
"The general felt troubled and remained silent, while Lizabetha
Prokofievna telegraphed to him from behind Aglaya to ask no questions."
"“If that’s the case, darling--then, of course, you shall do exactly as
you like."
He is waiting alone downstairs.
"Hadn’t I better hint to him
gently that he can go?” The general telegraphed to Lizabetha Prokofievna
in his turn."
"“No, no, you needn’t do anything of the sort; you mustn’t hint gently
at all."
I’ll go down myself directly.
"I wish to apologize to this young
man, because I hurt his feelings.”

“Yes, _seriously_,” said the general, gravely."
"“Well, you’d better stay here, all of you, for a little, and I’ll go
down to him alone to begin with."
"I’ll just go in and then you can follow
me almost at once."
"That’s the best way.”

She had almost reached the door when she turned round again."
"“I shall laugh--I know I shall; I shall die of laughing,” she said,
lugubriously."
"However, she turned and ran down to the prince as fast as her feet could
carry her."
"“Well, what does it all mean?"
"What do you make of it?” asked the general
of his spouse, hurriedly."
"“I hardly dare say,” said Lizabetha, as hurriedly, “but I think it’s as
plain as anything can be.”

“I think so too, as clear as day; she loves him.”

“Loves him?"
"She is head over ears in love, that’s what she is,” put in
Alexandra."
"“Well, God bless her, God bless her, if such is her destiny,” said
Lizabetha, crossing herself devoutly."
"“H’m destiny it is,” said the general, “and there’s no getting out of
destiny.”

With these words they all moved off towards the drawing-room, where
another surprise awaited them."
"Aglaya had not only not laughed, as she
had feared, but had gone to the prince rather timidly, and said to him:

“Forgive a silly, horrid, spoilt girl”--(she took his hand here)--“and
be quite assured that we all of us esteem you beyond all words."
"And if I
dared to turn your beautiful, admirable simplicity to ridicule, forgive
me as you would a little child its mischief."
"Forgive me all my absurdity
of just now, which, of course, meant nothing, and could not have the
slightest consequence.” She spoke these words with great emphasis."
"Her father, mother, and sisters came into the room and were much struck
with the last words, which they just caught as they entered--“absurdity
which of course meant nothing”--and still more so with the emphasis with
which Aglaya had spoken."
"They exchanged glances questioningly, but the prince did not seem to
have understood the meaning of Aglaya’s words; he was in the highest
heaven of delight."
“Why do you speak so?” he murmured.
"“Why do you ask my forgiveness?”

He wished to add that he was unworthy of being asked for forgiveness
by her, but paused."
"Perhaps he did understand Aglaya’s sentence about
“absurdity which meant nothing,” and like the strange fellow that he
was, rejoiced in the words."
"Undoubtedly the fact that he might now come and see Aglaya as much as
he pleased again was quite enough to make him perfectly happy; that he
might come and speak to her, and see her, and sit by her, and walk with
her--who knows, but that all this was quite enough to satisfy him for
the whole of his life, and that he would desire no more to the end of
time?"
"(Lizabetha Prokofievna felt that this might be the case, and she didn’t
like it; though very probably she could not have put the idea into
words.)"
"It would be difficult to describe the animation and high spirits which
distinguished the prince for the rest of the evening."
"He was so happy that “it made one feel happy to look at him,” as
Aglaya’s sisters expressed it afterwards."
"He talked, and told stories
just as he had done once before, and never since, namely on the very
first morning of his acquaintance with the Epanchins, six months ago."
"Since his return to Petersburg from Moscow, he had been remarkably
silent, and had told Prince S. on one occasion, before everyone, that he
did not think himself justified in degrading any thought by his unworthy
words."
"But this evening he did nearly all the talking himself, and told stories
by the dozen, while he answered all questions put to him clearly,
gladly, and with any amount of detail."
"There was nothing, however, of love-making in his talk."
"His ideas were
all of the most serious kind; some were even mystical and profound."
"He aired his own views on various matters, some of his most private
opinions and observations, many of which would have seemed rather funny,
so his hearers agreed afterwards, had they not been so well expressed."
"The general liked serious subjects of conversation; but both he and
Lizabetha Prokofievna felt that they were having a little too much of a
good thing tonight, and as the evening advanced, they both grew more
or less melancholy; but towards night, the prince fell to telling funny
stories, and was always the first to burst out laughing himself, which
he invariably did so joyously and simply that the rest laughed just as
much at him as at his stories."
"As for Aglaya, she hardly said a word all the evening; but she listened
with all her ears to Lef Nicolaievitch’s talk, and scarcely took her
eyes off him."
"“She looked at him, and stared and stared, and hung on every word he
said,” said Lizabetha afterwards, to her husband, “and yet, tell her
that she loves him, and she is furious!”

“What’s to be done?"
"It’s fate,” said the general, shrugging his
shoulders, and, for a long while after, he continued to repeat: “It’s
fate, it’s fate!”

We may add that to a business man like General Epanchin the present
position of affairs was most unsatisfactory."
"He hated the uncertainty in
which they had been, perforce, left."
"However, he decided to say no
more about it, and merely to look on, and take his time and tune from
Lizabetha Prokofievna."
"The happy state in which the family had spent the evening, as just
recorded, was not of very long duration."
"Next day Aglaya quarrelled with
the prince again, and so she continued to behave for the next few days."
"For whole hours at a time she ridiculed and chaffed the wretched man,
and made him almost a laughing-stock."
"It is true that they used to sit in the little summer-house together for
an hour or two at a time, very often, but it was observed that on
these occasions the prince would read the paper, or some book, aloud to
Aglaya."
"“Do you know,” Aglaya said to him once, interrupting the reading, “I’ve
remarked that you are dreadfully badly educated."
"You never know anything
thoroughly, if one asks you; neither anyone’s name, nor dates, nor about
treaties and so on."
"It’s a great pity, you know!”

“I told you I had not had much of an education,” replied the prince."
"“How am I to respect you, if that’s the case?"
Read on now.
No--don’t!
"Stop reading!”

And once more, that same evening, Aglaya mystified them all."
"Prince S.
had returned, and Aglaya was particularly amiable to him, and asked a
great deal after Evgenie Pavlovitch."
(Muishkin had not come in as yet.)
"Suddenly Prince S. hinted something about “a new and approaching
change in the family.” He was led to this remark by a communication
inadvertently made to him by Lizabetha Prokofievna, that Adelaida’s
marriage must be postponed a little longer, in order that the two
weddings might come off together."
It is impossible to describe Aglaya’s irritation.
"She flared up, and
said some indignant words about “all these silly insinuations.”
 She added that “she had no intentions as yet of replacing anybody’s
mistress.”

These words painfully impressed the whole party; but especially her
parents."
"Lizabetha Prokofievna summoned a secret council of two, and
insisted upon the general’s demanding from the prince a full explanation
of his relations with Nastasia Philipovna."
"The general argued that it
was only a whim of Aglaya’s; and that, had not Prince S. unfortunately
made that remark, which had confused the child and made her blush, she
never would have said what she did; and that he was sure Aglaya knew
well that anything she might have heard of the prince and Nastasia
Philipovna was merely the fabrication of malicious tongues, and that
the woman was going to marry Rogojin."
"He insisted that the prince had
nothing whatever to do with Nastasia Philipovna, so far as any liaison
was concerned; and, if the truth were to be told about it, he added,
never had had."
"Meanwhile nothing put the prince out, and he continued to be in the
seventh heaven of bliss."
"Of course he could not fail to observe some
impatience and ill-temper in Aglaya now and then; but he believed in
something else, and nothing could now shake his conviction."
"Besides,
Aglaya’s frowns never lasted long; they disappeared of themselves."
Perhaps he was too easy in his mind.
"So thought Hippolyte, at all
events, who met him in the park one day."
"“Didn’t I tell you the truth now, when I said you were in love?” he
said, coming up to Muishkin of his own accord, and stopping him."
"The prince gave him his hand and congratulated him upon “looking so
well.”

Hippolyte himself seemed to be hopeful about his state of health, as is
often the case with consumptives."
"He had approached the prince with the intention of talking sarcastically
about his happy expression of face, but very soon forgot his intention
and began to talk about himself."
"He began complaining about everything,
disconnectedly and endlessly, as was his wont."
"“You wouldn’t believe,” he concluded, “how irritating they all are
there."
"They are such wretchedly small, vain, egotistical, _commonplace_
people!"
"Would you believe it, they invited me there under the express
condition that I should die quickly, and they are all as wild as
possible with me for not having died yet, and for being, on the
contrary, a good deal better!"
Isn’t it a comedy?
"I don’t mind betting
that you don’t believe me!”

The prince said nothing."
"“I sometimes think of coming over to you again,” said Hippolyte,
carelessly."
"“So you _don’t_ think them capable of inviting a man on
the condition that he is to look sharp and die?”

“I certainly thought they invited you with quite other views.”

“Ho, ho!"
you are not nearly so simple as they try to make you out!
"This
is not the time for it, or I would tell you a thing or two about that
beauty, Gania, and his hopes."
"You are being undermined, pitilessly
undermined, and--and it is really melancholy to see you so calm about
it."
But alas!
"it’s your nature--you can’t help it!”

“My word!"
what a thing to be melancholy about!
"Why, do you think I
should be any happier if I were to feel disturbed about the excavations
you tell me of?”

“It is better to be unhappy and know the worst, than to be happy in a
fool’s paradise!"
"I suppose you don’t believe that you have a rival in
that quarter?”

“Your insinuations as to rivalry are rather cynical, Hippolyte."
"I’m
sorry to say I have no right to answer you!"
"As for Gania, I put it to
you, _can_ any man have a happy mind after passing through what he has had
to suffer?"
I think that is the best way to look at it.
"He will
change yet, he has lots of time before him, and life is rich;
besides--besides...” the prince hesitated."
"“As to being undermined, I
don’t know what in the world you are driving at, Hippolyte."
"I think we
had better drop the subject!”

“Very well, we’ll drop it for a while."
"You can’t look at anything but
in your exalted, generous way."
"You must put out your finger and touch a
thing before you’ll believe it, eh?"
Ha!
ha!
ha!
"I suppose you despise me
dreadfully, prince, eh?"
"What do you think?”

“Why?"
"Because you have suffered more than we have?”

“No; because I am unworthy of my sufferings, if you like!”

“Whoever _can_ suffer is worthy to suffer, I should think."
"Aglaya Ivanovna
wished to see you, after she had read your confession, but--”

“She postponed the pleasure--I see--I quite understand!” said Hippolyte,
hurriedly, as though he wished to banish the subject."
"“I hear--they
tell me--that you read her all that nonsense aloud?"
"Stupid bosh it
was--written in delirium."
"And I can’t understand how anyone can be so--I
won’t say _cruel_, because the word would be humiliating to myself, but
we’ll say childishly vain and revengeful, as to _reproach_ me with this
confession, and use it as a weapon against me."
"Don’t be afraid, I’m not
referring to yourself.”

“Oh, but I’m sorry you repudiate the confession, Hippolyte--it is
sincere; and, do you know, even the absurd parts of it--and these are
many” (here Hippolyte frowned savagely) “are, as it were, redeemed by
suffering--for it must have cost you something to admit what you there
say--great torture, perhaps, for all I know."
"Your motive must have
been a very noble one all through."
"Whatever may have appeared to the
contrary, I give you my word, I see this more plainly every day."
"I do
not judge you; I merely say this to have it off my mind, and I am only
sorry that I did not say it all _then_--”

Hippolyte flushed hotly."
"He had thought at first that the prince
was “humbugging” him; but on looking at his face he saw that he was
absolutely serious, and had no thought of any deception."
"Hippolyte
beamed with gratification."
"“And yet I must die,” he said, and almost added: “a man like me!"
“And imagine how that Gania annoys me!
"He has developed the idea--or
pretends to believe--that in all probability three or four others who
heard my confession will die before I do."
"There’s an idea for you--and
all this by way of _consoling_ me!"
Ha!
ha!
ha!
"In the first place they
haven’t died yet; and in the second, if they _did_ die--all of them--what
would be the satisfaction to me in that?"
He judges me by himself.
"But he
goes further, he actually pitches into me because, as he declares, ‘any
decent fellow’ would die quietly, and that ‘all this’ is mere egotism
on my part."
"He doesn’t see what refinement of egotism it is on his own
part--and at the same time, what ox-like coarseness!"
"Have you ever read
of the death of one Stepan Gleboff, in the eighteenth century?"
"I read of
it yesterday by chance.”

“Who was he?”

“He was impaled on a stake in the time of Peter.”

“I know, I know!"
"He lay there fifteen hours in the hard frost, and died
with the most extraordinary fortitude--I know--what of him?”

“Only that God gives that sort of dying to some, and not to others."
"Perhaps you think, though, that I could not die like Gleboff?”

“Not at all!” said the prince, blushing."
"“I was only going to say that
you--not that you could not be like Gleboff--but that you would have
been more like--”

“I guess what you mean--I should be an Osterman, not a Gleboff--eh?"
"Is
that what you meant?”

“What Osterman?” asked the prince in some surprise."
"“Why, Osterman--the diplomatist."
"Peter’s Osterman,” muttered Hippolyte,
confused."
There was a moment’s pause of mutual confusion.
"“Oh, no, no!” said the prince at last, “that was not what I was going to
say--oh no!"
"I don’t think you would ever have been like Osterman.”

Hippolyte frowned gloomily."
"“I’ll tell you why I draw the conclusion,” explained the prince,
evidently desirous of clearing up the matter a little."
"“Because, though
I often think over the men of those times, I cannot for the life of me
imagine them to be like ourselves."
"It really appears to me that they
were of another race altogether than ourselves of today."
"At that time
people seemed to stick so to one idea; now, they are more nervous, more
sensitive, more enlightened--people of two or three ideas at once--as
it were."
"The man of today is a broader man, so to speak--and I declare
I believe that is what prevents him from being so self-contained and
independent a being as his brother of those earlier days."
"Of course my
remark was only made under this impression, and not in the least--”

“I quite understand."
"You are trying to comfort me for the naiveness with
which you disagreed with me--eh?"
Ha!
ha!
ha!
"You are a regular
child, prince!"
"However, I cannot help seeing that you always treat me
like--like a fragile china cup."
"Never mind, never mind, I’m not a bit
angry!"
At all events we have had a very funny talk.
"Do you know, all
things considered, I should like to be something better than Osterman!"
I wouldn’t take the trouble to rise from the dead to be an Osterman.
"However, I see I must make arrangements to die soon, or I myself--."
Well--leave me now!
"_Au revoir._ Look here--before you go, just give me
your opinion: how do you think I ought to die, now?"
"I mean--the best,
the most virtuous way?"
"Tell me!”

“You should pass us by and forgive us our happiness,” said the prince in
a low voice."
“Ha!
ha!
ha!
I thought so.
"I thought I should hear something like
that."
"Well, you are--you really are--oh dear me!"
"Eloquence, eloquence!"
"Good-bye!”

VI."
"As to the evening party at the Epanchins’ at which Princess Bielokonski
was to be present, Varia had reported with accuracy; though she had
perhaps expressed herself too strongly."
"The thing was decided in a hurry and with a certain amount of quite
unnecessary excitement, doubtless because “nothing could be done in this
house like anywhere else.”

The impatience of Lizabetha Prokofievna “to get things settled”
 explained a good deal, as well as the anxiety of both parents for the
happiness of their beloved daughter."
"Besides, Princess Bielokonski was
going away soon, and they hoped that she would take an interest in
the prince."
"They were anxious that he should enter society under the
auspices of this lady, whose patronage was the best of recommendations
for any young man."
"Even if there seems something strange about the match, the general and
his wife said to each other, the “world” will accept Aglaya’s fiance
without any question if he is under the patronage of the princess."
"In
any case, the prince would have to be “shown” sooner or later; that is,
introduced into society, of which he had, so far, not the least idea."
"Moreover, it was only a question of a small gathering of a few intimate
friends."
"Besides Princess Bielokonski, only one other lady was expected,
the wife of a high dignitary."
"Evgenie Pavlovitch, who was to escort the
princess, was the only young man."
"Muishkin was told of the princess’s visit three days beforehand, but
nothing was said to him about the party until the night before it was to
take place."
"He could not help observing the excited and agitated condition of all
members of the family, and from certain hints dropped in conversation he
gathered that they were all anxious as to the impression he should
make upon the princess."
"But the Epanchins, one and all, believed that
Muishkin, in his simplicity of mind, was quite incapable of realizing
that they could be feeling any anxiety on his account, and for this
reason they all looked at him with dread and uneasiness."
"In point of fact, he did attach marvellously little importance to the
approaching event."
He was occupied with altogether different thoughts.
"Aglaya was growing hourly more capricious and gloomy, and this
distressed him."
"When they told him that Evgenie Pavlovitch was expected,
he evinced great delight, and said that he had long wished to see
him--and somehow these words did not please anyone."
"Aglaya left the room in a fit of irritation, and it was not until late
in the evening, past eleven, when the prince was taking his departure,
that she said a word or two to him, privately, as she accompanied him as
far as the front door."
"“I should like you,” she said, “not to come here tomorrow until evening,
when the guests are all assembled."
"You know there are to be guests,
don’t you?”

She spoke impatiently and with severity; this was the first allusion she
had made to the party of tomorrow."
"She hated the idea of it, everyone saw that; and she would probably
have liked to quarrel about it with her parents, but pride and modesty
prevented her from broaching the subject."
"The prince jumped to the conclusion that Aglaya, too, was nervous about
him, and the impression he would make, and that she did not like to
admit her anxiety; and this thought alarmed him."
"“Yes, I am invited,” he replied."
She was evidently in difficulties as to how best to go on.
"“May I speak
of something serious to you, for once in my life?” she asked, angrily."
"She was irritated at she knew not what, and could not restrain her
wrath."
"“Of course you may; I am very glad to listen,” replied Muishkin."
"Aglaya was silent a moment and then began again with evident dislike of
her subject:

“I do not wish to quarrel with them about this; in some things they
won’t be reasonable."
"I always did feel a loathing for the laws which
seem to guide mamma’s conduct at times."
"I don’t speak of father, for
he cannot be expected to be anything but what he is."
"Mother is a
noble-minded woman, I know; you try to suggest anything mean to her,
and you’ll see!"
But she is such a slave to these miserable creatures!
"I
don’t mean old Bielokonski alone."
"She is a contemptible old thing, but
she is able to twist people round her little finger, and I admire that
in her, at all events!"
"How mean it all is, and how foolish!"
"We were
always middle-class, thoroughly middle-class, people."
"Why should we
attempt to climb into the giddy heights of the fashionable world?"
"My
sisters are all for it."
"It’s Prince S. they have to thank for poisoning
their minds."
"Why are you so glad that Evgenie Pavlovitch is coming?”

“Listen to me, Aglaya,” said the prince, “I do believe you are nervous
lest I shall make a fool of myself tomorrow at your party?”

“Nervous about you?” Aglaya blushed."
"“Why should I be nervous about
you?"
"What would it matter to me if you were to make ever such a fool of
yourself?"
How can you say such a thing?
"What do you mean by ‘making a
fool of yourself’?"
What a vulgar expression!
"I suppose you intend to
talk in that sort of way tomorrow evening?"
"Look up a few more such
expressions in your dictionary; do, you’ll make a grand effect!"
"I’m
sorry that you seem to be able to come into a room as gracefully as you
do; where did you learn the art?"
"Do you think you can drink a cup of tea
decently, when you know everybody is looking at you, on purpose to see
how you do it?”

“Yes, I think I can.”

“Can you?"
"I’m sorry for it then, for I should have had a good laugh at
you otherwise."
"Do break _something_ at least, in the drawing-room!"
"Upset
the Chinese vase, won’t you?"
It’s a valuable one; _do_ break it.
"Mamma
values it, and she’ll go out of her mind--it was a present."
"She’ll cry
before everyone, you’ll see!"
"Wave your hand about, you know, as you
always do, and just smash it."
"Sit down near it on purpose.”

“On the contrary, I shall sit as far from it as I can."
"Thanks for the
hint.”

“Ha, ha!"
Then you are afraid you _will_ wave your arms about!
"I wouldn’t
mind betting that you’ll talk about some lofty subject, something
serious and learned."
"How delightful, how tactful that will be!”

“I should think it would be very foolish indeed, unless it happened to
come in appropriately.”

“Look here, once for all,” cried Aglaya, boiling over, “if I hear you
talking about capital punishment, or the economical condition of
Russia, or about Beauty redeeming the world, or anything of that sort,
I’ll--well, of course I shall laugh and seem very pleased, but I warn
you beforehand, don’t look me in the face again!"
"I’m serious now,
mind, this time I _am really_ serious.” She certainly did say this very
seriously, so much so, that she looked quite different from what she
usually was, and the prince could not help noticing the fact."
"She did
not seem to be joking in the slightest degree."
"“Well, you’ve put me into such a fright that I shall certainly make
a fool of myself, and very likely break something too."
"I wasn’t a bit
alarmed before, but now I’m as nervous as can be.”

“Then don’t speak at all."
"Sit still and don’t talk.”

“Oh, I can’t do that, you know!"
"I shall say something foolish out of
pure ‘funk,’ and break something for the same excellent reason; I know
I shall."
"Perhaps I shall slip and fall on the slippery floor; I’ve done
that before now, you know."
I shall dream of it all night now.
"Why did
you say anything about it?”

Aglaya looked blackly at him."
"“Do you know what, I had better not come at all tomorrow!"
"I’ll plead
sick-list and stay away,” said the prince, with decision."
"Aglaya stamped her foot, and grew quite pale with anger."
"“Oh, my goodness!"
Just listen to that!
"‘Better not come,’ when the party
is on purpose for him!"
Good Lord!
"What a delightful thing it is to have
to do with such a--such a stupid as you are!”

“Well, I’ll come, I’ll come,” interrupted the prince, hastily, “and I’ll
give you my word of honour that I will sit the whole evening and not say
a word.”

“I believe that’s the best thing you can do."
"You said you’d ‘plead
sick-list’ just now; where in the world do you get hold of such
expressions?"
Why do you talk to me like this?
"Are you trying to irritate
me, or what?”

“Forgive me, it’s a schoolboy expression."
I won’t do it again.
"I know
quite well, I see it, that you are anxious on my account (now, don’t be
angry), and it makes me very happy to see it."
"You wouldn’t believe
how frightened I am of misbehaving somehow, and how glad I am of your
instructions."
"But all this panic is simply nonsense, you know, Aglaya!"
"I
give you my word it is; I am so pleased that you are such a child, such
a dear good child."
"How _charming_ you can be if you like, Aglaya.”

Aglaya wanted to be angry, of course, but suddenly some quite unexpected
feeling seized upon her heart, all in a moment."
"“And you won’t reproach me for all these rude words of mine--some
day--afterwards?” she asked, of a sudden."
“What an idea!
Of course not.
And what are you blushing for again?
"And
there comes that frown once more!"
"You’ve taken to looking too gloomy
sometimes, Aglaya, much more than you used to."
"I know why it is.”

“Be quiet, do be quiet!”

“No, no, I had much better speak out."
"I have long wished to say it, and
_have_ said it, but that’s not enough, for you didn’t believe me."
"Between
us two there stands a being who--”

“Be quiet, be quiet, be quiet, be quiet!” Aglaya struck in, suddenly,
seizing his hand in hers, and gazing at him almost in terror."
At this moment she was called by someone.
"She broke loose from him with
an air of relief and ran away."
The prince was in a fever all night.
"It was strange, but he had suffered
from fever for several nights in succession."
"On this particular night,
while in semi-delirium, he had an idea: what if on the morrow he were
to have a fit before everybody?"
"The thought seemed to freeze his blood
within him."
"All night he fancied himself in some extraordinary society
of strange persons."
"The worst of it was that he was talking nonsense;
he knew that he ought not to speak at all, and yet he talked the whole
time; he seemed to be trying to persuade them all to something."
"Evgenie
and Hippolyte were among the guests, and appeared to be great friends."
"He awoke towards nine o’clock with a headache, full of confused ideas
and strange impressions."
"For some reason or other he felt most anxious
to see Rogojin, to see and talk to him, but what he wished to say he
could not tell."
"Next, he determined to go and see Hippolyte."
"His mind
was in a confused state, so much so that the incidents of the morning
seemed to be imperfectly realized, though acutely felt."
One of these incidents was a visit from Lebedeff.
"Lebedeff came rather
early--before ten--but he was tipsy already."
"Though the prince was not
in an observant condition, yet he could not avoid seeing that for at
least three days--ever since General Ivolgin had left the house Lebedeff
had been behaving very badly."
"He looked untidy and dirty at all times
of the day, and it was said that he had begun to rage about in his own
house, and that his temper was very bad."
"As soon as he arrived this
morning, he began to hold forth, beating his breast and apparently
blaming himself for something."
"“I’ve--I’ve had a reward for my meanness--I’ve had a slap in the face,”
 he concluded, tragically."
“A slap in the face?
From whom?
"And so early in the morning?”

“Early?” said Lebedeff, sarcastically."
"“Time counts for nothing, even in
physical chastisement; but my slap in the face was not physical, it was
moral.”

He suddenly took a seat, very unceremoniously, and began his story."
"It
was very disconnected; the prince frowned, and wished he could get away;
but suddenly a few words struck him."
"He sat stiff with wonder--Lebedeff
said some extraordinary things."
"In the first place he began about some letter; the name of Aglaya
Ivanovna came in."
"Then suddenly he broke off and began to accuse the
prince of something; he was apparently offended with him."
"At first he
declared that the prince had trusted him with his confidences as to “a
certain person” (Nastasia Philipovna), but that of late his friendship
had been thrust back into his bosom, and his innocent question as to
“approaching family changes” had been curtly put aside, which Lebedeff
declared, with tipsy tears, he could not bear; especially as he knew so
much already both from Rogojin and Nastasia Philipovna and her friend,
and from Varvara Ardalionovna, and even from Aglaya Ivanovna, through
his daughter Vera."
"“And who told Lizabetha Prokofievna something in
secret, by letter?"
"Who told her all about the movements of a certain
person called Nastasia Philipovna?"
"Who was the anonymous person, eh?"
"Tell me!”

“Surely not you?” cried the prince."
"“Just so,” said Lebedeff, with dignity; “and only this very morning I
have sent up a letter to the noble lady, stating that I have a matter of
great importance to communicate."
"She received the letter; I know she got
it; and she received _me_, too.”

“Have you just seen Lizabetha Prokofievna?” asked the prince, scarcely
believing his ears."
"“Yes, I saw her, and got the said slap in the face as mentioned."
"She
chucked the letter back to me unopened, and kicked me out of the house,
morally, not physically, although not far off it.”

“What letter do you mean she returned unopened?”

“What!"
didn’t I tell you?
"Ha, ha, ha!"
I thought I had.
"Why, I received a
letter, you know, to be handed over--”

“From whom?"
"To whom?”

But it was difficult, if not impossible, to extract anything from
Lebedeff."
"All the prince could gather was, that the letter had been
received very early, and had a request written on the outside that it
might be sent on to the address given."
"“Just as before, sir, just as before!"
"To a certain person, and from
a certain hand."
"The individual’s name who wrote the letter is to be
represented by the letter A.--”

“What?"
Impossible!
To Nastasia Philipovna?
Nonsense!” cried the prince.
"“It was, I assure you, and if not to her then to Rogojin, which is
the same thing."
"Mr. Hippolyte has had letters, too, and all from the
individual whose name begins with an A.,” smirked Lebedeff, with a
hideous grin."
"As he kept jumping from subject to subject, and forgetting what he had
begun to talk about, the prince said nothing, but waited, to give him
time."
It was all very vague.
"Who had taken the letters, if letters there were?"
Probably Vera--and how could Lebedeff have got them?
"In all probability,
he had managed to steal the present letter from Vera, and had himself
gone over to Lizabetha Prokofievna with some idea in his head."
"So the
prince concluded at last."
"“You are mad!” he cried, indignantly."
"“Not quite, esteemed prince,” replied Lebedeff, with some acerbity."
"“I
confess I thought of doing you the service of handing the letter over to
yourself, but I decided that it would pay me better to deliver it up to
the noble lady aforesaid, as I had informed her of everything hitherto
by anonymous letters; so when I sent her up a note from myself, with
the letter, you know, in order to fix a meeting for eight o’clock this
morning, I signed it ‘your secret correspondent.’ They let me in at
once--very quickly--by the back door, and the noble lady received me.”

“Well?"
"Go on.”

“Oh, well, when I saw her she almost punched my head, as I say; in fact
so nearly that one might almost say she did punch my head."
"She threw
the letter in my face; she seemed to reflect first, as if she would
have liked to keep it, but thought better of it and threw it in my face
instead."
"‘If anybody can have been such a fool as to trust a man like
you to deliver the letter,’ says she, ‘take it and deliver it!’ Hey!"
"she
was grandly indignant."
"A fierce, fiery lady that, sir!”

“Where’s the letter now?”

“Oh, I’ve still got it, here!”

And he handed the prince the very letter from Aglaya to Gania, which the
latter showed with so much triumph to his sister at a later hour."
"“This letter cannot be allowed to remain in your hands.”

“It’s for you--for you!"
"I’ve brought it you on purpose!” cried Lebedeff,
excitedly."
"“Why, I’m yours again now, heart and hand, your slave; there
was but a momentary pause in the flow of my love and esteem for you."
"Mea
culpa, mea culpa!"
"as the Pope of Rome says.”

“This letter should be sent on at once,” said the prince, disturbed."
"“I’ll hand it over myself.”

“Wouldn’t it be better, esteemed prince, wouldn’t it be
better--to--don’t you know--”

Lebedeff made a strange and very expressive grimace; he twisted about in
his chair, and did something, apparently symbolical, with his hands."
“What do you mean?” said the prince.
"“Why, open it, for the time being, don’t you know?” he said, most
confidentially and mysteriously."
"The prince jumped up so furiously that Lebedeff ran towards the door;
having gained which strategic position, however, he stopped and looked
back to see if he might hope for pardon."
"“Oh, Lebedeff, Lebedeff!"
"Can a man really sink to such depths of
meanness?” said the prince, sadly."
Lebedeff’s face brightened.
"“Oh, I’m a mean wretch--a mean wretch!” he said, approaching the prince
once more, and beating his breast, with tears in his eyes."
"“It’s abominable dishonesty, you know!”

“Dishonesty--it is, it is!"
"That’s the very word!”

“What in the world induces you to act so?"
You are nothing but a spy.
Why did you write anonymously to worry so noble and generous a lady?
"Why
should not Aglaya Ivanovna write a note to whomever she pleases?"
"What
did you mean to complain of today?"
What did you expect to get by it?
"What made you go at all?”

“Pure amiable curiosity,--I assure you--desire to do a service."
"That’s
all."
"Now I’m entirely yours again, your slave; hang me if you like!”

“Did you go before Lizabetha Prokofievna in your present condition?”
 inquired the prince."
"“No--oh no, fresher--more the correct card."
"I only became this like
after the humiliation I suffered there.”

“Well--that’ll do; now leave me.”

This injunction had to be repeated several times before the man could be
persuaded to move."
"Even then he turned back at the door, came as far as
the middle of the room, and there went through his mysterious motions
designed to convey the suggestion that the prince should open the
letter."
He did not dare put his suggestion into words again.
"After this performance, he smiled sweetly and left the room on tiptoe."
All this had been very painful to listen to.
"One fact stood out certain
and clear, and that was that poor Aglaya must be in a state of great
distress and indecision and mental torment (“from jealousy,” the prince
whispered to himself)."
"Undoubtedly in this inexperienced, but hot and
proud little head, there were all sorts of plans forming, wild and
impossible plans, maybe; and the idea of this so frightened the prince
that he could not make up his mind what to do."
"Something must be done,
that was clear."
He looked at the address on the letter once more.
"Oh, he was not in the
least degree alarmed about Aglaya writing such a letter; he could trust
her."
What he did not like about it was that he could not trust Gania.
"However, he made up his mind that he would himself take the note and
deliver it."
"Indeed, he went so far as to leave the house and walk up the
road, but changed his mind when he had nearly reached Ptitsin’s door."
"However, he there luckily met Colia, and commissioned him to deliver the
letter to his brother as if direct from Aglaya."
"Colia asked no questions
but simply delivered it, and Gania consequently had no suspicion that it
had passed through so many hands."
"Arrived home again, the prince sent for Vera Lebedeff and told her as
much as was necessary, in order to relieve her mind, for she had been in
a dreadful state of anxiety since she had missed the letter."
"She heard
with horror that her father had taken it."
"Muishkin learned from her that
she had on several occasions performed secret missions both for Aglaya
and for Rogojin, without, however, having had the slightest idea that in
so doing she might injure the prince in any way."
"The latter, with one thing and another, was now so disturbed and
confused, that when, a couple of hours or so later, a message came from
Colia that the general was ill, he could hardly take the news in."
"However, when he did master the fact, it acted upon him as a tonic
by completely distracting his attention."
"He went at once to Nina
Alexandrovna’s, whither the general had been carried, and stayed there
until the evening."
"He could do no good, but there are people whom
to have near one is a blessing at such times."
"Colia was in an almost
hysterical state; he cried continuously, but was running about all day,
all the same; fetching doctors, of whom he collected three; going to the
chemist’s, and so on."
"The general was brought round to some extent, but the doctors
declared that he could not be said to be out of danger."
"Varia and Nina
Alexandrovna never left the sick man’s bedside; Gania was excited and
distressed, but would not go upstairs, and seemed afraid to look at the
patient."
"He wrung his hands when the prince spoke to him, and said that
“such a misfortune at such a moment” was terrible."
"The prince thought he knew what Gania meant by “such a moment.”

Hippolyte was not in the house."
"Lebedeff turned up late in the
afternoon; he had been asleep ever since his interview with the prince
in the morning."
"He was quite sober now, and cried with real sincerity
over the sick general--mourning for him as though he were his own
brother."
"He blamed himself aloud, but did not explain why."
"He repeated
over and over again to Nina Alexandrovna that he alone was to blame--no
one else--but that he had acted out of “pure amiable curiosity,” and
that “the deceased,” as he insisted upon calling the still living
general, had been the greatest of geniuses."
"He laid much stress on the genius of the sufferer, as if this idea must
be one of immense solace in the present crisis."
"Nina Alexandrovna--seeing his sincerity of feeling--said at last,
and without the faintest suspicion of reproach in her voice: “Come,
come--don’t cry!"
"God will forgive you!”

Lebedeff was so impressed by these words, and the tone in which
they were spoken, that he could not leave Nina Alexandrovna all the
evening--in fact, for several days."
"Till the general’s death, indeed, he
spent almost all his time at his side."
"Twice during the day a messenger came to Nina Alexandrovna from the
Epanchins to inquire after the invalid."
"When--late in the evening--the prince made his appearance in Lizabetha
Prokofievna’s drawing-room, he found it full of guests."
"Mrs. Epanchin
questioned him very fully about the general as soon as he appeared; and
when old Princess Bielokonski wished to know “who this general was, and
who was Nina Alexandrovna,” she proceeded to explain in a manner which
pleased the prince very much."
"He himself, when relating the circumstances of the general’s illness to
Lizabetha Prokofievna, “spoke beautifully,” as Aglaya’s sisters declared
afterwards--“modestly, quietly, without gestures or too many words, and
with great dignity.” He had entered the room with propriety and grace,
and he was perfectly dressed; he not only did not “fall down on the
slippery floor,” as he had expressed it, but evidently made a very
favourable impression upon the assembled guests."
"As for his own impression on entering the room and taking his seat,
he instantly remarked that the company was not in the least such
as Aglaya’s words had led him to fear, and as he had dreamed of--in
nightmare form--all night."
"This was the first time in his life that he had seen a little corner of
what was generally known by the terrible name of “society.” He had long
thirsted, for reasons of his own, to penetrate the mysteries of the
magic circle, and, therefore, this assemblage was of the greatest
possible interest to him."
His first impression was one of fascination.
"Somehow or other he felt
that all these people must have been born on purpose to be together!"
"It
seemed to him that the Epanchins were not having a party at all; that
these people must have been here always, and that he himself was one
of them--returned among them after a long absence, but one of them,
naturally and indisputably."
"It never struck him that all this refined simplicity and nobility and
wit and personal dignity might possibly be no more than an exquisite
artistic polish."
"The majority of the guests--who were somewhat
empty-headed, after all, in spite of their aristocratic bearing--never
guessed, in their self-satisfied composure, that much of their
superiority was mere veneer, which indeed they had adopted unconsciously
and by inheritance."
"The prince would never so much as suspect such a thing in the delight of
his first impression."
"He saw, for instance, that one important dignitary, old enough to be his
grandfather, broke off his own conversation in order to listen to _him_--a
young and inexperienced man; and not only listened, but seemed to
attach value to his opinion, and was kind and amiable, and yet they
were strangers and had never seen each other before."
"Perhaps what most
appealed to the prince’s impressionability was the refinement of the old
man’s courtesy towards him."
"Perhaps the soil of his susceptible nature
was really predisposed to receive a pleasant impression."
"Meanwhile all these people--though friends of the family and of each
other to a certain extent--were very far from being such intimate
friends of the family and of each other as the prince concluded."
"There
were some present who never would think of considering the Epanchins
their equals."
There were even some who hated one another cordially.
"For
instance, old Princess Bielokonski had all her life despised the wife
of the “dignitary,” while the latter was very far from loving Lizabetha
Prokofievna."
"The dignitary himself had been General Epanchin’s protector
from his youth up; and the general considered him so majestic a
personage that he would have felt a hearty contempt for himself if
he had even for one moment allowed himself to pose as the great man’s
equal, or to think of him--in his fear and reverence--as anything less
than an Olympic God!"
"There were others present who had not met for
years, and who had no feeling whatever for each other, unless it were
dislike; and yet they met tonight as though they had seen each other but
yesterday in some friendly and intimate assembly of kindred spirits."
"It was not a large party, however."
"Besides Princess Bielokonski and the
old dignitary (who was really a great man) and his wife, there was an
old military general--a count or baron with a German name, a man reputed
to possess great knowledge and administrative ability."
"He was one
of those Olympian administrators who know everything except Russia,
pronounce a word of extraordinary wisdom, admired by all, about once in
five years, and, after being an eternity in the service, generally die
full of honour and riches, though they have never done anything great,
and have even been hostile to all greatness."
"This general was Ivan
Fedorovitch’s immediate superior in the service; and it pleased the
latter to look upon him also as a patron."
"On the other hand, the great
man did not at all consider himself Epanchin’s patron."
"He was always
very cool to him, while taking advantage of his ready services, and
would instantly have put another in his place if there had been the
slightest reason for the change."
"Another guest was an elderly, important-looking gentleman, a distant
relative of Lizabetha Prokofievna’s."
"This gentleman was rich, held a
good position, was a great talker, and had the reputation of being “one
of the dissatisfied,” though not belonging to the dangerous sections
of that class."
"He had the manners, to some extent, of the English
aristocracy, and some of their tastes (especially in the matter of
under-done roast beef, harness, men-servants, etc.)."
"He was a great
friend of the dignitary’s, and Lizabetha Prokofievna, for some reason or
other, had got hold of the idea that this worthy intended at no distant
date to offer the advantages of his hand and heart to Alexandra."
"Besides the elevated and more solid individuals enumerated, there were
present a few younger though not less elegant guests."
"Besides Prince S.
and Evgenie Pavlovitch, we must name the eminent and fascinating Prince
N.--once the vanquisher of female hearts all over Europe."
"This gentleman
was no longer in the first bloom of youth--he was forty-five, but still
very handsome."
"He was well off, and lived, as a rule, abroad, and was
noted as a good teller of stories."
"Then came a few guests belonging to
a lower stratum of society--people who, like the Epanchins themselves,
moved only occasionally in this exalted sphere."
"The Epanchins liked to
draft among their more elevated guests a few picked representatives of
this lower stratum, and Lizabetha Prokofievna received much praise for
this practice, which proved, her friends said, that she was a woman of
tact."
"The Epanchins prided themselves upon the good opinion people held
of them."
"One of the representatives of the middle-class present today was a
colonel of engineers, a very serious man and a great friend of Prince
S., who had introduced him to the Epanchins."
"He was extremely silent in
society, and displayed on the forefinger of his right hand a large ring,
probably bestowed upon him for services of some sort."
"There was also
a poet, German by name, but a Russian poet; very presentable, and even
handsome--the sort of man one could bring into society with impunity."
"This gentleman belonged to a German family of decidedly bourgeois
origin, but he had a knack of acquiring the patronage of “big-wigs,” and
of retaining their favour."
"He had translated some great German poem into
Russian verse, and claimed to have been a friend of a famous Russian
poet, since dead."
"(It is strange how great a multitude of literary
people there are who have had the advantages of friendship with some
great man of their own profession who is, unfortunately, dead.)"
"The
dignitary’s wife had introduced this worthy to the Epanchins."
"This
lady posed as the patroness of literary people, and she certainly
had succeeded in obtaining pensions for a few of them, thanks to her
influence with those in authority on such matters."
"She was a lady of
weight in her own way."
"Her age was about forty-five, so that she was a
very young wife for such an elderly husband as the dignitary."
"She had
been a beauty in her day and still loved, as many ladies of forty-five
do love, to dress a little too smartly."
"Her intellect was nothing to
boast of, and her literary knowledge very doubtful."
"Literary patronage
was, however, with her as much a mania as was the love of gorgeous
clothes."
"Many books and translations were dedicated to her by her
proteges, and a few of these talented individuals had published some of
their own letters to her, upon very weighty subjects."
"This, then, was the society that the prince accepted at once as true
coin, as pure gold without alloy."
"It so happened, however, that on this particular evening all these good
people were in excellent humour and highly pleased with themselves."
"Every one of them felt that they were doing the Epanchins the greatest
possible honour by their presence."
But alas!
"the prince never suspected
any such subtleties!"
"For instance, he had no suspicion of the fact that
the Epanchins, having in their mind so important a step as the marriage
of their daughter, would never think of presuming to take it without
having previously “shown off” the proposed husband to the dignitary--the
recognized patron of the family."
"The latter, too, though he would
probably have received news of a great disaster to the Epanchin family
with perfect composure, would nevertheless have considered it a personal
offence if they had dared to marry their daughter without his advice, or
we might almost say, his leave."
"The amiable and undoubtedly witty Prince N. could not but feel that
he was as a sun, risen for one night only to shine upon the Epanchin
drawing-room."
"He accounted them immeasurably his inferiors, and it was
this feeling which caused his special amiability and delightful ease and
grace towards them."
"He knew very well that he must tell some story this
evening for the edification of the company, and led up to it with the
inspiration of anticipatory triumph."
"The prince, when he heard the story afterwards, felt that he had never
yet come across so wonderful a humorist, or such remarkable brilliancy
as was shown by this man; and yet if he had only known it, this story
was the oldest, stalest, and most worn-out yarn, and every drawing-room
in town was sick to death of it."
"It was only in the innocent Epanchin
household that it passed for a new and brilliant tale--as a sudden and
striking reminiscence of a splendid and talented man."
"Even the German poet, though as amiable as possible, felt that he was
doing the house the greatest of honours by his presence in it."
"But the prince only looked at the bright side; he did not turn the coat
and see the shabby lining."
Aglaya had not foreseen that particular calamity.
"She herself looked
wonderfully beautiful this evening."
"All three sisters were dressed very
tastefully, and their hair was done with special care."
"Aglaya sat next to Evgenie Pavlovitch, and laughed and talked to him
with an unusual display of friendliness."
"Evgenie himself behaved rather
more sedately than usual, probably out of respect to the dignitary."
Evgenie had been known in society for a long while.
"He had appeared at
the Epanchins’ today with crape on his hat, and Princess Bielokonski had
commended this action on his part."
"Not every society man would have worn
crape for “such an uncle.” Lizabetha Prokofievna had liked it also, but
was too preoccupied to take much notice."
"The prince remarked that Aglaya
looked attentively at him two or three times, and seemed to be satisfied
with his behaviour."
Little by little he became very happy indeed.
"All his late anxieties and
apprehensions (after his conversation with Lebedeff) now appeared like
so many bad dreams--impossible, and even laughable."
"He did not speak much, only answering such questions as were put to him,
and gradually settled down into unbroken silence, listening to what went
on, and steeped in perfect satisfaction and contentment."
"Little by little a sort of inspiration, however, began to stir within
him, ready to spring into life at the right moment."
"When he did begin
to speak, it was accidentally, in response to a question, and apparently
without any special object."
VII.
"While he feasted his eyes upon Aglaya, as she talked merrily with
Evgenie and Prince N., suddenly the old anglomaniac, who was talking to
the dignitary in another corner of the room, apparently telling him a
story about something or other--suddenly this gentleman pronounced
the name of “Nicolai Andreevitch Pavlicheff” aloud."
"The prince quickly
turned towards him, and listened."
"The conversation had been on the subject of land, and the present
disorders, and there must have been something amusing said, for the old
man had begun to laugh at his companion’s heated expressions."
"The latter was describing in eloquent words how, in consequence of
recent legislation, he was obliged to sell a beautiful estate in the N.
province, not because he wanted ready money--in fact, he was obliged
to sell it at half its value."
"“To avoid another lawsuit about the
Pavlicheff estate, I ran away,” he said."
"“With a few more inheritances
of that kind I should soon be ruined!”

At this point General Epanchin, noticing how interested Muishkin had
become in the conversation, said to him, in a low tone:

“That gentleman--Ivan Petrovitch--is a relation of your late friend, Mr.
Pavlicheff."
"You wanted to find some of his relations, did you not?”

The general, who had been talking to his chief up to this moment, had
observed the prince’s solitude and silence, and was anxious to draw him
into the conversation, and so introduce him again to the notice of some
of the important personages."
"“Lef Nicolaievitch was a ward of Nicolai Andreevitch Pavlicheff, after
the death of his own parents,” he remarked, meeting Ivan Petrovitch’s
eye."
"“Very happy to meet him, I’m sure,” remarked the latter."
"“I remember
Lef Nicolaievitch well."
"When General Epanchin introduced us just now,
I recognized you at once, prince."
"You are very little changed, though
I saw you last as a child of some ten or eleven years old."
"There was
something in your features, I suppose, that--”

“You saw me as a child!” exclaimed the prince, with surprise."
“Oh!
"yes, long ago,” continued Ivan Petrovitch, “while you were living
with my cousin at Zlatoverhoff."
You don’t remember me?
"No, I dare
say you don’t; you had some malady at the time, I remember."
"It was so
serious that I was surprised--”

“No; I remember nothing!” said the prince."
"A few more words of
explanation followed, words which were spoken without the smallest
excitement by his companion, but which evoked the greatest agitation in
the prince; and it was discovered that two old ladies to whose care the
prince had been left by Pavlicheff, and who lived at Zlatoverhoff, were
also relations of Ivan Petrovitch."
"The latter had no idea and could give no information as to why
Pavlicheff had taken so great an interest in the little prince, his
ward."
"“In point of fact I don’t think I thought much about it,” said the old
fellow."
"He seemed to have a wonderfully good memory, however, for he
told the prince all about the two old ladies, Pavlicheff’s cousins, who
had taken care of him, and whom, he declared, he had taken to task
for being too severe with the prince as a small sickly boy--the elder
sister, at least; the younger had been kind, he recollected."
"They
both now lived in another province, on a small estate left to them by
Pavlicheff."
"The prince listened to all this with eyes sparkling with
emotion and delight."
"He declared with unusual warmth that he would never forgive himself for
having travelled about in the central provinces during these last six
months without having hunted up his two old friends."
"He declared, further, that he had intended to go every day, but had
always been prevented by circumstances; but that now he would promise
himself the pleasure--however far it was, he would find them out."
"And so
Ivan Petrovitch _really_ knew Natalia Nikitishna!--what a saintly nature
was hers!--and Martha Nikitishna!"
"Ivan Petrovitch must excuse him,
but really he was not quite fair on dear old Martha."
"She was severe,
perhaps; but then what else could she be with such a little idiot as he
was then?"
"(Ha, ha.)"
"He really was an idiot then, Ivan Petrovitch must
know, though he might not believe it."
"(Ha, ha.)"
"So he had really seen
him there!"
Good heavens!
"And was he really and truly and actually a
cousin of Pavlicheff’s?"
"“I assure you of it,” laughed Ivan Petrovitch, gazing amusedly at the
prince."
“Oh!
"I didn’t say it because I _doubt_ the fact, you know."
"(Ha, ha.)"
How could I doubt such a thing?
"(Ha, ha, ha.)"
"I made the remark
because--because Nicolai Andreevitch Pavlicheff was such a splendid man,
don’t you see!"
"Such a high-souled man, he really was, I assure you.”

The prince did not exactly pant for breath, but he “seemed almost
to _choke_ out of pure simplicity and goodness of heart,” as Adelaida
expressed it, on talking the party over with her fiance, the Prince S.,
next morning."
"“But, my goodness me,” laughed Ivan Petrovitch, “why can’t I be cousin
to even a splendid man?”

“Oh, dear!” cried the prince, confused, trying to hurry his words
out, and growing more and more eager every moment: “I’ve gone and said
another stupid thing."
I don’t know what to say.
"I--I didn’t mean that,
you know--I--I--he really was such a splendid man, wasn’t he?”

The prince trembled all over."
Why was he so agitated?
"Why had he flown
into such transports of delight without any apparent reason?"
"He had far
outshot the measure of joy and emotion consistent with the occasion."
"Why
this was it would be difficult to say."
"He seemed to feel warmly and deeply grateful to someone for something or
other--perhaps to Ivan Petrovitch; but likely enough to all the guests,
individually, and collectively."
He was much too happy.
"Ivan Petrovitch began to stare at him with some surprise; the dignitary,
too, looked at him with considerable attention; Princess Bielokonski
glared at him angrily, and compressed her lips."
"Prince N., Evgenie,
Prince S., and the girls, all broke off their own conversations and
listened."
"Aglaya seemed a little startled; as for Lizabetha Prokofievna,
her heart sank within her."
This was odd of Lizabetha Prokofievna and her daughters.
"They had
themselves decided that it would be better if the prince did not talk
all the evening."
"Yet seeing him sitting silent and alone, but perfectly
happy, they had been on the point of exerting themselves to draw him
into one of the groups of talkers around the room."
"Now that he was in
the midst of a talk they became more than ever anxious and perturbed."
"“That he was a splendid man is perfectly true; you are quite right,”
 repeated Ivan Petrovitch, but seriously this time."
"“He was a fine and a
worthy fellow--worthy, one may say, of the highest respect,” he added,
more and more seriously at each pause; “and it is agreeable to see, on
your part, such--”

“Wasn’t it this same Pavlicheff about whom there was a strange story in
connection with some abbot?"
"I don’t remember who the abbot was, but I
remember at one time everybody was talking about it,” remarked the old
dignitary."
"“Yes--Abbot Gurot, a Jesuit,” said Ivan Petrovitch."
"“Yes, that’s the
sort of thing our best men are apt to do."
"A man of rank, too, and
rich--a man who, if he had continued to serve, might have done anything;
and then to throw up the service and everything else in order to go over
to Roman Catholicism and turn Jesuit--openly, too--almost triumphantly."
By Jove!
"it was positively a mercy that he died when he did--it was
indeed--everyone said so at the time.”

The prince was beside himself."
“Pavlicheff?--Pavlicheff turned Roman Catholic?
"Impossible!” he cried,
in horror."
“H’m!
"impossible is rather a strong word,” said Ivan Petrovitch."
"“You
must allow, my dear prince..."
"However, of course you value the memory of
the deceased so very highly; and he certainly was the kindest of men;
to which fact, by the way, I ascribe, more than to anything else, the
success of the abbot in influencing his religious convictions."
"But you
may ask me, if you please, how much trouble and worry I, personally,
had over that business, and especially with this same Gurot!"
"Would you
believe it,” he continued, addressing the dignitary, “they actually
tried to put in a claim under the deceased’s will, and I had to resort
to the very strongest measures in order to bring them to their senses?"
"I assure you they knew their cue, did these gentlemen--wonderful!"
"Thank
goodness all this was in Moscow, and I got the Court, you know, to help
me, and we soon brought them to their senses.”

“You wouldn’t believe how you have pained and astonished me,” cried the
prince."
"“Very sorry; but in point of fact, you know, it was all nonsense and
would have ended in smoke, as usual--I’m sure of that."
"Last year,”--he
turned to the old man again,--“Countess K. joined some Roman Convent
abroad."
"Our people never seem to be able to offer any resistance so soon
as they get into the hands of these--intriguers--especially abroad.”

“That is all thanks to our lassitude, I think,” replied the old man,
with authority."
"“And then their way of preaching; they have a skilful
manner of doing it!"
"And they know how to startle one, too."
"I got quite
a fright myself in ’32, in Vienna, I assure you; but I didn’t cave in to
them, I ran away instead, ha, ha!”

“Come, come, I’ve always heard that you ran away with the beautiful
Countess Levitsky that time--throwing up everything in order to do
it--and not from the Jesuits at all,” said Princess Bielokonski,
suddenly."
"“Well, yes--but we call it from the Jesuits, you know; it comes to
the same thing,” laughed the old fellow, delighted with the pleasant
recollection."
"“You seem to be very religious,” he continued, kindly, addressing the
prince, “which is a thing one meets so seldom nowadays among young
people.”

The prince was listening open-mouthed, and still in a condition of
excited agitation."
"The old man was evidently interested in him, and
anxious to study him more closely."
"“Pavlicheff was a man of bright intellect and a good Christian, a
sincere Christian,” said the prince, suddenly."
"“How could he possibly
embrace a faith which is unchristian?"
"Roman Catholicism is, so to speak,
simply the same thing as unchristianity,” he added with flashing eyes,
which seemed to take in everybody in the room."
"“Come, that’s a little _too_ strong, isn’t it?” murmured the old man,
glancing at General Epanchin in surprise."
"“How do you make out that the Roman Catholic religion is _unchristian?_
What is it, then?” asked Ivan Petrovitch, turning to the prince."
"“It is not a Christian religion, in the first place,” said the latter,
in extreme agitation, quite out of proportion to the necessity of the
moment."
"“And in the second place, Roman Catholicism is, in my opinion,
worse than Atheism itself."
Yes--that is my opinion.
"Atheism only
preaches a negation, but Romanism goes further; it preaches a
disfigured, distorted Christ--it preaches Anti-Christ--I assure you, I
swear it!"
"This is my own personal conviction, and it has long distressed
me."
"The Roman Catholic believes that the Church on earth cannot stand
without universal temporal Power."
"He cries ‘non possumus!’ In my
opinion the Roman Catholic religion is not a faith at all, but simply a
continuation of the Roman Empire, and everything is subordinated to
this idea--beginning with faith."
"The Pope has seized territories and an
earthly throne, and has held them with the sword."
"And so the thing has
gone on, only that to the sword they have added lying, intrigue, deceit,
fanaticism, superstition, swindling;--they have played fast and loose
with the most sacred and sincere feelings of men;--they have exchanged
everything--everything for money, for base earthly _power!_ And is this
not the teaching of Anti-Christ?"
"How could the upshot of all this
be other than Atheism?"
"Atheism is the child of Roman Catholicism--it
proceeded from these Romans themselves, though perhaps they would not
believe it."
"It grew and fattened on hatred of its parents; it is the
progeny of their lies and spiritual feebleness."
Atheism!
"In our country
it is only among the upper classes that you find unbelievers; men who
have lost the root or spirit of their faith; but abroad whole masses of
the people are beginning to profess unbelief--at first because of
the darkness and lies by which they were surrounded; but now out of
fanaticism, out of loathing for the Church and Christianity!”

The prince paused to get breath."
"He had spoken with extraordinary
rapidity, and was very pale."
"All present interchanged glances, but at last the old dignitary burst
out laughing frankly."
"Prince N. took out his eye-glass to have a good
look at the speaker."
"The German poet came out of his corner and crept
nearer to the table, with a spiteful smile."
"“You exaggerate the matter very much,” said Ivan Petrovitch, with rather
a bored air."
"“There are, in the foreign Churches, many representatives
of their faith who are worthy of respect and esteem.”

“Oh, but I did not speak of individual representatives."
"I was merely
talking about Roman Catholicism, and its essence--of Rome itself."
"A
Church can never entirely disappear; I never hinted at that!”

“Agreed that all this may be true; but we need not discuss a subject
which belongs to the domain of theology.”

“Oh, no; oh, no!"
"Not to theology alone, I assure you!"
"Why, Socialism is
the progeny of Romanism and of the Romanistic spirit."
"It and its brother
Atheism proceed from Despair in opposition to Catholicism."
"It seeks to
replace in itself the moral power of religion, in order to appease the
spiritual thirst of parched humanity and save it; not by Christ, but
by force."
"‘Don’t dare to believe in God, don’t dare to possess any
individuality, any property!"
_Fraternité ou la Mort_; two million heads.
‘By their works ye shall know them’--we are told.
"And we must not
suppose that all this is harmless and without danger to ourselves."
"Oh,
no; we must resist, and quickly, quickly!"
"We must let our Christ shine
forth upon the Western nations, our Christ whom we have preserved
intact, and whom they have never known."
"Not as slaves, allowing
ourselves to be caught by the hooks of the Jesuits, but carrying our
Russian civilization to _them_, we must stand before them, not letting it
be said among us that their preaching is ‘skilful,’ as someone expressed
it just now.”

“But excuse me, excuse me;” cried Ivan Petrovitch considerably
disturbed, and looking around uneasily."
"“Your ideas are, of course, most
praiseworthy, and in the highest degree patriotic; but you exaggerate
the matter terribly."
"It would be better if we dropped the subject.”

“No, sir, I do not exaggerate, I understate the matter, if anything,
undoubtedly understate it; simply because I cannot express myself as I
should like, but--”

“Allow me!”

The prince was silent."
"He sat straight up in his chair and gazed
fervently at Ivan Petrovitch."
"“It seems to me that you have been too painfully impressed by the news
of what happened to your good benefactor,” said the old dignitary,
kindly, and with the utmost calmness of demeanour."
"“You are excitable,
perhaps as the result of your solitary life."
"If you would make up your
mind to live more among your fellows in society, I trust, I am sure,
that the world would be glad to welcome you, as a remarkable young man;
and you would soon find yourself able to look at things more calmly."
"You
would see that all these things are much simpler than you think; and,
besides, these rare cases come about, in my opinion, from ennui and from
satiety.”

“Exactly, exactly!"
That is a true thought!” cried the prince.
"“From
ennui, from our ennui but not from satiety!"
"Oh, no, you are wrong there!"
Say from _thirst_ if you like; the thirst of fever!
"And please do not
suppose that this is so small a matter that we may have a laugh at it
and dismiss it; we must be able to foresee our disasters and arm against
them."
"We Russians no sooner arrive at the brink of the water, and
realize that we are really at the brink, than we are so delighted with
the outlook that in we plunge and swim to the farthest point we can
see."
Why is this?
"You say you are surprised at Pavlicheff’s action; you
ascribe it to madness, to kindness of heart, and what not, but it is not
so."
"“Our Russian intensity not only astonishes ourselves; all Europe wonders
at our conduct in such cases!"
"For, if one of us goes over to Roman
Catholicism, he is sure to become a Jesuit at once, and a rabid one into
the bargain."
"If one of us becomes an Atheist, he must needs begin to
insist on the prohibition of faith in God by force, that is, by the
sword."
Why is this?
Why does he then exceed all bounds at once?
"Because
he has found land at last, the fatherland that he sought in vain before;
and, because his soul is rejoiced to find it, he throws himself upon it
and kisses it!"
"Oh, it is not from vanity alone, it is not from feelings
of vanity that Russians become Atheists and Jesuits!"
"But from spiritual
thirst, from anguish of longing for higher things, for dry firm land,
for foothold on a fatherland which they never believed in because they
never knew it."
"It is easier for a Russian to become an Atheist, than for
any other nationality in the world."
"And not only does a Russian ‘become
an Atheist,’ but he actually _believes in_ Atheism, just as though he
had found a new faith, not perceiving that he has pinned his faith to
a negation."
Such is our anguish of thirst!
"‘Whoso has no country has no
God.’ That is not my own expression; it is the expression of a merchant,
one of the Old Believers, whom I once met while travelling."
"He did not
say exactly these words."
"I think his expression was:

“‘Whoso forsakes his country forsakes his God.’

“But let these thirsty Russian souls find, like Columbus’ discoverers, a
new world; let them find the Russian world, let them search and discover
all the gold and treasure that lies hid in the bosom of their own land!"
"Show them the restitution of lost humanity, in the future, by Russian
thought alone, and by means of the God and of the Christ of our Russian
faith, and you will see how mighty and just and wise and good a giant
will rise up before the eyes of the astonished and frightened world;
astonished because they expect nothing but the sword from us, because
they think they will get nothing out of us but barbarism."
"This has
been the case up to now, and the longer matters go on as they are now
proceeding, the more clear will be the truth of what I say; and I--”

But at this moment something happened which put a most unexpected end to
the orator’s speech."
"All this heated tirade, this outflow of passionate
words and ecstatic ideas which seemed to hustle and tumble over each
other as they fell from his lips, bore evidence of some unusually
disturbed mental condition in the young fellow who had “boiled over” in
such a remarkable manner, without any apparent reason."
"Of those who were present, such as knew the prince listened to his
outburst in a state of alarm, some with a feeling of mortification."
"It
was so unlike his usual timid self-constraint; so inconsistent with his
usual taste and tact, and with his instinctive feeling for the higher
proprieties."
"They could not understand the origin of the outburst; it
could not be simply the news of Pavlicheff’s perversion."
"By the ladies
the prince was regarded as little better than a lunatic, and Princess
Bielokonski admitted afterwards that “in another minute she would have
bolted.”

The two old gentlemen looked quite alarmed."
"The old general (Epanchin’s
chief) sat and glared at the prince in severe displeasure."
"The colonel
sat immovable."
"Even the German poet grew a little pale, though he wore
his usual artificial smile as he looked around to see what the others
would do."
"In point of fact it is quite possible that the matter would have ended
in a very commonplace and natural way in a few minutes."
"The undoubtedly
astonished, but now more collected, General Epanchin had several times
endeavoured to interrupt the prince, and not having succeeded he was now
preparing to take firmer and more vigorous measures to attain his end."
"In another minute or two he would probably have made up his mind to lead
the prince quietly out of the room, on the plea of his being ill (and it
was more than likely that the general was right in his belief that the
prince _was_ actually ill), but it so happened that destiny had something
different in store."
"At the beginning of the evening, when the prince first came into the
room, he had sat down as far as possible from the Chinese vase which
Aglaya had spoken of the day before."
"Will it be believed that, after Aglaya’s alarming words, an ineradicable
conviction had taken possession of his mind that, however he might try
to avoid this vase next day, he must certainly break it?"
But so it was.
"During the evening other impressions began to awaken in his mind, as
we have seen, and he forgot his presentiment."
"But when Pavlicheff was
mentioned and the general introduced him to Ivan Petrovitch, he had
changed his place, and went over nearer to the table; when, it so
happened, he took the chair nearest to the beautiful vase, which stood
on a pedestal behind him, just about on a level with his elbow."
"As he spoke his last words he had risen suddenly from his seat with a
wave of his arm, and there was a general cry of horror."
"The huge vase swayed backwards and forwards; it seemed to be uncertain
whether or no to topple over on to the head of one of the old men,
but eventually determined to go the other way, and came crashing over
towards the German poet, who darted out of the way in terror."
"The crash, the cry, the sight of the fragments of valuable china
covering the carpet, the alarm of the company--what all this meant
to the poor prince it would be difficult to convey to the mind of the
reader, or for him to imagine."
"But one very curious fact was that all the shame and vexation and
mortification which he felt over the accident were less powerful than
the deep impression of the almost supernatural truth of his premonition."
"He stood still in alarm--in almost superstitious alarm, for a moment;
then all mists seemed to clear away from his eyes; he was conscious of
nothing but light and joy and ecstasy; his breath came and went; but
the moment passed."
Thank God it was not that!
"He drew a long breath and
looked around."
"For some minutes he did not seem to comprehend the excitement around
him; that is, he comprehended it and saw everything, but he stood aside,
as it were, like someone invisible in a fairy tale, as though he had
nothing to do with what was going on, though it pleased him to take an
interest in it."
"He saw them gather up the broken bits of china; he heard the loud
talking of the guests and observed how pale Aglaya looked, and how very
strangely she was gazing at him."
"There was no hatred in her expression,
and no anger whatever."
"It was full of alarm for him, and sympathy and
affection, while she looked around at the others with flashing, angry
eyes."
His heart filled with a sweet pain as he gazed at her.
"At length he observed, to his amazement, that all had taken their seats
again, and were laughing and talking as though nothing had happened."
"Another minute and the laughter grew louder--they were laughing at him,
at his dumb stupor--laughing kindly and merrily."
"Several of them
spoke to him, and spoke so kindly and cordially, especially Lizabetha
Prokofievna--she was saying the kindest possible things to him."
"Suddenly he became aware that General Epanchin was tapping him on the
shoulder; Ivan Petrovitch was laughing too, but still more kind and
sympathizing was the old dignitary."
"He took the prince by the hand and
pressed it warmly; then he patted it, and quietly urged him to recollect
himself--speaking to him exactly as he would have spoken to a little
frightened child, which pleased the prince wonderfully; and next seated
him beside himself."
"The prince gazed into his face with pleasure, but still seemed to have
no power to speak."
His breath failed him.
"The old man’s face pleased him
greatly."
“Do you really forgive me?” he said at last.
"“And--and Lizabetha
Prokofievna too?” The laugh increased, tears came into the prince’s
eyes, he could not believe in all this kindness--he was enchanted."
“The vase certainly was a very beautiful one.
"I remember it here for
fifteen years--yes, quite that!” remarked Ivan Petrovitch."
"“Oh, what a dreadful calamity!"
"A wretched vase smashed, and a man half
dead with remorse about it,” said Lizabetha Prokofievna, loudly."
"“What
made you so dreadfully startled, Lef Nicolaievitch?” she added, a little
timidly."
"“Come, my dear boy!"
cheer up.
"You really alarm me, taking the
accident so to heart.”

“Do you forgive me all--_all_, besides the vase, I mean?” said the prince,
rising from his seat once more, but the old gentleman caught his hand
and drew him down again--he seemed unwilling to let him go."
"“_C’est très-curieux et c’est très-sérieux_,” he whispered across the
table to Ivan Petrovitch, rather loudly."
Probably the prince heard him.
“So that I have not offended any of you?
"You will not believe how happy
I am to be able to think so."
It is as it should be.
"As if I _could_ offend
anyone here!"
"I should offend you again by even suggesting such a thing.”

“Calm yourself, my dear fellow."
"You are exaggerating again; you really
have no occasion to be so grateful to us."
"It is a feeling which does you
great credit, but an exaggeration, for all that.”

“I am not exactly thanking you, I am only feeling a growing admiration
for you--it makes me happy to look at you."
"I dare say I am speaking very
foolishly, but I must speak--I must explain, if it be out of nothing
better than self-respect.”

All he said and did was abrupt, confused, feverish--very likely the
words he spoke, as often as not, were not those he wished to say."
"He
seemed to inquire whether he _might_ speak."
"His eyes lighted on Princess
Bielokonski."
"“All right, my friend, talk away, talk away!” she remarked."
"“Only don’t
lose your breath; you were in such a hurry when you began, and look what
you’ve come to now!"
"Don’t be afraid of speaking--all these ladies
and gentlemen have seen far stranger people than yourself; you don’t
astonish _them_."
"You are nothing out-of-the-way remarkable, you know."
"You’ve done nothing but break a vase, and give us all a fright.”

The prince listened, smiling."
"“Wasn’t it you,” he said, suddenly turning to the old gentleman, “who
saved the student Porkunoff and a clerk called Shoabrin from being sent
to Siberia, two or three months since?”

The old dignitary blushed a little, and murmured that the prince had
better not excite himself further."
"“And I have heard of _you_,” continued the prince, addressing Ivan
Petrovitch, “that when some of your villagers were burned out you gave
them wood to build up their houses again, though they were no longer
your serfs and had behaved badly towards you.”

“Oh, come, come!"
"You are exaggerating,” said Ivan Petrovitch, beaming
with satisfaction, all the same."
"He was right, however, in this
instance, for the report had reached the prince’s ears in an incorrect
form."
"“And you, princess,” he went on, addressing Princess Bielokonski, “was
it not you who received me in Moscow, six months since, as kindly as
though I had been your own son, in response to a letter from Lizabetha
Prokofievna; and gave me one piece of advice, again as to your own son,
which I shall never forget?"
"Do you remember?”

“What are you making such a fuss about?” said the old lady, with
annoyance."
"“You are a good fellow, but very silly."
"One gives you a
halfpenny, and you are as grateful as though one had saved your life."
"You think this is praiseworthy on your part, but it is not--it is not,
indeed.”

She seemed to be very angry, but suddenly burst out laughing, quite
good-humouredly."
"Lizabetha Prokofievna’s face brightened up, too; so did that of General
Epanchin."
"“I told you Lef Nicolaievitch was a man--a man--if only he would not
be in such a hurry, as the princess remarked,” said the latter, with
delight."
"Aglaya alone seemed sad and depressed; her face was flushed, perhaps
with indignation."
"“He really is very charming,” whispered the old dignitary to Ivan
Petrovitch."
"“I came into this room with anguish in my heart,” continued the prince,
with ever-growing agitation, speaking quicker and quicker, and with
increasing strangeness."
"“I--I was afraid of you all, and afraid of
myself."
I was most afraid of myself.
"When I returned to Petersburg, I
promised myself to make a point of seeing our greatest men, and members
of our oldest families--the old families like my own."
"I am now among
princes like myself, am I not?"
"I wished to know you, and it was
necessary, very, very necessary."
"I had always heard so much that was
evil said of you all--more evil than good; as to how small and petty
were your interests, how absurd your habits, how shallow your education,
and so on."
There is so much written and said about you!
"I came here
today with anxious curiosity; I wished to see for myself and form my
own convictions as to whether it were true that the whole of this upper
stratum of Russian society is _worthless_, has outlived its time, has
existed too long, and is only fit to die--and yet is dying with petty,
spiteful warring against that which is destined to supersede it and take
its place--hindering the Coming Men, and knowing not that itself is in
a dying condition."
"I did not fully believe in this view even before, for
there never was such a class among us--excepting perhaps at court, by
accident--or by uniform; but now there is not even that, is there?"
"It
has vanished, has it not?”

“No, not a bit of it,” said Ivan Petrovitch, with a sarcastic laugh."
"“Good Lord, he’s off again!” said Princess Bielokonski, impatiently."
“Laissez-le dire!
"He is trembling all over,” said the old man, in a
warning whisper."
The prince certainly was beside himself.
“Well?
What have I seen?” he continued.
"“I have seen men of graceful
simplicity of intellect; I have seen an old man who is not above
speaking kindly and even _listening_ to a boy like myself; I see before
me persons who can understand, who can forgive--kind, good Russian
hearts--hearts almost as kind and cordial as I met abroad."
"Imagine how
delighted I must have been, and how surprised!"
"Oh, let me express
this feeling!"
"I have so often heard, and I have even believed, that
in society there was nothing but empty forms, and that reality had
vanished; but I now see for myself that this can never be the case _here_,
among us--it may be the order elsewhere, but not in Russia."
"Surely you
are not all Jesuits and deceivers!"
I heard Prince N.’s story just now.
"Was it not simple-minded, spontaneous humour?"
"Could such words come from
the lips of a man who is dead?--a man whose heart and talents are dried
up?"
"Could dead men and women have treated me so kindly as you have all
been treating me to-day?"
"Is there not material for the future in all
this--for hope?"
"Can such people fail to _understand?_ Can such men fall
away from reality?”

“Once more let us beg you to be calm, my dear boy."
"We’ll talk of all
this another time--I shall do so with the greatest pleasure, for one,”
 said the old dignitary, with a smile."
Ivan Petrovitch grunted and twisted round in his chair.
"General Epanchin
moved nervously."
"The latter’s chief had started a conversation with the
wife of the dignitary, and took no notice whatever of the prince, but
the old lady very often glanced at him, and listened to what he was
saying."
"“No, I had better speak,” continued the prince, with a new outburst
of feverish emotion, and turning towards the old man with an air of
confidential trustfulness."
"“Yesterday, Aglaya Ivanovna forbade me
to talk, and even specified the particular subjects I must not touch
upon--she knows well enough that I am odd when I get upon these matters."
"I am nearly twenty-seven years old, and yet I know I am little better
than a child."
"I have no right to express my ideas, and said so long ago."
"Only in Moscow, with Rogojin, did I ever speak absolutely freely!"
"He and
I read Pushkin together--all his works."
"Rogojin knew nothing of Pushkin,
had not even heard his name."
"I am always afraid of spoiling a great
Thought or Idea by my absurd manner."
"I have no eloquence, I know."
"I
always make the wrong gestures--inappropriate gestures--and therefore
I degrade the Thought, and raise a laugh instead of doing my subject
justice."
"I have no sense of proportion either, and that is the chief
thing."
"I know it would be much better if I were always to sit still and
say nothing."
"When I do so, I appear to be quite a sensible sort of a
person, and what’s more, I think about things."
"But now I must speak; it
is better that I should."
"I began to speak because you looked so kindly
at me; you have such a beautiful face."
"I promised Aglaya Ivanovna
yesterday that I would not speak all the evening.”

“Really?” said the old man, smiling."
"“But, at times, I can’t help thinking that I am wrong in feeling so
about it, you know."
"Sincerity is more important than elocution, isn’t
it?”

“Sometimes.”

“I want to explain all to you--everything--everything!"
"I know you think
me Utopian, don’t you--an idealist?"
"Oh, no!"
"I’m not, indeed--my ideas
are all so simple."
You don’t believe me?
You are smiling.
"Do you know,
I am sometimes very wicked--for I lose my faith?"
"This evening as I came
here, I thought to myself, ‘What shall I talk about?"
"How am I to begin,
so that they may be able to understand partially, at all events?’ How
afraid I was--dreadfully afraid!"
"And yet, how _could_ I be afraid--was it
not shameful of me?"
"Was I afraid of finding a bottomless abyss of empty
selfishness?"
Ah!
"that’s why I am so happy at this moment, because I find
there is no bottomless abyss at all--but good, healthy material, full of
life."
"“It is not such a very dreadful circumstance that we are odd people, is
it?"
"For we really are odd, you know--careless, reckless, easily wearied
of anything."
"We don’t look thoroughly into matters--don’t care to
understand things."
"We are all like this--you and I, and all of them!"
"Why, here are you, now--you are not a bit angry with me for calling you
‘odd,’ are you?"
"And, if so, surely there is good material in you?"
"Do you
know, I sometimes think it is a good thing to be odd."
"We can forgive
one another more easily, and be more humble."
"No one can begin by being
perfect--there is much one cannot understand in life at first."
"In order
to attain to perfection, one must begin by failing to understand much."
"And if we take in knowledge too quickly, we very likely are not taking
it in at all."
"I say all this to you--you who by this time understand so
much--and doubtless have failed to understand so much, also."
"I am not
afraid of you any longer."
"You are not angry that a mere boy should say
such words to you, are you?"
Of course not!
"You know how to forget and to
forgive."
"You are laughing, Ivan Petrovitch?"
"You think I am a champion
of other classes of people--that I am _their_ advocate, a democrat, and
an orator of Equality?” The prince laughed hysterically; he had several
times burst into these little, short nervous laughs."
"“Oh, no--it is for
you, for myself, and for all of us together, that I am alarmed."
"I am a
prince of an old family myself, and I am sitting among my peers; and I
am talking like this in the hope of saving us all; in the hope that our
class will not disappear altogether--into the darkness--unguessing its
danger--blaming everything around it, and losing ground every day."
"Why
should we disappear and give place to others, when we may still, if
we choose, remain in the front rank and lead the battle?"
"Let us be
servants, that we may become lords in due season!”

He tried to get upon his feet again, but the old man still restrained
him, gazing at him with increasing perturbation as he went on."
“Listen--I know it is best not to speak!
"It is best simply to give a
good example--simply to begin the work."
"I have done this--I have
begun, and--and--oh!"
"_can_ anyone be unhappy, really?"
Oh!
"what does grief
matter--what does misfortune matter, if one knows how to be happy?"
"Do
you know, I cannot understand how anyone can pass by a green tree, and
not feel happy only to look at it!"
"How anyone can talk to a man and not
feel happy in loving him!"
"Oh, it is my own fault that I cannot express
myself well enough!"
"But there are lovely things at every step I
take--things which even the most miserable man must recognize as
beautiful."
"Look at a little child--look at God’s day dawn--look at the
grass growing--look at the eyes that love you, as they gaze back into
your eyes!”

He had risen, and was speaking standing up."
"The old gentleman was
looking at him now in unconcealed alarm."
"Lizabetha Prokofievna wrung her
hands."
"“Oh, my God!” she cried."
"She had guessed the state of the case
before anyone else."
"Aglaya rushed quickly up to him, and was just in time to receive him in
her arms, and to hear with dread and horror that awful, wild cry as he
fell writhing to the ground."
"There he lay on the carpet, and someone quickly placed a cushion under
his head."
No one had expected this.
"In a quarter of an hour or so Prince N. and Evgenie Pavlovitch and the
old dignitary were hard at work endeavouring to restore the harmony
of the evening, but it was of no avail, and very soon after the guests
separated and went their ways."
"A great deal of sympathy was expressed; a considerable amount of advice
was volunteered; Ivan Petrovitch expressed his opinion that the young
man was “a Slavophile, or something of that sort”; but that it was not a
dangerous development."
The old dignitary said nothing.
"True enough, most of the guests, next day and the day after, were not
in very good humour."
"Ivan Petrovitch was a little offended, but not
seriously so."
"General Epanchin’s chief was rather cool towards him for
some while after the occurrence."
"The old dignitary, as patron of the
family, took the opportunity of murmuring some kind of admonition to the
general, and added, in flattering terms, that he was most interested
in Aglaya’s future."
"He was a man who really did possess a kind heart,
although his interest in the prince, in the earlier part of the evening,
was due, among other reasons, to the latter’s connection with Nastasia
Philipovna, according to popular report."
"He had heard a good deal of
this story here and there, and was greatly interested in it, so much so
that he longed to ask further questions about it."
"Princess Bielokonski, as she drove away on this eventful evening, took
occasion to say to Lizabetha Prokofievna:

“Well--he’s a good match--and a bad one; and if you want my opinion,
more bad than good."
"You can see for yourself the man is an invalid.”

Lizabetha therefore decided that the prince was impossible as a husband
for Aglaya; and during the ensuing night she made a vow that never while
she lived should he marry Aglaya."
"With this resolve firmly impressed
upon her mind, she awoke next day; but during the morning, after her
early lunch, she fell into a condition of remarkable inconsistency."
"In reply to a very guarded question of her sisters’, Aglaya had answered
coldly, but exceedingly haughtily:

“I have never given him my word at all, nor have I ever counted him as
my future husband--never in my life."
"He is just as little to me as all
the rest.”

Lizabetha Prokofievna suddenly flared up."
"“I did not expect that of you, Aglaya,” she said."
"“He is an impossible
husband for you,--I know it; and thank God that we agree upon that
point; but I did not expect to hear such words from you."
"I thought I
should hear a very different tone from you."
"I would have turned out
everyone who was in the room last night and kept him,--that’s the sort
of man he is, in my opinion!”

Here she suddenly paused, afraid of what she had just said."
"But she
little knew how unfair she was to her daughter at that moment."
"It was
all settled in Aglaya’s mind."
"She was only waiting for the hour that
would bring the matter to a final climax; and every hint, every careless
probing of her wound, did but further lacerate her heart."
VIII.
"This same morning dawned for the prince pregnant with no less painful
presentiments,--which fact his physical state was, of course, quite
enough to account for; but he was so indefinably melancholy,--his
sadness could not attach itself to anything in particular, and this
tormented him more than anything else."
"Of course certain facts stood
before him, clear and painful, but his sadness went beyond all that he
could remember or imagine; he realized that he was powerless to console
himself unaided."
"Little by little he began to develop the expectation
that this day something important, something decisive, was to happen to
him."
His attack of yesterday had been a slight one.
"Excepting some little
heaviness in the head and pain in the limbs, he did not feel any
particular effects."
"His brain worked all right, though his soul was
heavy within him."
"He rose late, and immediately upon waking remembered all about the
previous evening; he also remembered, though not quite so clearly, how,
half an hour after his fit, he had been carried home."
"He soon heard that a messenger from the Epanchins’ had already been to
inquire after him."
"At half-past eleven another arrived; and this pleased
him."
"Vera Lebedeff was one of the first to come to see him and offer her
services."
"No sooner did she catch sight of him than she burst into
tears; but when he tried to soothe her she began to laugh."
"He was quite
struck by the girl’s deep sympathy for him; he seized her hand and
kissed it."
Vera flushed crimson.
"“Oh, don’t, don’t!” she exclaimed in alarm, snatching her hand away."
"She
went hastily out of the room in a state of strange confusion."
"Lebedeff also came to see the prince, in a great hurry to get away to
the “deceased,” as he called General Ivolgin, who was alive still, but
very ill. Colia also turned up, and begged the prince for pity’s sake to
tell him all he knew about his father which had been concealed from him
till now."
"He said he had found out nearly everything since yesterday;
the poor boy was in a state of deep affliction."
"With all the sympathy
which he could bring into play, the prince told Colia the whole story
without reserve, detailing the facts as clearly as he could."
"The
tale struck Colia like a thunderbolt."
He could not speak.
"He listened
silently, and cried softly to himself the while."
"The prince perceived
that this was an impression which would last for the whole of the boy’s
life."
"He made haste to explain his view of the matter, and pointed out
that the old man’s approaching death was probably brought on by horror
at the thought of his action; and that it was not everyone who was
capable of such a feeling."
Colia’s eyes flashed as he listened.
“Gania and Varia and Ptitsin are a worthless lot!
"I shall not quarrel
with them; but from this moment our feet shall not travel the same road."
"Oh, prince, I have felt much that is quite new to me since yesterday!"
It is a lesson for me.
"I shall now consider my mother as entirely my
responsibility; though she may be safe enough with Varia."
"Still, meat
and drink is not everything.”

He jumped up and hurried off, remembering suddenly that he was wanted
at his father’s bedside; but before he went out of the room he inquired
hastily after the prince’s health, and receiving the latter’s reply,
added:

“Isn’t there something else, prince?"
"I heard yesterday, but I have
no right to talk about this..."
"If you ever want a true friend and
servant--neither you nor I are so very happy, are we?--come to me."
"I
won’t ask you questions, though.”

He ran off and left the prince more dejected than ever."
"Everyone seemed to be speaking prophetically, hinting at some misfortune
or sorrow to come; they had all looked at him as though they knew
something which he did not know."
"Lebedeff had asked questions, Colia had
hinted, and Vera had shed tears."
What was it?
"At last, with a sigh of annoyance, he said to himself that it was
nothing but his own cursed sickly suspicion."
"His face lighted up with
joy when, at about two o’clock, he espied the Epanchins coming along to
pay him a short visit, “just for a minute.” They really had only come
for a minute."
"Lizabetha Prokofievna had announced, directly after lunch, that they
would all take a walk together."
"The information was given in the form of
a command, without explanation, drily and abruptly."
"All had issued forth
in obedience to the mandate; that is, the girls, mamma, and Prince S.
Lizabetha Prokofievna went off in a direction exactly contrary to the
usual one, and all understood very well what she was driving at, but
held their peace, fearing to irritate the good lady."
"She, as though
anxious to avoid any conversation, walked ahead, silent and alone."
"At
last Adelaida remarked that it was no use racing along at such a pace,
and that she could not keep up with her mother."
"“Look here,” said Lizabetha Prokofievna, turning round suddenly; “we are
passing his house."
"Whatever Aglaya may think, and in spite of anything
that may happen, he is not a stranger to us; besides which, he is ill
and in misfortune."
"I, for one, shall call in and see him."
"Let anyone
follow me who cares to.”

Of course every one of them followed her."
"The prince hastened to apologize, very properly, for yesterday’s mishap
with the vase, and for the scene generally."
"“Oh, that’s nothing,” replied Lizabetha; “I’m not sorry for the vase,
I’m sorry for you."
H’m!
"so you can see that there was a ‘scene,’ can
you?"
"Well, it doesn’t matter much, for everyone must realize now that it
is impossible to be hard on you."
"Well, _au revoir_."
"I advise you to have
a walk, and then go to sleep again if you can."
"Come in as usual, if
you feel inclined; and be assured, once for all, whatever happens, and
whatever may have happened, you shall always remain the friend of the
family--mine, at all events."
"I can answer for myself.”

In response to this challenge all the others chimed in and re-echoed
mamma’s sentiments."
"And so they took their departure; but in this hasty and kindly designed
visit there was hidden a fund of cruelty which Lizabetha Prokofievna
never dreamed of."
"In the words “as usual,” and again in her added,
“mine, at all events,” there seemed an ominous knell of some evil to
come."
The prince began to think of Aglaya.
"She had certainly given him a
wonderful smile, both at coming and again at leave-taking, but had not
said a word, not even when the others all professed their friendship for
him."
"She had looked very intently at him, but that was all."
"Her face had
been paler than usual; she looked as though she had slept badly."
"The prince made up his mind that he would make a point of going there
“as usual,” tonight, and looked feverishly at his watch."
Vera came in three minutes after the Epanchins had left.
"“Lef
Nicolaievitch,” she said, “Aglaya Ivanovna has just given me a message
for you.”

The prince trembled."
"“Is it a note?”

“No, a verbal message; she had hardly time even for that."
"She begs you
earnestly not to go out of the house for a single moment all to-day,
until seven o’clock in the evening."
"It may have been nine; I didn’t
quite hear.”

“But--but, why is this?"
"What does it mean?”

“I don’t know at all; but she said I was to tell you particularly.”

“Did she say that?”

“Not those very words."
"She only just had time to whisper as she went by;
but by the way she looked at me I knew it was important."
"She looked at
me in a way that made my heart stop beating.”

The prince asked a few more questions, and though he learned nothing
else, he became more and more agitated."
"Left alone, he lay down on the sofa, and began to think."
"“Perhaps,” he thought, “someone is to be with them until nine tonight
and she is afraid that I may come and make a fool of myself again, in
public.” So he spent his time longing for the evening and looking at his
watch."
"But the clearing-up of the mystery came long before the evening,
and came in the form of a new and agonizing riddle."
"Half an hour after the Epanchins had gone, Hippolyte arrived, so tired
that, almost unconscious, he sank into a chair, and broke into such a
fit of coughing that he could not stop."
He coughed till the blood came.
"His eyes glittered, and two red spots on his cheeks grew brighter and
brighter."
"The prince murmured something to him, but Hippolyte only
signed that he must be left alone for a while, and sat silent."
"At last
he came to himself."
"“I am off,” he said, hoarsely, and with difficulty."
"“Shall I see you home?” asked the prince, rising from his seat, but
suddenly stopping short as he remembered Aglaya’s prohibition against
leaving the house."
Hippolyte laughed.
"“I don’t mean that I am going to leave your house,” he continued,
still gasping and coughing."
"“On the contrary, I thought it absolutely
necessary to come and see you; otherwise I should not have troubled you."
"I am off there, you know, and this time I believe, seriously, that I am
off!"
It’s all over.
"I did not come here for sympathy, believe me."
"I lay
down this morning at ten o’clock with the intention of not rising again
before that time; but I thought it over and rose just once more in
order to come here; from which you may deduce that I had some reason for
wishing to come.”

“It grieves me to see you so, Hippolyte."
"Why didn’t you send me a
message?"
"I would have come up and saved you this trouble.”

“Well, well!"
Enough!
"You’ve pitied me, and that’s all that good manners
exact."
"I forgot, how are you?”

“I’m all right; yesterday I was a little--”

“I know, I heard; the china vase caught it!"
I’m sorry I wasn’t there.
I’ve come about something important.
"In the first place I had, the
pleasure of seeing Gavrila Ardalionovitch and Aglaya Ivanovna enjoying a
rendezvous on the green bench in the park."
"I was astonished to see what
a fool a man can look."
"I remarked upon the fact to Aglaya Ivanovna when
he had gone."
"I don’t think anything ever surprises you, prince!” added
Hippolyte, gazing incredulously at the prince’s calm demeanour."
"“To be
astonished by nothing is a sign, they say, of a great intellect."
"In my
opinion it would serve equally well as a sign of great foolishness."
"I
am not hinting about you; pardon me!"
"I am very unfortunate today in my
expressions.”

“I knew yesterday that Gavrila Ardalionovitch--” began the prince, and
paused in evident confusion, though Hippolyte had shown annoyance at his
betraying no surprise."
“You knew it?
"Come, that’s news!"
But no--perhaps better not tell me.
"And
were you a witness of the meeting?”

“If you were there yourself you must have known that I was _not_ there!”

“Oh!"
but you may have been sitting behind the bushes somewhere.
"However,
I am very glad, on your account, of course."
"I was beginning to be afraid
that Mr. Gania--might have the preference!”

“May I ask you, Hippolyte, not to talk of this subject?"
"And not to use
such expressions?”

“Especially as you know all, eh?”

“You are wrong."
"I know scarcely anything, and Aglaya Ivanovna is aware
that I know nothing."
I knew nothing whatever about this meeting.
"You say
there was a meeting."
"Very well; let’s leave it so--”

“Why, what do you mean?"
"You said you knew, and now suddenly you know
nothing!"
"You say ‘very well; let’s leave it so.’ But I say, don’t be
so confiding, especially as you know nothing."
"You are confiding simply
_because_ you know nothing."
"But do you know what these good people have
in their minds’ eye--Gania and his sister?"
Perhaps you are suspicious?
"Well, well, I’ll drop the subject!” he added, hastily, observing the
prince’s impatient gesture."
"“But I’ve come to you on my own business;
I wish to make you a clear explanation."
"What a nuisance it is that one
cannot die without explanations!"
"I have made such a quantity of them
already."
"Do you wish to hear what I have to say?”

“Speak away, I am listening.”

“Very well, but I’ll change my mind, and begin about Gania."
"Just fancy
to begin with, if you can, that I, too, was given an appointment at
the green bench today!"
"However, I won’t deceive you; I asked for the
appointment."
I said I had a secret to disclose.
"I don’t know whether I
came there too early, I think I must have; but scarcely had I sat down
beside Aglaya Ivanovna than I saw Gavrila Ardalionovitch and his sister
Varia coming along, arm in arm, just as though they were enjoying a
morning walk together."
"Both of them seemed very much astonished, not
to say disturbed, at seeing me; they evidently had not expected
the pleasure."
"Aglaya Ivanovna blushed up, and was actually a little
confused."
"I don’t know whether it was merely because I was there, or
whether Gania’s beauty was too much for her!"
"But anyway, she turned
crimson, and then finished up the business in a very funny manner."
"She jumped up from her seat, bowed back to Gania, smiled to Varia, and
suddenly observed: ‘I only came here to express my gratitude for all
your kind wishes on my behalf, and to say that if I find I need your
services, believe me--’ Here she bowed them away, as it were, and they
both marched off again, looking very foolish."
"Gania evidently could not
make head nor tail of the matter, and turned as red as a lobster; but
Varia understood at once that they must get away as quickly as they
could, so she dragged Gania away; she is a great deal cleverer than he
is."
"As for myself, I went there to arrange a meeting to be held between
Aglaya Ivanovna and Nastasia Philipovna.”

“Nastasia Philipovna!” cried the prince."
“Aha!
"I think you are growing less cool, my friend, and are beginning
to be a trifle surprised, aren’t you?"
"I’m glad that you are not above
ordinary human feelings, for once."
"I’ll console you a little now, after
your consternation."
"See what I get for serving a young and high-souled
maiden!"
"This morning I received a slap in the face from the lady!”

“A--a moral one?” asked the prince, involuntarily."
“Yes--not a physical one!
"I don’t suppose anyone--even a woman--would
raise a hand against me now."
Even Gania would hesitate!
"I did think at
one time yesterday, that he would fly at me, though."
"I bet anything that
I know what you are thinking of now!"
"You are thinking: ‘Of course one
can’t strike the little wretch, but one could suffocate him with a
pillow, or a wet towel, when he is asleep!"
"One _ought_ to get rid of him
somehow.’ I can see in your face that you are thinking that at this very
second.”

“I never thought of such a thing for a moment,” said the prince, with
disgust."
"“I don’t know--I dreamed last night that I was being suffocated with a
wet cloth by--somebody."
I’ll tell you who it was--Rogojin!
"What do you
think, can a man be suffocated with a wet cloth?”

“I don’t know.”

“I’ve heard so."
"Well, we’ll leave that question just now."
"Why am I a
scandal-monger?"
Why did she call me a scandal-monger?
"And mind, _after_
she had heard every word I had to tell her, and had asked all sorts of
questions besides--but such is the way of women."
"For _her_ sake I entered
into relations with Rogojin--an interesting man!"
"At _her_ request I
arranged a personal interview between herself and Nastasia Philipovna."
"Could she have been angry because I hinted that she was enjoying
Nastasia Philipovna’s ‘leavings’?"
"Why, I have been impressing it upon
her all this while for her own good."
"Two letters have I written her in
that strain, and I began straight off today about its being humiliating
for her."
"Besides, the word ‘leavings’ is not my invention."
"At all
events, they all used it at Gania’s, and she used it herself."
"So why am
I a scandal-monger?"
"I see--I see you are tremendously amused, at this
moment!"
"Probably you are laughing at me and fitting those silly lines to
my case--

“‘Maybe sad Love upon his setting smiles, And with vain hopes his
farewell hour beguiles.’

“Ha, ha, ha!”

Hippolyte suddenly burst into a fit of hysterical laughter, which turned
into a choking cough."
"“Observe,” he gasped, through his coughing, “what a fellow Gania is!"
"He talks about Nastasia’s ‘leavings,’ but what does he want to take
himself?”

The prince sat silent for a long while."
"His mind was filled with dread
and horror."
"“You spoke of a meeting with Nastasia Philipovna,” he said at last, in a
low voice."
“Oh--come!
"Surely you must know that there is to be a meeting today
between Nastasia and Aglaya Ivanovna, and that Nastasia has been sent
for on purpose, through Rogojin, from St. Petersburg?"
"It has been
brought about by invitation of Aglaya Ivanovna and my own efforts, and
Nastasia is at this moment with Rogojin, not far from here--at Dana
Alexeyevna’s--that curious friend of hers; and to this questionable
house Aglaya Ivanovna is to proceed for a friendly chat with Nastasia
Philipovna, and for the settlement of several problems."
"They are going
to play at arithmetic--didn’t you know about it?"
"Word of honour?”

“It’s a most improbable story.”

“Oh, very well!"
if it’s improbable--it is--that’s all!
"And yet--where
should you have heard it?"
"Though I must say, if a fly crosses the room
it’s known all over the place here."
"However, I’ve warned you, and you
may be grateful to me."
Well--_au revoir_--probably in the next world!
"One
more thing--don’t think that I am telling you all this for your sake."
"Oh, dear, no!"
"Do you know that I dedicated my confession to Aglaya
Ivanovna?"
"I did though, and how she took it, ha, ha!"
"Oh, no!"
"I am not
acting from any high, exalted motives."
"But though I may have behaved
like a cad to you, I have not done _her_ any harm."
"I don’t apologize for
my words about ‘leavings’ and all that."
"I am atoning for that, you
see, by telling you the place and time of the meeting."
Goodbye!
"You
had better take your measures, if you are worthy the name of a man!"
"The
meeting is fixed for this evening--that’s certain.”

Hippolyte walked towards the door, but the prince called him back and he
stopped."
"“Then you think Aglaya Ivanovna herself intends to go to Nastasia
Philipovna’s tonight?” he asked, and bright hectic spots came out on his
cheeks and forehead."
"“I don’t know absolutely for certain; but in all probability it is so,”
 replied Hippolyte, looking round."
"“Nastasia would hardly go to her; and
they can’t meet at Gania’s, with a man nearly dead in the house.”

“It’s impossible, for that very reason,” said the prince."
"“How would she
get out if she wished to?"
"You don’t know the habits of that house--she
_could_ not get away alone to Nastasia Philipovna’s!"
"It’s all nonsense!”

“Look here, my dear prince, no one jumps out of the window if they can
help it; but when there’s a fire, the dandiest gentleman or the finest
lady in the world will skip out!"
"When the moment comes, and
there’s nothing else to be done--our young lady will go to Nastasia
Philipovna’s!"
"Don’t they let the young ladies out of the house alone,
then?”

“I didn’t mean that exactly.”

“If you didn’t mean that, then she has only to go down the steps and
walk off, and she need never come back unless she chooses: Ships are
burned behind one sometimes, and one doesn’t care to return whence one
came."
"Life need not consist only of lunches, and dinners, and Prince
S’s."
"It strikes me you take Aglaya Ivanovna for some conventional
boarding-school girl."
"I said so to her, and she quite agreed with me."
Wait till seven or eight o’clock.
"In your place I would send someone
there to keep watch, so as to seize the exact moment when she steps out
of the house."
Send Colia.
"He’ll play the spy with pleasure--for you at
least."
"Ha, ha, ha!”

Hippolyte went out."
"There was no reason for the prince to set anyone to watch, even if he
had been capable of such a thing."
"Aglaya’s command that he should stay
at home all day seemed almost explained now."
"Perhaps she meant to call
for him, herself, or it might be, of course, that she was anxious to
make sure of his not coming there, and therefore bade him remain at
home."
His head whirled; the whole room seemed to be turning round.
"He
lay down on the sofa, and closed his eyes."
One way or the other the question was to be decided at last--finally.
"Oh, no, he did not think of Aglaya as a boarding-school miss, or a young
lady of the conventional type!"
"He had long since feared that she might
take some such step as this."
But why did she wish to see Nastasia?
He shivered all over as he lay; he was in high fever again.
No!
he did not account her a child.
"Certain of her looks, certain of her
words, of late, had filled him with apprehension."
"At times it had struck
him that she was putting too great a restraint upon herself, and he
remembered that he had been alarmed to observe this."
"He had tried, all
these days, to drive away the heavy thoughts that oppressed him;
but what was the hidden mystery of that soul?"
"The question had long
tormented him, although he implicitly trusted that soul."
"And now it was
all to be cleared up."
It was a dreadful thought.
And “that woman” again!
"Why did he always feel as though “that woman” were fated to appear at
each critical moment of his life, and tear the thread of his destiny
like a bit of rotten string?"
"That he always _had_ felt this he was ready
to swear, although he was half delirious at the moment."
"If he had tried
to forget her, all this time, it was simply because he was afraid of
her."
Did he love the woman or hate her?
"This question he did not once
ask himself today; his heart was quite pure."
He knew whom he loved.
"He
was not so much afraid of this meeting, nor of its strangeness, nor of
any reasons there might be for it, unknown to himself; he was afraid
of the woman herself, Nastasia Philipovna."
"He remembered, some days
afterwards, how during all those fevered hours he had seen but _her_ eyes,
_her_ look, had heard _her_ voice, strange words of hers; he remembered
that this was so, although he could not recollect the details of his
thoughts."
"He could remember that Vera brought him some dinner, and that he took
it; but whether he slept after dinner, or no, he could not recollect."
"He only knew that he began to distinguish things clearly from the moment
when Aglaya suddenly appeared, and he jumped up from the sofa and went
to meet her."
It was just a quarter past seven then.
"Aglaya was quite alone, and dressed, apparently hastily, in a light
mantle."
"Her face was pale, as it had been in the morning, and her
eyes were ablaze with bright but subdued fire."
"He had never seen that
expression in her eyes before."
She gazed attentively at him.
"“You are quite ready, I observe,” she said, with absolute composure,
“dressed, and your hat in your hand."
"I see somebody has thought fit to
warn you, and I know who."
"Hippolyte?”

“Yes, he told me,” said the prince, feeling only half alive."
“Come then.
"You know, I suppose, that you must escort me there?"
"You are
well enough to go out, aren’t you?”

“I am well enough; but is it really possible?--”

He broke off abruptly, and could not add another word."
"This was his one
attempt to stop the mad child, and, after he had made it, he followed
her as though he had no will of his own."
"Confused as his thoughts were,
he was, nevertheless, capable of realizing the fact that if he did
not go with her, she would go alone, and so he must go with her at all
hazards."
"He guessed the strength of her determination; it was beyond him
to check it."
"They walked silently, and said scarcely a word all the way."
"He only
noticed that she seemed to know the road very well; and once, when he
thought it better to go by a certain lane, and remarked to her that it
would be quieter and less public, she only said, “it’s all the same,”
 and went on."
"When they were almost arrived at Daria Alexeyevna’s house (it was a
large wooden structure of ancient date), a gorgeously-dressed lady and
a young girl came out of it."
"Both these ladies took their seats in a
carriage, which was waiting at the door, talking and laughing loudly
the while, and drove away without appearing to notice the approaching
couple."
"No sooner had the carriage driven off than the door opened once more;
and Rogojin, who had apparently been awaiting them, let them in and
closed it after them."
"“There is not another soul in the house now excepting our four selves,”
 he said aloud, looking at the prince in a strange way."
"Nastasia Philipovna was waiting for them in the first room they went
into."
"She was dressed very simply, in black."
"She rose at their entrance, but did not smile or give her hand, even to
the prince."
Her anxious eyes were fixed upon Aglaya.
"Both sat down, at
a little distance from one another--Aglaya on the sofa, in the corner
of the room, Nastasia by the window."
"The prince and Rogojin remained
standing, and were not invited to sit."
"Muishkin glanced at Rogojin in perplexity, but the latter only smiled
disagreeably, and said nothing."
"The silence continued for some few
moments."
"An ominous expression passed over Nastasia Philipovna’s face, of a
sudden."
"It became obstinate-looking, hard, and full of hatred; but she
did not take her eyes off her visitors for a moment."
"Aglaya was clearly confused, but not frightened."
"On entering she had
merely glanced momentarily at her rival, and then had sat still, with
her eyes on the ground, apparently in thought."
"Once or twice she
glanced casually round the room."
"A shade of disgust was visible in her
expression; she looked as though she were afraid of contamination in
this place."
"She mechanically arranged her dress, and fidgeted uncomfortably,
eventually changing her seat to the other end of the sofa."
"Probably
she was unconscious of her own movements; but this very unconsciousness
added to the offensiveness of their suggested meaning."
"At length she looked straight into Nastasia’s eyes, and instantly read
all there was to read in her rival’s expression."
Woman understood woman!
Aglaya shuddered.
"“You know of course why I requested this meeting?” she said at last,
quietly, and pausing twice in the delivery of this very short sentence."
"“No--I know nothing about it,” said Nastasia, drily and abruptly."
Aglaya blushed.
"Perhaps it struck her as very strange and impossible
that she should really be sitting here and waiting for “that woman’s”
 reply to her question."
At the first sound of Nastasia’s voice a shudder ran through her frame.
Of course “that woman” observed and took in all this.
"“You know quite well, but you are pretending to be ignorant,” said
Aglaya, very low, with her eyes on the ground."
"“Why should I?” asked Nastasia Philipovna, smiling slightly."
"“You want to take advantage of my position, now that I am in your
house,” continued Aglaya, awkwardly."
"“For that position _you_ are to blame and not I,” said Nastasia, flaring
up suddenly."
"“_I_ did not invite _you_, but you me; and to this moment I
am quite ignorant as to why I am thus honoured.”

Aglaya raised her head haughtily."
“Restrain your tongue!” she said.
"“I did not come here to fight you with
your own weapons."
“Oh!
"then you did come ‘to fight,’ I may conclude?"
"Dear me!--and I
thought you were cleverer--”

They looked at one another with undisguised malice."
"One of these women
had written to the other, so lately, such letters as we have seen; and
it all was dispersed at their first meeting."
"Yet it appeared that
not one of the four persons in the room considered this in any degree
strange."
"The prince who, up to yesterday, would not have believed that he could
even dream of such an impossible scene as this, stood and listened and
looked on, and felt as though he had long foreseen it all."
"The most
fantastic dream seemed suddenly to have been metamorphosed into the most
vivid reality."
"One of these women so despised the other, and so longed to express her
contempt for her (perhaps she had only come for that very purpose, as
Rogojin said next day), that howsoever fantastical was the other woman,
howsoever afflicted her spirit and disturbed her understanding, no
preconceived idea of hers could possibly stand up against that deadly
feminine contempt of her rival."
"The prince felt sure that Nastasia
would say nothing about the letters herself; but he could judge by her
flashing eyes and the expression of her face what the thought of those
letters must be costing her at this moment."
"He would have given half his
life to prevent Aglaya from speaking of them."
"But Aglaya suddenly braced
herself up, and seemed to master herself fully, all in an instant."
"“You have not quite understood,” she said."
"“I did not come to quarrel
with you, though I do not like you."
"I came to speak to you as... as one
human being to another."
"I came with my mind made up as to what I had
to say to you, and I shall not change my intention, although you may
misunderstand me."
"So much the worse for you, not for myself!"
"I wished to
reply to all you have written to me and to reply personally, because I
think that is the more convenient way."
"Listen to my reply to all your
letters."
"I began to be sorry for Prince Lef Nicolaievitch on the very
day I made his acquaintance, and when I heard--afterwards--of all that
took place at your house in the evening, I was sorry for him because he
was such a simple-minded man, and because he, in the simplicity of his
soul, believed that he could be happy with a woman of your character."
"What I feared actually took place; you could not love him, you tortured
him, and threw him over."
"You could not love him because you are too
proud--no, not proud, that is an error; because you are too vain--no,
not quite that either; too self-loving; you are self-loving to madness."
Your letters to me are a proof of it.
"You could not love so simple a
soul as his, and perhaps in your heart you despised him and laughed at
him."
"All you could love was your shame and the perpetual thought that
you were disgraced and insulted."
"If you were less shameful, or had no
cause at all for shame, you would be still more unhappy than you are
now.”

Aglaya brought out these thronging words with great satisfaction."
"They
came from her lips hurriedly and impetuously, and had been prepared and
thought out long ago, even before she had ever dreamed of the present
meeting."
"She watched with eagerness the effect of her speech as shown in
Nastasia’s face, which was distorted with agitation."
"“You remember,” she continued, “he wrote me a letter at that time;
he says you know all about that letter and that you even read it."
"I
understand all by means of this letter, and understand it correctly."
"He
has since confirmed it all to me--what I now say to you, word for word."
"After receiving his letter I waited; I guessed that you would soon come
back here, because you could never do without Petersburg; you are still
too young and lovely for the provinces."
"However, this is not my own
idea,” she added, blushing dreadfully; and from this moment the colour
never left her cheeks to the end of her speech."
"“When I next saw the
prince I began to feel terribly pained and hurt on his account."
"Do not
laugh; if you laugh you are unworthy of understanding what I say.”

“Surely you see that I am not laughing,” said Nastasia, sadly and
sternly."
"“However, it’s all the same to me; laugh or not, just as you please."
"When I asked him about you, he told me that he had long since ceased to
love you, that the very recollection of you was a torture to him, but
that he was sorry for you; and that when he thought of you his heart was
pierced."
"I ought to tell you that I never in my life met a man anything
like him for noble simplicity of mind and for boundless trustfulness."
"I guessed that anyone who liked could deceive him, and that he would
immediately forgive anyone who did deceive him; and it was for this that
I grew to love him--”

Aglaya paused for a moment, as though suddenly brought up in
astonishment that she could have said these words, but at the same time
a great pride shone in her eyes, like a defiant assertion that it would
not matter to her if “this woman” laughed in her face for the admission
just made."
"“I have told you all now, and of course you understand what I wish of
you.”

“Perhaps I do; but tell me yourself,” said Nastasia Philipovna, quietly."
Aglaya flushed up angrily.
"“I wished to find out from you,” she said, firmly, “by what right you
dare to meddle with his feelings for me?"
"By what right you dared send me
those letters?"
"By what right do you continually remind both me and him
that you love him, after you yourself threw him over and ran away from
him in so insulting and shameful a way?”

“I never told either him or you that I loved him!” replied Nastasia
Philipovna, with an effort."
"“And--and I did run away from him--you are
right there,” she added, scarcely audibly."
“Never told either him or me?” cried Aglaya.
“How about your letters?
Who asked you to try to persuade me to marry him?
"Was not that a
declaration from you?"
Why do you force yourself upon us in this way?
"I
confess I thought at first that you were anxious to arouse an aversion
for him in my heart by your meddling, in order that I might give him up;
and it was only afterwards that I guessed the truth."
"You imagined that
you were doing an heroic action!"
"How could you spare any love for him,
when you love your own vanity to such an extent?"
"Why could you not
simply go away from here, instead of writing me those absurd letters?"
"Why do you not _now_ marry that generous man who loves you, and has done
you the honour of offering you his hand?"
"It is plain enough why; if you
marry Rogojin you lose your grievance; you will have nothing more to
complain of."
You will be receiving too much honour.
"Evgenie Pavlovitch
was saying the other day that you had read too many poems and are too
well educated for--your position; and that you live in idleness."
"Add to
this your vanity, and, there you have reason enough--”

“And do you not live in idleness?”

Things had come to this unexpected point too quickly."
"Unexpected because
Nastasia Philipovna, on her way to Pavlofsk, had thought and considered
a good deal, and had expected something different, though perhaps not
altogether good, from this interview; but Aglaya had been carried away
by her own outburst, just as a rolling stone gathers impetus as it
careers downhill, and could not restrain herself in the satisfaction of
revenge."
"It was strange, Nastasia Philipovna felt, to see Aglaya like this."
"She
gazed at her, and could hardly believe her eyes and ears for a moment or
two."
"Whether she were a woman who had read too many poems, as Evgenie
Pavlovitch supposed, or whether she were mad, as the prince had
assured Aglaya, at all events, this was a woman who, in spite of her
occasionally cynical and audacious manner, was far more refined and
trustful and sensitive than appeared."
"There was a certain amount of
romantic dreaminess and caprice in her, but with the fantastic was
mingled much that was strong and deep."
"The prince realized this, and great suffering expressed itself in his
face."
"Aglaya observed it, and trembled with anger."
"“How dare you speak so to me?” she said, with a haughtiness which was
quite indescribable, replying to Nastasia’s last remark."
"“You must have misunderstood what I said,” said Nastasia, in some
surprise."
"“If you wished to preserve your good name, why did you not give up
your--your ‘guardian,’ Totski, without all that theatrical posturing?”
 said Aglaya, suddenly a propos of nothing."
"“What do you know of my position, that you dare to judge me?” cried
Nastasia, quivering with rage, and growing terribly white."
"“I know this much, that you did not go out to honest work, but went away
with a rich man, Rogojin, in order to pose as a fallen angel."
"I don’t
wonder that Totski was nearly driven to suicide by such a fallen angel.”

“Silence!” cried Nastasia Philipovna."
"“You are about as fit to
understand me as the housemaid here, who bore witness against her lover
in court the other day."
"She would understand me better than you do.”

“Probably an honest girl living by her own toil."
"Why do you speak of a
housemaid so contemptuously?”

“I do not despise toil; I despise you when you speak of toil.”

“If you had cared to be an honest woman, you would have gone out as a
laundress.”

Both had risen, and were gazing at one another with pallid faces."
"“Aglaya, don’t!"
"This is unfair,” cried the prince, deeply distressed."
"Rogojin was not smiling now; he sat and listened with folded arms, and
lips tight compressed."
"“There, look at her,” cried Nastasia, trembling with passion."
"“Look at
this young lady!"
And I imagined her an angel!
"Did you come to me without
your governess, Aglaya Ivanovna?"
"Oh, fie, now shall I just tell you why
you came here today?"
Shall I tell you without any embellishments?
"You
came because you were afraid of me!”

“Afraid of _you?_” asked Aglaya, beside herself with naive amazement that
the other should dare talk to her like this."
"“Yes, me, of course!"
"Of course you were afraid of me, or you would not
have decided to come."
You cannot despise one you fear.
"And to think that
I have actually esteemed you up to this very moment!"
"Do you know why
you are afraid of me, and what is your object now?"
"You wished to satisfy
yourself with your own eyes as to which he loves best, myself or you,
because you are fearfully jealous.”

“He has told me already that he hates you,” murmured Aglaya, scarcely
audibly."
"“Perhaps, perhaps!"
"I am not worthy of him, I know."
"But I think you are
lying, all the same."
"He cannot hate me, and he cannot have said so."
"I am
ready to forgive you, in consideration of your position; but I confess
I thought better of you."
"I thought you were wiser, and more beautiful,
too; I did, indeed!"
"Well, take your treasure!"
"See, he is gazing at you,
he can’t recollect himself."
"Take him, but on one condition; go away at
once, this instant!”

She fell back into a chair, and burst into tears."
"But suddenly some new
expression blazed in her eyes."
"She stared fixedly at Aglaya, and rose
from her seat."
"“Or would you like me to bid him, _bid him_, do you hear, _command him_,
now, at once, to throw you up, and remain mine for ever?"
Shall I?
"He
will stay, and he will marry me too, and you shall trot home all alone."
"Shall I?--shall I say the word?” she screamed like a madwoman, scarcely
believing herself that she could really pronounce such wild words."
"Aglaya had made for the door in terror, but she stopped at the
threshold, and listened."
“Shall I turn Rogojin off?
Ha!
ha!
"you thought
I would marry him for your benefit, did you?"
"Why, I’ll call out _now_, if
you like, in your presence, ‘Rogojin, get out!’ and say to the prince,
‘Do you remember what you promised me?’ Heavens!"
"what a fool I have been
to humiliate myself before them!"
"Why, prince, you yourself gave me your
word that you would marry me whatever happened, and would never abandon
me."
"You said you loved me and would forgive me all, and--and resp--yes,
you even said that!"
"I only ran away from you in order to set you free,
and now I don’t care to let you go again."
"Why does she treat me so--so
shamefully?"
I am not a loose woman--ask Rogojin there!
He’ll tell you.
"Will you go again now that she has insulted me, before your eyes, too;
turn away from me and lead her away, arm-in-arm?"
"May you be accursed
too, for you were the only one I trusted among them all!"
"Go away,
Rogojin, I don’t want you,” she continued, blind with fury, and forcing
the words out with dry lips and distorted features, evidently not
believing a single word of her own tirade, but, at the same time, doing
her utmost to prolong the moment of self-deception."
"The outburst was so terribly violent that the prince thought it would
have killed her."
"“There he is!” she shrieked again, pointing to the prince and addressing
Aglaya."
“There he is!
"and if he does not approach me at once and take
_me_ and throw you over, then have him for your own--I give him up to
you!"
"I don’t want him!”

Both she and Aglaya stood and waited as though in expectation, and both
looked at the prince like madwomen."
"But he, perhaps, did not understand the full force of this challenge; in
fact, it is certain he did not."
"All he could see was the poor despairing
face which, as he had said to Aglaya, “had pierced his heart for ever.”

He could bear it no longer, and with a look of entreaty, mingled with
reproach, he addressed Aglaya, pointing to Nastasia the while:

“How can you?” he murmured; “she is so unhappy.”

But he had no time to say another word before Aglaya’s terrible look
bereft him of speech."
"In that look was embodied so dreadful a suffering
and so deadly a hatred, that he gave a cry and flew to her; but it was
too late."
"She could not hold out long enough even to witness his movement in her
direction."
"She had hidden her face in her hands, cried once “Oh, my
God!” and rushed out of the room."
"Rogojin followed her to undo the bolts
of the door and let her out into the street."
"The prince made a rush after her, but he was caught and held back."
"The
distorted, livid face of Nastasia gazed at him reproachfully, and her
blue lips whispered:

“What?"
"Would you go to her--to her?”

She fell senseless into his arms."
"He raised her, carried her into the room, placed her in an arm-chair,
and stood over her, stupefied."
On the table stood a tumbler of water.
"Rogojin, who now returned, took this and sprinkled a little in her face."
"She opened her eyes, but for a moment she understood nothing."
"Suddenly she looked around, shuddered, gave a loud cry, and threw
herself in the prince’s arms."
"“Mine, mine!” she cried."
“Has the proud young lady gone?
"Ha, ha, ha!”
 she laughed hysterically."
“And I had given him up to her!
"Why--why did
I?"
Mad--mad!
"Get away, Rogojin!"
"Ha, ha, ha!”

Rogojin stared intently at them; then he took his hat, and without a
word, left the room."
"A few moments later, the prince was seated by Nastasia on the sofa,
gazing into her eyes and stroking her face and hair, as he would a
little child’s."
"He laughed when she laughed, and was ready to cry when
she cried."
"He did not speak, but listened to her excited, disconnected
chatter, hardly understanding a word of it the while."
"No sooner did
he detect the slightest appearance of complaining, or weeping, or
reproaching, than he would smile at her kindly, and begin stroking her
hair and her cheeks, soothing and consoling her once more, as if she
were a child."
IX.
"A fortnight had passed since the events recorded in the last chapter,
and the position of the actors in our story had become so changed that
it is almost impossible for us to continue the tale without some few
explanations."
"Yet we feel that we ought to limit ourselves to the simple
record of facts, without much attempt at explanation, for a very patent
reason: because we ourselves have the greatest possible difficulty in
accounting for the facts to be recorded."
"Such a statement on our part
may appear strange to the reader."
"How is anyone to tell a story which he
cannot understand himself?"
"In order to keep clear of a false position,
we had perhaps better give an example of what we mean; and probably the
intelligent reader will soon understand the difficulty."
"More especially
are we inclined to take this course since the example will constitute a
distinct march forward of our story, and will not hinder the progress of
the events remaining to be recorded."
"During the next fortnight--that is, through the early part of July--the
history of our hero was circulated in the form of strange, diverting,
most unlikely-sounding stories, which passed from mouth to mouth,
through the streets and villas adjoining those inhabited by Lebedeff,
Ptitsin, Nastasia Philipovna and the Epanchins; in fact, pretty
well through the whole town and its environs."
"All society--both the
inhabitants of the place and those who came down of an evening for the
music--had got hold of one and the same story, in a thousand varieties
of detail--as to how a certain young prince had raised a terrible
scandal in a most respectable household, had thrown over a daughter of
the family, to whom he was engaged, and had been captured by a woman of
shady reputation whom he was determined to marry at once--breaking off
all old ties for the satisfaction of his insane idea; and, in spite of
the public indignation roused by his action, the marriage was to take
place in Pavlofsk openly and publicly, and the prince had announced his
intention of going through with it with head erect and looking the whole
world in the face."
"The story was so artfully adorned with scandalous
details, and persons of so great eminence and importance were
apparently mixed up in it, while, at the same time, the evidence was so
circumstantial, that it was no wonder the matter gave food for plenty of
curiosity and gossip."
"According to the reports of the most talented gossip-mongers--those who,
in every class of society, are always in haste to explain every event
to their neighbours--the young gentleman concerned was of good family--a
prince--fairly rich--weak of intellect, but a democrat and a dabbler
in the Nihilism of the period, as exposed by Mr. Turgenieff."
"He could
hardly talk Russian, but had fallen in love with one of the Miss
Epanchins, and his suit met with so much encouragement that he had been
received in the house as the recognized bridegroom-to-be of the young
lady."
"But like the Frenchman of whom the story is told that he studied
for holy orders, took all the oaths, was ordained priest, and next
morning wrote to his bishop informing him that, as he did not believe
in God and considered it wrong to deceive the people and live upon their
pockets, he begged to surrender the orders conferred upon him the day
before, and to inform his lordship that he was sending this letter to
the public press,--like this Frenchman, the prince played a false game."
"It was rumoured that he had purposely waited for the solemn occasion of
a large evening party at the house of his future bride, at which he was
introduced to several eminent persons, in order publicly to make known
his ideas and opinions, and thereby insult the “big-wigs,” and to throw
over his bride as offensively as possible; and that, resisting the
servants who were told off to turn him out of the house, he had seized
and thrown down a magnificent china vase."
"As a characteristic addition
to the above, it was currently reported that the young prince really
loved the lady to whom he was engaged, and had thrown her over out of
purely Nihilistic motives, with the intention of giving himself the
satisfaction of marrying a fallen woman in the face of all the world,
thereby publishing his opinion that there is no distinction between
virtuous and disreputable women, but that all women are alike, free; and
a “fallen” woman, indeed, somewhat superior to a virtuous one."
"It was declared that he believed in no classes or anything else,
excepting “the woman question.”

All this looked likely enough, and was accepted as fact by most of the
inhabitants of the place, especially as it was borne out, more or less,
by daily occurrences."
Of course much was said that could not be determined absolutely.
"For
instance, it was reported that the poor girl had so loved her future
husband that she had followed him to the house of the other woman, the
day after she had been thrown over; others said that he had insisted on
her coming, himself, in order to shame and insult her by his taunts and
Nihilistic confessions when she reached the house."
"However all
these things might be, the public interest in the matter grew
daily, especially as it became clear that the scandalous wedding was
undoubtedly to take place."
"So that if our readers were to ask an explanation, not of the wild
reports about the prince’s Nihilistic opinions, but simply as to how
such a marriage could possibly satisfy his real aspirations, or as to
the spiritual condition of our hero at this time, we confess that we
should have great difficulty in giving the required information."
"All we know is, that the marriage really was arranged, and that the
prince had commissioned Lebedeff and Keller to look after all the
necessary business connected with it; that he had requested them to
spare no expense; that Nastasia herself was hurrying on the wedding;
that Keller was to be the prince’s best man, at his own earnest request;
and that Burdovsky was to give Nastasia away, to his great delight."
"The
wedding was to take place before the middle of July."
"But, besides the above, we are cognizant of certain other undoubted
facts, which puzzle us a good deal because they seem flatly to
contradict the foregoing."
"We suspect, for instance, that having commissioned Lebedeff and the
others, as above, the prince immediately forgot all about masters of
ceremonies and even the ceremony itself; and we feel quite certain that
in making these arrangements he did so in order that he might absolutely
escape all thought of the wedding, and even forget its approach if he
could, by detailing all business concerning it to others."
"What did he think of all this time, then?"
What did he wish for?
"There is
no doubt that he was a perfectly free agent all through, and that as
far as Nastasia was concerned, there was no force of any kind brought
to bear on him."
"Nastasia wished for a speedy marriage, true!--but the
prince agreed at once to her proposals; he agreed, in fact, so casually
that anyone might suppose he was but acceding to the most simple and
ordinary suggestion."
"There are many strange circumstances such as this before us; but in
our opinion they do but deepen the mystery, and do not in the smallest
degree help us to understand the case."
"However, let us take one more example."
"Thus, we know for a fact that
during the whole of this fortnight the prince spent all his days and
evenings with Nastasia; he walked with her, drove with her; he began to
be restless whenever he passed an hour without seeing her--in fact,
to all appearances, he sincerely loved her."
"He would listen to her for
hours at a time with a quiet smile on his face, scarcely saying a word
himself."
"And yet we know, equally certainly, that during this period he
several times set off, suddenly, to the Epanchins’, not concealing
the fact from Nastasia Philipovna, and driving the latter to absolute
despair."
"We know also that he was not received at the Epanchins’ so long
as they remained at Pavlofsk, and that he was not allowed an interview
with Aglaya;--but next day he would set off once more on the same
errand, apparently quite oblivious of the fact of yesterday’s visit
having been a failure,--and, of course, meeting with another refusal."
"We know, too, that exactly an hour after Aglaya had fled from Nastasia
Philipovna’s house on that fateful evening, the prince was at the
Epanchins’,--and that his appearance there had been the cause of the
greatest consternation and dismay; for Aglaya had not been home, and the
family only discovered then, for the first time, that the two of them
had been to Nastasia’s house together."
"It was said that Elizabetha Prokofievna and her daughters had there and
then denounced the prince in the strongest terms, and had refused
any further acquaintance and friendship with him; their rage and
denunciations being redoubled when Varia Ardalionovna suddenly arrived
and stated that Aglaya had been at her house in a terrible state of mind
for the last hour, and that she refused to come home."
"This last item of news, which disturbed Lizabetha Prokofievna more than
anything else, was perfectly true."
"On leaving Nastasia’s, Aglaya had
felt that she would rather die than face her people, and had therefore
gone straight to Nina Alexandrovna’s."
"On receiving the news, Lizabetha
and her daughters and the general all rushed off to Aglaya, followed
by Prince Lef Nicolaievitch--undeterred by his recent dismissal; but
through Varia he was refused a sight of Aglaya here also."
"The end of the
episode was that when Aglaya saw her mother and sisters crying over her
and not uttering a word of reproach, she had flung herself into their
arms and gone straight home with them."
"It was said that Gania managed to make a fool of himself even on this
occasion; for, finding himself alone with Aglaya for a minute or two
when Varia had gone to the Epanchins’, he had thought it a fitting
opportunity to make a declaration of his love, and on hearing this
Aglaya, in spite of her state of mind at the time, had suddenly burst
out laughing, and had put a strange question to him."
"She asked him
whether he would consent to hold his finger to a lighted candle in proof
of his devotion!"
"Gania--it was said--looked so comically bewildered that
Aglaya had almost laughed herself into hysterics, and had rushed out of
the room and upstairs,--where her parents had found her."
"Hippolyte told the prince this last story, sending for him on purpose."
"When Muishkin heard about the candle and Gania’s finger he had laughed
so that he had quite astonished Hippolyte,--and then shuddered and burst
into tears."
"The prince’s condition during those days was strange and
perturbed."
"Hippolyte plainly declared that he thought he was out of his
mind;--this, however, was hardly to be relied upon."
"Offering all these facts to our readers and refusing to explain them,
we do not for a moment desire to justify our hero’s conduct."
"On the
contrary, we are quite prepared to feel our share of the indignation
which his behaviour aroused in the hearts of his friends."
"Even Vera
Lebedeff was angry with him for a while; so was Colia; so was Keller,
until he was selected for best man; so was Lebedeff himself,--who began
to intrigue against him out of pure irritation;--but of this anon."
"In
fact we are in full accord with certain forcible words spoken to the
prince by Evgenie Pavlovitch, quite unceremoniously, during the course
of a friendly conversation, six or seven days after the events at
Nastasia Philipovna’s house."
"We may remark here that not only the Epanchins themselves, but all who
had anything to do with them, thought it right to break with the prince
in consequence of his conduct."
"Prince S. even went so far as to turn
away and cut him dead in the street."
"But Evgenie Pavlovitch was not
afraid to compromise himself by paying the prince a visit, and did so,
in spite of the fact that he had recommenced to visit at the Epanchins’,
where he was received with redoubled hospitality and kindness after the
temporary estrangement."
"Evgenie called upon the prince the day after that on which the Epanchins
left Pavlofsk."
"He knew of all the current rumours,--in fact, he had
probably contributed to them himself."
"The prince was delighted to see
him, and immediately began to speak of the Epanchins;--which simple and
straightforward opening quite took Evgenie’s fancy, so that he melted at
once, and plunged in medias res without ceremony."
"The prince did not know, up to this, that the Epanchins had left the
place."
"He grew very pale on hearing the news; but a moment later he
nodded his head, and said thoughtfully:

“I knew it was bound to be so.” Then he added quickly:

“Where have they gone to?”

Evgenie meanwhile observed him attentively, and the rapidity of the
questions, their simplicity, the prince’s candour, and at the same
time, his evident perplexity and mental agitation, surprised him
considerably."
"However, he told Muishkin all he could, kindly and
in detail."
"The prince hardly knew anything, for this was the first
informant from the household whom he had met since the estrangement."
"Evgenie reported that Aglaya had been really ill, and that for two
nights she had not slept at all, owing to high fever; that now she was
better and out of serious danger, but still in a nervous, hysterical
state."
"“It’s a good thing that there is peace in the house, at all events,” he
continued."
"“They never utter a hint about the past, not only in Aglaya’s
presence, but even among themselves."
"The old people are talking of a
trip abroad in the autumn, immediately after Adelaida’s wedding; Aglaya
received the news in silence.”

Evgenie himself was very likely going abroad also; so were Prince S.
and his wife, if affairs allowed of it; the general was to stay at home."
"They were all at their estate of Colmina now, about twenty miles or so
from St. Petersburg."
"Princess Bielokonski had not returned to Moscow
yet, and was apparently staying on for reasons of her own."
"Lizabetha
Prokofievna had insisted that it was quite impossible to remain in
Pavlofsk after what had happened."
"Evgenie had told her of all the
rumours current in town about the affair; so that there could be no talk
of their going to their house on the Yelagin as yet."
"“And in point of fact, prince,” added Evgenie Pavlovitch, “you must
allow that they could hardly have stayed here, considering that they
knew of all that went on at your place, and in the face of your daily
visits to their house, visits which you insisted upon making in spite of
their refusal to see you.”

“Yes--yes, quite so; you are quite right."
"I wished to see Aglaya
Ivanovna, you know!” said the prince, nodding his head."
"“Oh, my dear fellow,” cried Evgenie, warmly, with real sorrow in his
voice, “how could you permit all that to come about as it has?"
"Of
course, of course, I know it was all so unexpected."
"I admit that you,
only naturally, lost your head, and--and could not stop the foolish
girl; that was not in your power."
"I quite see so much; but you really
should have understood how seriously she cared for you."
"She could not
bear to share you with another; and you could bring yourself to throw
away and shatter such a treasure!"
"Oh, prince, prince!”

“Yes, yes, you are quite right again,” said the poor prince, in anguish
of mind."
"“I was wrong, I know."
"But it was only Aglaya who looked on
Nastasia Philipovna so; no one else did, you know.”

“But that’s just the worst of it all, don’t you see, that there was
absolutely nothing serious about the matter in reality!” cried Evgenie,
beside himself: “Excuse me, prince, but I have thought over all this; I
have thought a great deal over it; I know all that had happened before;
I know all that took place six months since; and I know there was
_nothing_ serious about the matter, it was but fancy, smoke, fantasy,
distorted by agitation, and only the alarmed jealousy of an absolutely
inexperienced girl could possibly have mistaken it for serious reality.”

Here Evgenie Pavlovitch quite let himself go, and gave the reins to his
indignation."
"Clearly and reasonably, and with great psychological insight, he drew a
picture of the prince’s past relations with Nastasia Philipovna."
"Evgenie Pavlovitch always had a ready tongue, but on this occasion his
eloquence, surprised himself."
"“From the very beginning,” he said, “you
began with a lie; what began with a lie was bound to end with a lie;
such is the law of nature."
"I do not agree, in fact I am angry, when I
hear you called an idiot; you are far too intelligent to deserve such
an epithet; but you are so far _strange_ as to be unlike others; that you
must allow, yourself."
"Now, I have come to the conclusion that the basis
of all that has happened, has been first of all your innate inexperience
(remark the expression ‘innate,’ prince)."
"Then follows your unheard-of
simplicity of heart; then comes your absolute want of sense of
proportion (to this want you have several times confessed); and lastly,
a mass, an accumulation, of intellectual convictions which you, in your
unexampled honesty of soul, accept unquestionably as also innate and
natural and true."
"Admit, prince, that in your relations with Nastasia
Philipovna there has existed, from the very first, something democratic,
and the fascination, so to speak, of the ‘woman question’?"
"I know all
about that scandalous scene at Nastasia Philipovna’s house when Rogojin
brought the money, six months ago."
"I’ll show you yourself as in a
looking-glass, if you like."
"I know exactly all that went on, in every
detail, and why things have turned out as they have."
"You thirsted, while
in Switzerland, for your home-country, for Russia; you read, doubtless,
many books about Russia, excellent books, I dare say, but hurtful to
_you_; and you arrived here; as it were, on fire with the longing to be
of service."
"Then, on the very day of your arrival, they tell you a sad
story of an ill-used woman; they tell _you_, a knight, pure and without
reproach, this tale of a poor woman!"
"The same day you actually _see_
her; you are attracted by her beauty, her fantastic, almost demoniacal,
beauty--(I admit her beauty, of course)."
"“Add to all this your nervous nature, your epilepsy, and your sudden
arrival in a strange town--the day of meetings and of exciting scenes,
the day of unexpected acquaintanceships, the day of sudden actions,
the day of meeting with the three lovely Epanchin girls, and among
them Aglaya--add your fatigue, your excitement; add Nastasia’ s evening
party, and the tone of that party, and--what were you to expect of
yourself at such a moment as that?”

“Yes, yes, yes!” said the prince, once more, nodding his head, and
blushing slightly."
"“Yes, it was so, or nearly so--I know it."
"And
besides, you see, I had not slept the night before, in the train, or the
night before that, either, and I was very tired.”

“Of course, of course, quite so; that’s what I am driving at!”
 continued Evgenie, excitedly."
"“It is as clear as possible, and most
comprehensible, that you, in your enthusiasm, should plunge headlong
into the first chance that came of publicly airing your great idea that
you, a prince, and a pure-living man, did not consider a woman disgraced
if the sin were not her own, but that of a disgusting social libertine!"
"Oh, heavens!"
"it’s comprehensible enough, my dear prince, but that is not
the question, unfortunately!"
"The question is, was there any reality
and truth in your feelings?"
"Was it nature, or nothing but intellectual
enthusiasm?"
What do you think yourself?
"We are told, of course, that a
far worse woman was _forgiven_, but we don’t find that she was told that
she had done well, or that she was worthy of honour and respect!"
"Did not
your common-sense show you what was the real state of the case, a few
months later?"
"The question is now, not whether she is an innocent woman
(I do not insist one way or the other--I do not wish to); but can her
whole career justify such intolerable pride, such insolent, rapacious
egotism as she has shown?"
"Forgive me, I am too violent, perhaps, but--”

“Yes--I dare say it is all as you say; I dare say you are quite right,”
 muttered the prince once more."
"“She is very sensitive and easily put
out, of course; but still, she...”

“She is worthy of sympathy?"
"Is that what you wished to say, my good
fellow?"
"But then, for the mere sake of vindicating her worthiness of
sympathy, you should not have insulted and offended a noble and generous
girl in her presence!"
This is a terrible exaggeration of sympathy!
"How
can you love a girl, and yet so humiliate her as to throw her over for
the sake of another woman, before the very eyes of that other woman,
when you have already made her a formal proposal of marriage?"
"And you
_did_ propose to her, you know; you did so before her parents and sisters."
"Can you be an honest man, prince, if you act so?"
I ask you!
"And did you
not deceive that beautiful girl when you assured her of your love?”

“Yes, you are quite right."
Oh!
"I feel that I am very guilty!” said
Muishkin, in deepest distress."
"“But as if that is enough!” cried Evgenie, indignantly."
"“As if it is
enough simply to say: ‘I know I am very guilty!’ You are to blame, and
yet you persevere in evil-doing."
"Where was your heart, I should like to
know, your _christian heart_, all that time?"
"Did she look as though she
were suffering less, at that moment?"
"You saw her face--was she suffering
less than the other woman?"
"How could you see her suffering and allow it
to continue?"
"How could you?”

“But I did not allow it,” murmured the wretched prince."
"“How--what do you mean you didn’t allow?”

“Upon my word, I didn’t!"
"To this moment I don’t know how it all
happened."
"I--I ran after Aglaya Ivanovna, but Nastasia Philipovna fell
down in a faint; and since that day they won’t let me see Aglaya--that’s
all I know.”

“It’s all the same; you ought to have run after Aglaya though the other
was fainting.”

“Yes, yes, I ought--but I couldn’t!"
"She would have died--she would
have killed herself."
"You don’t know her; and I should have told Aglaya
everything afterwards--but I see, Evgenie Pavlovitch, you don’t know
all."
"Tell me now, why am I not allowed to see Aglaya?"
"I should have
cleared it all up, you know."
"Neither of them kept to the real point, you
see."
"I could never explain what I mean to you, but I think I could to
Aglaya."
Oh!
"my God, my God!"
"You spoke just now of Aglaya’s face at the
moment when she ran away."
"Oh, my God!"
I remember it!
"Come along,
come along--quick!” He pulled at Evgenie’s coat-sleeve nervously and
excitedly, and rose from his chair."
"“Where to?”

“Come to Aglaya--quick, quick!”

“But I told you she is not at Pavlofsk."
"And what would be the use if she
were?”

“Oh, she’ll understand, she’ll understand!” cried the prince, clasping
his hands."
"“She would understand that all this is not the point--not a
bit the real point--it is quite foreign to the real question.”

“How can it be foreign?"
"You _are_ going to be married, are you not?"
"Very
well, then you are persisting in your course."
"_Are_ you going to marry her
or not?”

“Yes, I shall marry her--yes.”

“Then why is it ‘not the point’?”

“Oh, no, it is not the point, not a bit."
"It makes no difference, my
marrying her--it means nothing.”

“How ‘means nothing’?"
"You are talking nonsense, my friend."
"You are
marrying the woman you love in order to secure her happiness, and Aglaya
sees and knows it."
"How can you say that it’s ‘not the point’?”

“Her happiness?"
"Oh, no!"
"I am only marrying her--well, because she wished
it."
It means nothing--it’s all the same.
"She would certainly have
died."
I see now that that marriage with Rogojin was an insane idea.
"I
understand all now that I did not understand before; and, do you know,
when those two stood opposite to one another, I could not bear Nastasia
Philipovna’s face!"
"You must know, Evgenie Pavlovitch, I have never told
anyone before--not even Aglaya--that I cannot bear Nastasia Philipovna’s
face.” (He lowered his voice mysteriously as he said this.)"
"“You
described that evening at Nastasia Philipovna’s (six months since) very
accurately just now; but there is one thing which you did not mention,
and of which you took no account, because you do not know."
"I mean her
_face_--I looked at her face, you see."
"Even in the morning when I saw her
portrait, I felt that I could not _bear_ to look at it."
"Now, there’s Vera
Lebedeff, for instance, her eyes are quite different, you know."
"I’m
_afraid_ of her face!” he added, with real alarm."
"“You are _afraid_ of it?”

“Yes--she’s mad!” he whispered, growing pale."
"“Do you know this for certain?” asked Evgenie, with the greatest
curiosity."
"“Yes, for certain--quite for certain, now!"
"I have discovered it
_absolutely_ for certain, these last few days.”

“What are you doing, then?” cried Evgenie, in horror."
"“You must be
marrying her solely out of _fear_, then!"
"I can’t make head or tail of it,
prince."
"Perhaps you don’t even love her?”

“Oh, no; I love her with all my soul."
"Why, she is a child!"
"She’s a child
now--a real child."
Oh!
"you know nothing about it at all, I see.”

“And are you assured, at the same time, that you love Aglaya too?”

“Yes--yes--oh; yes!”

“How so?"
"Do you want to make out that you love them _both?_”

“Yes--yes--both!"
"I do!”

“Excuse me, prince, but think what you are saying!"
"Recollect yourself!”

“Without Aglaya--I--I _must_ see Aglaya!--I shall die in my sleep very
soon--I thought I was dying in my sleep last night."
Oh!
"if Aglaya only
knew all--I mean really, _really_ all!"
"Because she must know _all_--that’s
the first condition towards understanding."
"Why cannot we ever know all
about another, especially when that other has been guilty?"
"But I
don’t know what I’m talking about--I’m so confused."
"You pained me so
dreadfully."
"Surely--surely Aglaya has not the same expression now as
she had at the moment when she ran away?"
"Oh, yes!"
"I am guilty and I
know it--I know it!"
"Probably I am in fault all round--I don’t quite know
how--but I am in fault, no doubt."
"There is something else, but I cannot
explain it to you, Evgenie Pavlovitch."
"I have no words; but Aglaya will
understand."
"I have always believed Aglaya will understand--I am assured
she will.”

“No, prince, she will not."
"Aglaya loved like a woman, like a human
being, not like an abstract spirit."
"Do you know what, my poor prince?"
"The most probable explanation of the matter is that you never loved
either the one or the other in reality.”

“I don’t know--perhaps you are right in much that you have said, Evgenie
Pavlovitch."
"You are very wise, Evgenie Pavlovitch--oh!"
"how my head is
beginning to ache again!"
"Come to her, quick--for God’s sake, come!”

“But I tell you she is not in Pavlofsk!"
"She’s in Colmina.”

“Oh, come to Colmina, then!"
"Come--let us go at once!”

“No--no, impossible!” said Evgenie, rising."
"“Look here--I’ll write a letter--take a letter for me!”

“No--no, prince; you must forgive me, but I can’t undertake any such
commissions!"
"I really can’t.”

And so they parted."
Evgenie Pavlovitch left the house with strange convictions.
"He, too,
felt that the prince must be out of his mind."
"“And what did he mean by that _face_--a face which he so fears, and yet
so loves?"
"And meanwhile he really may die, as he says, without seeing
Aglaya, and she will never know how devotedly he loves her!"
"Ha, ha, ha!"
How does the fellow manage to love two of them?
"Two different kinds of
love, I suppose!"
This is very interesting--poor idiot!
"What on earth
will become of him now?”

X."
"The prince did not die before his wedding--either by day or night, as
he had foretold that he might."
"Very probably he passed disturbed nights,
and was afflicted with bad dreams; but, during the daytime, among his
fellow-men, he seemed as kind as ever, and even contented; only a little
thoughtful when alone."
The wedding was hurried on.
"The day was fixed for exactly a week after
Evgenie’s visit to the prince."
"In the face of such haste as this,
even the prince’s best friends (if he had had any) would have felt the
hopelessness of any attempt to save “the poor madman.” Rumour said that
in the visit of Evgenie Pavlovitch was to be discerned the influence of
Lizabetha Prokofievna and her husband..."
"But if those good souls, in
the boundless kindness of their hearts, were desirous of saving the
eccentric young fellow from ruin, they were unable to take any stronger
measures to attain that end."
"Neither their position, nor their private
inclination, perhaps (and only naturally), would allow them to use any
more pronounced means."
"We have observed before that even some of the prince’s nearest
neighbours had begun to oppose him."
"Vera Lebedeff’s passive disagreement
was limited to the shedding of a few solitary tears; to more frequent
sitting alone at home, and to a diminished frequency in her visits to
the prince’s apartments."
Colia was occupied with his father at this time.
"The old man died during
a second stroke, which took place just eight days after the first."
"The
prince showed great sympathy in the grief of the family, and during the
first days of their mourning he was at the house a great deal with Nina
Alexandrovna."
"He went to the funeral, and it was observable that the
public assembled in church greeted his arrival and departure with
whisperings, and watched him closely."
"The same thing happened in the park and in the street, wherever he went."
"He was pointed out when he drove by, and he often overheard the name of
Nastasia Philipovna coupled with his own as he passed."
"People looked
out for her at the funeral, too, but she was not there; and another
conspicuous absentee was the captain’s widow, whom Lebedeff had
prevented from coming."
The funeral service produced a great effect on the prince.
"He whispered
to Lebedeff that this was the first time he had ever heard a Russian
funeral service since he was a little boy."
"Observing that he was looking
about him uneasily, Lebedeff asked him whom he was seeking."
“Nothing.
"I only thought I--”

“Is it Rogojin?”

“Why--is he here?”

“Yes, he’s in church.”

“I thought I caught sight of his eyes!” muttered the prince, in
confusion."
“But what of it!--Why is he here?
"Was he asked?”

“Oh, dear, no!"
"Why, they don’t even know him!"
"Anyone can come in, you
know."
Why do you look so amazed?
"I often meet him; I’ve seen him at
least four times, here at Pavlofsk, within the last week.”

“I haven’t seen him once--since that day!” the prince murmured."
"As Nastasia Philipovna had not said a word about having met Rogojin
since “that day,” the prince concluded that the latter had his own
reasons for wishing to keep out of sight."
"All the day of the funeral our
hero was in a deeply thoughtful state, while Nastasia Philipovna was
particularly merry, both in the daytime and in the evening."
"Colia had made it up with the prince before his father’s death, and it
was he who urged him to make use of Keller and Burdovsky, promising
to answer himself for the former’s behaviour."
"Nina Alexandrovna and
Lebedeff tried to persuade him to have the wedding in St. Petersburg,
instead of in the public fashion contemplated, down here at Pavlofsk
in the height of the season."
"But the prince only said that Nastasia
Philipovna desired to have it so, though he saw well enough what
prompted their arguments."
The next day Keller came to visit the prince.
"He was in a high state of
delight with the post of honour assigned to him at the wedding."
"Before entering he stopped on the threshold, raised his hand as if
making a solemn vow, and cried:

“I won’t drink!”

Then he went up to the prince, seized both his hands, shook them warmly,
and declared that he had at first felt hostile towards the project of
this marriage, and had openly said so in the billiard-rooms, but that
the reason simply was that, with the impatience of a friend, he had
hoped to see the prince marry at least a Princess de Rohan or de Chabot;
but that now he saw that the prince’s way of thinking was ten times more
noble than that of “all the rest put together.” For he desired neither
pomp nor wealth nor honour, but only the truth!"
"The sympathies of
exalted personages were well known, and the prince was too highly
placed by his education, and so on, not to be in some sense an exalted
personage!"
"“But all the common herd judge differently; in the town, at
the meetings, in the villas, at the band, in the inns and the
billiard-rooms, the coming event has only to be mentioned and there are
shouts and cries from everybody."
"I have even heard talk of getting up a
‘charivari’ under the windows on the wedding-night."
"So if ‘you have need
of the pistol’ of an honest man, prince, I am ready to fire half a dozen
shots even before you rise from your nuptial couch!”

Keller also advised, in anticipation of the crowd making a rush after
the ceremony, that a fire-hose should be placed at the entrance to the
house; but Lebedeff was opposed to this measure, which he said might
result in the place being pulled down."
"“I assure you, prince, that Lebedeff is intriguing against you."
"He wants
to put you under control."
Imagine that!
"To take ‘from you the use of
your free-will and your money’--that is to say, the two things that
distinguish us from the animals!"
I have heard it said positively.
"It is
the sober truth.”

The prince recollected that somebody had told him something of the kind
before, and he had, of course, scoffed at it."
"He only laughed now, and
forgot the hint at once."
"Lebedeff really had been busy for some little while; but, as usual, his
plans had become too complex to succeed, through sheer excess of ardour."
"When he came to the prince--the very day before the wedding--to confess
(for he always confessed to the persons against whom he intrigued,
especially when the plan failed), he informed our hero that he himself
was a born Talleyrand, but for some unknown reason had become simple
Lebedeff."
"He then proceeded to explain his whole game to the prince,
interesting the latter exceedingly."
"According to Lebedeff’s account, he had first tried what he could do
with General Epanchin."
"The latter informed him that he wished well to
the unfortunate young man, and would gladly do what he could to “save
him,” but that he did not think it would be seemly for him to interfere
in this matter."
Lizabetha Prokofievna would neither hear nor see him.
"Prince S. and Evgenie Pavlovitch only shrugged their shoulders, and
implied that it was no business of theirs."
"However, Lebedeff had not
lost heart, and went off to a clever lawyer,--a worthy and respectable
man, whom he knew well."
"This old gentleman informed him that the thing
was perfectly feasible if he could get hold of competent witnesses as
to Muishkin’s mental incapacity."
"Then, with the assistance of a few
influential persons, he would soon see the matter arranged."
"Lebedeff immediately procured the services of an old doctor, and carried
the latter away to Pavlofsk to see the prince, by way of viewing the
ground, as it were, and to give him (Lebedeff) counsel as to whether
the thing was to be done or not."
"The visit was not to be official, but
merely friendly."
Muishkin remembered the doctor’s visit quite well.
"He remembered that
Lebedeff had said that he looked ill, and had better see a doctor; and
although the prince scouted the idea, Lebedeff had turned up almost
immediately with his old friend, explaining that they had just met at
the bedside of Hippolyte, who was very ill, and that the doctor had
something to tell the prince about the sick man."
"The prince had, of course, at once received him, and had plunged into
a conversation about Hippolyte."
"He had given the doctor an account of
Hippolyte’s attempted suicide; and had proceeded thereafter to talk of
his own malady,--of Switzerland, of Schneider, and so on; and so
deeply was the old man interested by the prince’s conversation and his
description of Schneider’s system, that he sat on for two hours."
"Muishkin gave him excellent cigars to smoke, and Lebedeff, for his part,
regaled him with liqueurs, brought in by Vera, to whom the doctor--a
married man and the father of a family--addressed such compliments that
she was filled with indignation."
"They parted friends, and, after leaving
the prince, the doctor said to Lebedeff: “If all such people were put
under restraint, there would be no one left for keepers.” Lebedeff then,
in tragic tones, told of the approaching marriage, whereupon the other
nodded his head and replied that, after all, marriages like that were
not so rare; that he had heard that the lady was very fascinating and of
extraordinary beauty, which was enough to explain the infatuation of a
wealthy man; that, further, thanks to the liberality of Totski and of
Rogojin, she possessed--so he had heard--not only money, but pearls,
diamonds, shawls, and furniture, and consequently she could not be
considered a bad match."
"In brief, it seemed to the doctor that the
prince’s choice, far from being a sign of foolishness, denoted, on the
contrary, a shrewd, calculating, and practical mind."
"Lebedeff had been
much struck by this point of view, and he terminated his confession
by assuring the prince that he was ready, if need be, to shed his very
life’s blood for him."
"Hippolyte, too, was a source of some distraction to the prince at this
time; he would send for him at any and every hour of the day."
"They
lived,--Hippolyte and his mother and the children,--in a small house not
far off, and the little ones were happy, if only because they were able
to escape from the invalid into the garden."
"The prince had enough to do
in keeping the peace between the irritable Hippolyte and his mother, and
eventually the former became so malicious and sarcastic on the subject
of the approaching wedding, that Muishkin took offence at last, and
refused to continue his visits."
"A couple of days later, however, Hippolyte’s mother came with tears in
her eyes, and begged the prince to come back, “or _he_ would eat her up
bodily.” She added that Hippolyte had a great secret to disclose."
"Of
course the prince went."
"There was no secret, however, unless we reckon
certain pantings and agitated glances around (probably all put on) as
the invalid begged his visitor to “beware of Rogojin.”

“He is the sort of man,” he continued, “who won’t give up his object,
you know; he is not like you and me, prince--he belongs to quite a
different order of beings."
"If he sets his heart on a thing he won’t be
afraid of anything--” and so on."
"Hippolyte was very ill, and looked as though he could not long survive."
"He was tearful at first, but grew more and more sarcastic and malicious
as the interview proceeded."
The prince questioned him in detail as to his hints about Rogojin.
"He
was anxious to seize upon some facts which might confirm Hippolyte’s
vague warnings; but there were none; only Hippolyte’s own private
impressions and feelings."
"However, the invalid--to his immense satisfaction--ended by seriously
alarming the prince."
"At first Muishkin had not cared to make any reply to his sundry
questions, and only smiled in response to Hippolyte’s advice to “run for
his life--abroad, if necessary."
"There are Russian priests everywhere,
and one can get married all over the world.”

But it was Hippolyte’s last idea which upset him."
"“What I am really alarmed about, though,” he said, “is Aglaya Ivanovna."
Rogojin knows how you love her.
Love for love.
"You took Nastasia
Philipovna from him."
"He will murder Aglaya Ivanovna; for though she is
not yours, of course, now, still such an act would pain you,--wouldn’t
it?”

He had attained his end."
"The prince left the house beside himself with
terror."
"These warnings about Rogojin were expressed on the day before the
wedding."
"That evening the prince saw Nastasia Philipovna for the last
time before they were to meet at the altar; but Nastasia was not in a
position to give him any comfort or consolation."
"On the contrary, she
only added to his mental perturbation as the evening went on."
"Up to this
time she had invariably done her best to cheer him--she was afraid of
his looking melancholy; she would try singing to him, and telling him
every sort of funny story or reminiscence that she could recall."
"The
prince nearly always pretended to be amused, whether he were so
actually or no; but often enough he laughed sincerely, delighted by the
brilliancy of her wit when she was carried away by her narrative, as she
very often was."
"Nastasia would be wild with joy to see the impression
she had made, and to hear his laugh of real amusement; and she would
remain the whole evening in a state of pride and happiness."
"But this
evening her melancholy and thoughtfulness grew with every hour."
"The prince had told Evgenie Pavlovitch with perfect sincerity that he
loved Nastasia Philipovna with all his soul."
"In his love for her there
was the sort of tenderness one feels for a sick, unhappy child which
cannot be left alone."
"He never spoke of his feelings for Nastasia
to anyone, not even to herself."
"When they were together they never
discussed their “feelings,” and there was nothing in their cheerful,
animated conversation which an outsider could not have heard."
"Daria
Alexeyevna, with whom Nastasia was staying, told afterwards how she had
been filled with joy and delight only to look at them, all this time."
"Thanks to the manner in which he regarded Nastasia’s mental and moral
condition, the prince was to some extent freed from other perplexities."
"She was now quite different from the woman he had known three months
before."
"He was not astonished, for instance, to see her now so impatient
to marry him--she who formerly had wept with rage and hurled curses and
reproaches at him if he mentioned marriage!"
"“It shows that she no longer
fears, as she did then, that she would make me unhappy by marrying me,”
 he thought."
"And he felt sure that so sudden a change could not be a
natural one."
"This rapid growth of self-confidence could not be due only
to her hatred for Aglaya."
"To suppose that would be to suspect the depth
of her feelings."
"Nor could it arise from dread of the fate that awaited
her if she married Rogojin."
"These causes, indeed, as well as others,
might have played a part in it, but the true reason, Muishkin decided,
was the one he had long suspected--that the poor sick soul had come to
the end of its forces."
"Yet this was an explanation that did not procure
him any peace of mind."
"At times he seemed to be making violent efforts
to think of nothing, and one would have said that he looked on his
marriage as an unimportant formality, and on his future happiness as a
thing not worth considering."
"As to conversations such as the one held
with Evgenie Pavlovitch, he avoided them as far as possible, feeling
that there were certain objections to which he could make no answer."
"The prince had observed that Nastasia knew well enough what Aglaya was
to him."
"He never spoke of it, but he had seen her face when she had
caught him starting off for the Epanchins’ house on several occasions."
"When the Epanchins left Pavlofsk, she had beamed with radiance and
happiness."
"Unsuspicious and unobservant as he was, he had feared at that
time that Nastasia might have some scheme in her mind for a scene or
scandal which would drive Aglaya out of Pavlofsk."
"She had encouraged
the rumours and excitement among the inhabitants of the place as to her
marriage with the prince, in order to annoy her rival; and, finding
it difficult to meet the Epanchins anywhere, she had, on one occasion,
taken him for a drive past their house."
"He did not observe what was
happening until they were almost passing the windows, when it was too
late to do anything."
"He said nothing, but for two days afterwards he was
ill.

Nastasia did not try that particular experiment again."
"A few days before
that fixed for the wedding, she grew grave and thoughtful."
"She always
ended by getting the better of her melancholy, and becoming merry and
cheerful again, but not quite so unaffectedly happy as she had been some
days earlier."
The prince redoubled his attentive study of her symptoms.
"It was a most
curious circumstance, in his opinion, that she never spoke of Rogojin."
"But once, about five days before the wedding, when the prince was at
home, a messenger arrived begging him to come at once, as Nastasia
Philipovna was very ill."
He had found her in a condition approaching to absolute madness.
"She
screamed, and trembled, and cried out that Rogojin was hiding out there
in the garden--that she had seen him herself--and that he would murder
her in the night--that he would cut her throat."
"She was terribly
agitated all day."
"But it so happened that the prince called at
Hippolyte’s house later on, and heard from his mother that she had been
in town all day, and had there received a visit from Rogojin, who had
made inquiries about Pavlofsk."
"On inquiry, it turned out that Rogojin
visited the old lady in town at almost the same moment when Nastasia
declared that she had seen him in the garden; so that the whole thing
turned out to be an illusion on her part."
"Nastasia immediately went
across to Hippolyte’s to inquire more accurately, and returned immensely
relieved and comforted."
"On the day before the wedding, the prince left Nastasia in a state of
great animation."
"Her wedding-dress and all sorts of finery had just
arrived from town."
"Muishkin had not imagined that she would be so
excited over it, but he praised everything, and his praise rendered her
doubly happy."
"But Nastasia could not hide the cause of her intense interest in her
wedding splendour."
"She had heard of the indignation in the town, and
knew that some of the populace was getting up a sort of charivari with
music, that verses had been composed for the occasion, and that the
rest of Pavlofsk society more or less encouraged these preparations."
"So,
since attempts were being made to humiliate her, she wanted to hold her
head even higher than usual, and to overwhelm them all with the beauty
and taste of her toilette."
"“Let them shout and whistle, if they dare!”
 Her eyes flashed at the thought."
"But, underneath this, she had another
motive, of which she did not speak."
"She thought that possibly Aglaya,
or at any rate someone sent by her, would be present incognito at
the ceremony, or in the crowd, and she wished to be prepared for this
eventuality."
"The prince left her at eleven, full of these thoughts, and went home."
"But it was not twelve o’clock when a messenger came to say that Nastasia
was very bad, and he must come at once."
"On hurrying back he found his bride locked up in her own room and could
hear her hysterical cries and sobs."
"It was some time before she could be
made to hear that the prince had come, and then she opened the door only
just sufficiently to let him in, and immediately locked it behind him."
She then fell on her knees at his feet.
"(So at least Dana Alexeyevna
reported.)"
“What am I doing?
"What am I doing to you?” she sobbed convulsively,
embracing his knees."
"The prince was a whole hour soothing and comforting her, and left her,
at length, pacified and composed."
"He sent another messenger during the
night to inquire after her, and two more next morning."
"The last
brought back a message that Nastasia was surrounded by a whole army of
dressmakers and maids, and was as happy and as busy as such a beauty
should be on her wedding morning, and that there was not a vestige of
yesterday’s agitation remaining."
"The message concluded with the
news that at the moment of the bearer’s departure there was a great
confabulation in progress as to which diamonds were to be worn, and how."
This message entirely calmed the prince’s mind.
"The following report of the proceedings on the wedding day may be
depended upon, as coming from eye-witnesses."
The wedding was fixed for eight o’clock in the evening.
"Nastasia
Philipovna was ready at seven."
"From six o’clock groups of people began
to gather at Nastasia’s house, at the prince’s, and at the church door,
but more especially at the former place."
"The church began to fill at
seven."
"Colia and Vera Lebedeff were very anxious on the prince’s account, but
they were so busy over the arrangements for receiving the guests after
the wedding, that they had not much time for the indulgence of personal
feelings."
"There were to be very few guests besides the best men and so on; only
Dana Alexeyevna, the Ptitsins, Gania, and the doctor."
"When the prince
asked Lebedeff why he had invited the doctor, who was almost a stranger,
Lebedeff replied:

“Why, he wears an ‘order,’ and it looks so well!”

This idea amused the prince."
"Keller and Burdovsky looked wonderfully correct in their dress-coats and
white kid gloves, although Keller caused the bridegroom some alarm by
his undisguisedly hostile glances at the gathering crowd of sight-seers
outside."
"At about half-past seven the prince started for the church in his
carriage."
"We may remark here that he seemed anxious not to omit a single one of
the recognized customs and traditions observed at weddings."
"He wished
all to be done as openly as possible, and “in due order.”

Arrived at the church, Muishkin, under Keller’s guidance, passed
through the crowd of spectators, amid continuous whispering and excited
exclamations."
"The prince stayed near the altar, while Keller made off
once more to fetch the bride."
"On reaching the gate of Daria Alexeyevna’s house, Keller found a far
denser crowd than he had encountered at the prince’s."
"The remarks and
exclamations of the spectators here were of so irritating a nature that
Keller was very near making them a speech on the impropriety of their
conduct, but was luckily caught by Burdovsky, in the act of turning to
address them, and hurried indoors."
Nastasia Philipovna was ready.
"She rose from her seat, looked into the
glass and remarked, as Keller told the tale afterwards, that she was “as
pale as a corpse.” She then bent her head reverently, before the ikon in
the corner, and left the room."
A torrent of voices greeted her appearance at the front door.
"The crowd
whistled, clapped its hands, and laughed and shouted; but in a moment or
two isolated voices were distinguishable."
“What a beauty!” cried one.
"“Well, she isn’t the first in the world, nor the last,” said another."
"“Marriage covers everything,” observed a third."
"“I defy you to find another beauty like that,” said a fourth."
“She’s a real princess!
"I’d sell my soul for such a princess as that!”

Nastasia came out of the house looking as white as any handkerchief; but
her large dark eyes shone upon the vulgar crowd like blazing coals."
"The spectators’ cries were redoubled, and became more exultant and
triumphant every moment."
"The door of the carriage was open, and Keller
had given his hand to the bride to help her in, when suddenly with
a loud cry she rushed from him, straight into the surging crowd."
"Her
friends about her were stupefied with amazement; the crowd parted as she
rushed through it, and suddenly, at a distance of five or six yards
from the carriage, appeared Rogojin."
"It was his look that had caught her
eyes."
"Nastasia rushed to him like a madwoman, and seized both his hands."
“Save me!” she cried.
"“Take me away, anywhere you like, quick!”

Rogojin seized her in his arms and almost carried her to the carriage."
"Then, in a flash, he tore a hundred-rouble note out of his pocket and
held it to the coachman."
"“To the station, quick!"
If you catch the train you shall have another.
"Quick!”

He leaped into the carriage after Nastasia and banged the door."
"The
coachman did not hesitate a moment; he whipped up the horses, and they
were off."
"“One more second and I should have stopped him,” said Keller,
afterwards."
"In fact, he and Burdovsky jumped into another carriage and
set off in pursuit; but it struck them as they drove along that it was
not much use trying to bring Nastasia back by force."
"“Besides,” said Burdovsky, “the prince would not like it, would he?” So
they gave up the pursuit."
"Rogojin and Nastasia Philipovna reached the station just in time for the
train."
"As he jumped out of the carriage and was almost on the point
of entering the train, Rogojin accosted a young girl standing on the
platform and wearing an old-fashioned, but respectable-looking, black
cloak and a silk handkerchief over her head."
"“Take fifty roubles for your cloak?” he shouted, holding the money
out to the girl."
"Before the astonished young woman could collect her
scattered senses, he pushed the money into her hand, seized the mantle,
and threw it and the handkerchief over Nastasia’s head and shoulders."
"The latter’s wedding-array would have attracted too much attention, and
it was not until some time later that the girl understood why her old
cloak and kerchief had been bought at such a price."
"The news of what had happened reached the church with extraordinary
rapidity."
"When Keller arrived, a host of people whom he did not know
thronged around to ask him questions."
"There was much excited talking,
and shaking of heads, even some laughter; but no one left the church,
all being anxious to observe how the now celebrated bridegroom would
take the news."
"He grew very pale upon hearing it, but took it quite
quietly."
"“I was afraid,” he muttered, scarcely audibly, “but I hardly thought it
would come to this.” Then after a short silence, he added: “However, in
her state, it is quite consistent with the natural order of things.”

Even Keller admitted afterwards that this was “extraordinarily
philosophical” on the prince’s part."
"He left the church quite calm, to
all appearances, as many witnesses were found to declare afterwards."
"He
seemed anxious to reach home and be left alone as quickly as possible;
but this was not to be."
"He was accompanied by nearly all the invited
guests, and besides this, the house was almost besieged by excited bands
of people, who insisted upon being allowed to enter the verandah."
"The
prince heard Keller and Lebedeff remonstrating and quarrelling with
these unknown individuals, and soon went out himself."
"He approached
the disturbers of his peace, requested courteously to be told what was
desired; then politely putting Lebedeff and Keller aside, he addressed
an old gentleman who was standing on the verandah steps at the head of
the band of would-be guests, and courteously requested him to honour him
with a visit."
"The old fellow was quite taken aback by this, but entered,
followed by a few more, who tried to appear at their ease."
"The rest
remained outside, and presently the whole crowd was censuring those who
had accepted the invitation."
"The prince offered seats to his strange
visitors, tea was served, and a general conversation sprang up."
"Everything was done most decorously, to the considerable surprise of the
intruders."
"A few tentative attempts were made to turn the conversation
to the events of the day, and a few indiscreet questions were asked; but
Muishkin replied to everybody with such simplicity and good-humour, and
at the same time with so much dignity, and showed such confidence in the
good breeding of his guests, that the indiscreet talkers were quickly
silenced."
By degrees the conversation became almost serious.
"One
gentleman suddenly exclaimed, with great vehemence: “Whatever happens,
I shall not sell my property; I shall wait."
"Enterprise is better than
money, and there, sir, you have my whole system of economy, if you
wish!” He addressed the prince, who warmly commended his sentiments,
though Lebedeff whispered in his ear that this gentleman, who talked so
much of his “property,” had never had either house or home."
"Nearly an hour passed thus, and when tea was over the visitors seemed to
think that it was time to go."
"As they went out, the doctor and the old
gentleman bade Muishkin a warm farewell, and all the rest took their
leave with hearty protestations of good-will, dropping remarks to the
effect that “it was no use worrying,” and that “perhaps all would turn
out for the best,” and so on."
"Some of the younger intruders would have
asked for champagne, but they were checked by the older ones."
"When all
had departed, Keller leaned over to Lebedeff, and said:

“With you and me there would have been a scene."
"We should have shouted
and fought, and called in the police."
"But he has simply made some new
friends--and such friends, too!"
"I know them!”

Lebedeff, who was slightly intoxicated, answered with a sigh:

“Things are hidden from the wise and prudent, and revealed unto babes."
"I have applied those words to him before, but now I add that God has
preserved the babe himself from the abyss, He and all His saints.”

At last, about half-past ten, the prince was left alone."
His head ached.
"Colia was the last to go, after having helped him to change his wedding
clothes."
"They parted on affectionate terms, and, without speaking of
what had happened, Colia promised to come very early the next day."
"He
said later that the prince had given no hint of his intentions when they
said good-bye, but had hidden them even from him."
"Soon there was hardly
anyone left in the house."
"Burdovsky had gone to see Hippolyte; Keller
and Lebedeff had wandered off together somewhere."
"Only Vera Lebedeff remained hurriedly rearranging the furniture in
the rooms."
"As she left the verandah, she glanced at the prince."
"He was
seated at the table, with both elbows upon it, and his head resting
on his hands."
"She approached him, and touched his shoulder gently."
"The prince started and looked at her in perplexity; he seemed to be
collecting his senses for a minute or so, before he could remember where
he was."
"As recollection dawned upon him, he became violently agitated."
"All he did, however, was to ask Vera very earnestly to knock at his door
and awake him in time for the first train to Petersburg next morning."
"Vera promised, and the prince entreated her not to tell anyone of his
intention."
"She promised this, too; and at last, when she had half-closed
the door, he called her back a third time, took her hands in his, kissed
them, then kissed her forehead, and in a rather peculiar manner said to
her, “Until tomorrow!”

Such was Vera’s story afterwards."
"She went away in great anxiety about him, but when she saw him in the
morning, he seemed to be quite himself again, greeted her with a smile,
and told her that he would very likely be back by the evening."
"It
appears that he did not consider it necessary to inform anyone excepting
Vera of his departure for town."
XI.
"An hour later he was in St. Petersburg, and by ten o’clock he had rung
the bell at Rogojin’s."
"He had gone to the front door, and was kept waiting a long while before
anyone came."
"At last the door of old Mrs. Rogojin’s flat was opened, and
an aged servant appeared."
"“Parfen Semionovitch is not at home,” she announced from the doorway."
"“Whom do you want?”

“Parfen Semionovitch.”

“He is not in.”

The old woman examined the prince from head to foot with great
curiosity."
"“At all events tell me whether he slept at home last night, and whether
he came alone?”

The old woman continued to stare at him, but said nothing."
"“Was not Nastasia Philipovna here with him, yesterday evening?”

“And, pray, who are you yourself?”

“Prince Lef Nicolaievitch Muishkin; he knows me well.”

“He is not at home.”

The woman lowered her eyes."
"“And Nastasia Philipovna?”

“I know nothing about it.”

“Stop a minute!"
"When will he come back?”

“I don’t know that either.”

The door was shut with these words, and the old woman disappeared."
"The
prince decided to come back within an hour."
"Passing out of the house, he
met the porter."
“Is Parfen Semionovitch at home?” he asked.
"“Yes.”

“Why did they tell me he was not at home, then?”

“Where did they tell you so,--at his door?”

“No, at his mother’s flat; I rang at Parfen Semionovitch’s door and nobody came.”

“Well, he may have gone out."
I can’t tell.
"Sometimes he takes the keys
with him, and leaves the rooms empty for two or three days.”

“Do you know for certain that he was at home last night?”

“Yes, he was.”

“Was Nastasia Philipovna with him?”

“I don’t know; she doesn’t come often."
"I think I should have known if
she had come.”

The prince went out deep in thought, and walked up and down the pavement
for some time."
"The windows of all the rooms occupied by Rogojin were
closed, those of his mother’s apartments were open."
"It was a hot, bright
day."
"The prince crossed the road in order to have a good look at the
windows again; not only were Rogojin’s closed, but the white blinds were
all down as well."
"He stood there for a minute and then, suddenly and strangely enough, it
seemed to him that a little corner of one of the blinds was lifted,
and Rogojin’s face appeared for an instant and then vanished."
"He waited
another minute, and decided to go and ring the bell once more; however,
he thought better of it again and put it off for an hour."
"The chief object in his mind at this moment was to get as quickly as
he could to Nastasia Philipovna’s lodging."
"He remembered that, not long
since, when she had left Pavlofsk at his request, he had begged her
to put up in town at the house of a respectable widow, who had
well-furnished rooms to let, near the Ismailofsky barracks."
"Probably
Nastasia had kept the rooms when she came down to Pavlofsk this last
time; and most likely she would have spent the night in them, Rogojin
having taken her straight there from the station."
The prince took a droshky.
"It struck him as he drove on that he ought
to have begun by coming here, since it was most improbable that Rogojin
should have taken Nastasia to his own house last night."
"He remembered
that the porter said she very rarely came at all, so that it was still
less likely that she would have gone there so late at night."
"Vainly trying to comfort himself with these reflections, the prince
reached the Ismailofsky barracks more dead than alive."
"To his consternation the good people at the lodgings had not only heard
nothing of Nastasia, but all came out to look at him as if he were a
marvel of some sort."
"The whole family, of all ages, surrounded him, and
he was begged to enter."
"He guessed at once that they knew perfectly well
who he was, and that yesterday ought to have been his wedding-day; and
further that they were dying to ask about the wedding, and especially
about why he should be here now, inquiring for the woman who in all
reasonable human probability might have been expected to be with him in
Pavlofsk."
"He satisfied their curiosity, in as few words as possible, with regard
to the wedding, but their exclamations and sighs were so numerous and
sincere that he was obliged to tell the whole story--in a short form,
of course."
"The advice of all these agitated ladies was that the prince
should go at once and knock at Rogojin’s until he was let in: and when
let in insist upon a substantial explanation of everything."
"If Rogojin
was really not at home, the prince was advised to go to a certain house,
the address of which was given, where lived a German lady, a friend of
Nastasia Philipovna’s."
"It was possible that she might have spent the
night there in her anxiety to conceal herself."
The prince rose from his seat in a condition of mental collapse.
"The
good ladies reported afterwards that “his pallor was terrible to see,
and his legs seemed to give way underneath him.” With difficulty he was
made to understand that his new friends would be glad of his address, in
order to act with him if possible."
"After a moment’s thought he gave the
address of the small hotel, on the stairs of which he had had a fit some
five weeks since."
He then set off once more for Rogojin’s.
"This time they neither opened the door at Rogojin’s flat nor at the one
opposite."
"The prince found the porter with difficulty, but when found,
the man would hardly look at him or answer his questions, pretending
to be busy."
"Eventually, however, he was persuaded to reply so far as to
state that Rogojin had left the house early in the morning and gone to
Pavlofsk, and that he would not return today at all."
"“I shall wait; he may come back this evening.”

“He may not be home for a week.”

“Then, at all events, he _did_ sleep here, did he?”

“Well--he did sleep here, yes.”

All this was suspicious and unsatisfactory."
"Very likely the porter had
received new instructions during the interval of the prince’s absence;
his manner was so different now."
"He had been obliging--now he was as
obstinate and silent as a mule."
"However, the prince decided to call
again in a couple of hours, and after that to watch the house, in case
of need."
"His hope was that he might yet find Nastasia at the address
which he had just received."
"To that address he now set off at full
speed."
But alas!
"at the German lady’s house they did not even appear to
understand what he wanted."
"After a while, by means of certain hints, he
was able to gather that Nastasia must have had a quarrel with her friend
two or three weeks ago, since which date the latter had neither heard
nor seen anything of her."
"He was given to understand that the subject of
Nastasia’s present whereabouts was not of the slightest interest to her;
and that Nastasia might marry all the princes in the world for all she
cared!"
So Muishkin took his leave hurriedly.
"It struck him now that she
might have gone away to Moscow just as she had done the last time, and
that Rogojin had perhaps gone after her, or even _with_ her."
"If only he
could find some trace!"
"However, he must take his room at the hotel; and he started off in that
direction."
"Having engaged his room, he was asked by the waiter whether
he would take dinner; replying mechanically in the affirmative, he sat
down and waited; but it was not long before it struck him that dining
would delay him."
"Enraged at this idea, he started up, crossed the
dark passage (which filled him with horrible impressions and gloomy
forebodings), and set out once more for Rogojin’s."
"Rogojin had not
returned, and no one came to the door."
"He rang at the old lady’s door
opposite, and was informed that Parfen Semionovitch would not return for
three days."
"The curiosity with which the old servant stared at him again
impressed the prince disagreeably."
"He could not find the porter this
time at all."
"As before, he crossed the street and watched the windows from the other
side, walking up and down in anguish of soul for half an hour or so in
the stifling heat."
"Nothing stirred; the blinds were motionless; indeed,
the prince began to think that the apparition of Rogojin’s face could
have been nothing but fancy."
"Soothed by this thought, he drove off once
more to his friends at the Ismailofsky barracks."
"He was expected
there."
"The mother had already been to three or four places to look for
Nastasia, but had not found a trace of any kind."
"The prince said nothing, but entered the room, sat down silently, and
stared at them, one after the other, with the air of a man who cannot
understand what is being said to him."
"It was strange--one moment he
seemed to be so observant, the next so absent; his behaviour struck
all the family as most remarkable."
"At length he rose from his seat, and
begged to be shown Nastasia’s rooms."
"The ladies reported afterwards how
he had examined everything in the apartments."
"He observed an open book
on the table, Madam Bovary, and requested the leave of the lady of the
house to take it with him."
"He had turned down the leaf at the open page,
and pocketed it before they could explain that it was a library book."
"He
had then seated himself by the open window, and seeing a card-table, he
asked who played cards."
"He was informed that Nastasia used to play with Rogojin every evening,
either at “preference” or “little fool,” or “whist”; that this had been
their practice since her last return from Pavlofsk; that she had taken
to this amusement because she did not like to see Rogojin sitting silent
and dull for whole evenings at a time; that the day after Nastasia had
made a remark to this effect, Rogojin had whipped a pack of cards out
of his pocket."
"Nastasia had laughed, but soon they began playing."
"The
prince asked where were the cards, but was told that Rogojin used to
bring a new pack every day, and always carried it away in his pocket."
"The good ladies recommended the prince to try knocking at Rogojin’s once
more--not at once, but in the evening."
"Meanwhile, the mother would go to
Pavlofsk to inquire at Dana Alexeyevna’s whether anything had been heard
of Nastasia there."
"The prince was to come back at ten o’clock and meet
her, to hear her news and arrange plans for the morrow."
"In spite of the kindly-meant consolations of his new friends, the prince
walked to his hotel in inexpressible anguish of spirit, through the hot,
dusty streets, aimlessly staring at the faces of those who passed him."
"Arrived at his destination, he determined to rest awhile in his room
before he started for Rogojin’s once more."
"He sat down, rested his
elbows on the table and his head on his hands, and fell to thinking."
Heaven knows how long and upon what subjects he thought.
"He thought
of many things--of Vera Lebedeff, and of her father; of Hippolyte; of
Rogojin himself, first at the funeral, then as he had met him in the
park, then, suddenly, as they had met in this very passage, outside,
when Rogojin had watched in the darkness and awaited him with uplifted
knife."
"The prince remembered his enemy’s eyes as they had glared at him
in the darkness."
"He shuddered, as a sudden idea struck him."
"This idea was, that if Rogojin were in Petersburg, though he might hide
for a time, yet he was quite sure to come to him--the prince--before
long, with either good or evil intentions, but probably with the same
intention as on that other occasion."
"At all events, if Rogojin were to
come at all he would be sure to seek the prince here--he had no other
town address--perhaps in this same corridor; he might well seek him here
if he needed him."
And perhaps he did need him.
"This idea seemed quite
natural to the prince, though he could not have explained why he should
so suddenly have become necessary to Rogojin."
"Rogojin would not come if
all were well with him, that was part of the thought; he would come if
all were not well; and certainly, undoubtedly, all would not be well
with him."
"The prince could not bear this new idea; he took his hat and
rushed out towards the street."
It was almost dark in the passage.
"“What if he were to come out of that corner as I go by and--and stop
me?” thought the prince, as he approached the familiar spot."
"But no one
came out."
He passed under the gateway and into the street.
"The crowds of people
walking about--as is always the case at sunset in Petersburg, during the
summer--surprised him, but he walked on in the direction of Rogojin’s
house."
"About fifty yards from the hotel, at the first cross-road, as he passed
through the crowd of foot-passengers sauntering along, someone touched
his shoulder, and said in a whisper into his ear:

“Lef Nicolaievitch, my friend, come along with me.” It was Rogojin."
"The prince immediately began to tell him, eagerly and joyfully, how he
had but the moment before expected to see him in the dark passage of the
hotel."
"“I was there,” said Rogojin, unexpectedly."
"“Come along.” The prince was
surprised at this answer; but his astonishment increased a couple of
minutes afterwards, when he began to consider it."
"Having thought it
over, he glanced at Rogojin in alarm."
"The latter was striding along a
yard or so ahead, looking straight in front of him, and mechanically
making way for anyone he met."
"“Why did you not ask for me at my room if you were in the hotel?” asked
the prince, suddenly."
"Rogojin stopped and looked at him; then reflected, and replied as though
he had not heard the question:

“Look here, Lef Nicolaievitch, you go straight on to the house; I shall
walk on the other side."
"See that we keep together.”

So saying, Rogojin crossed the road."
"Arrived on the opposite pavement, he looked back to see whether the
prince were moving, waved his hand in the direction of the Gorohovaya,
and strode on, looking across every moment to see whether Muishkin
understood his instructions."
"The prince supposed that Rogojin desired to
look out for someone whom he was afraid to miss; but if so, why had he
not told _him_ whom to look out for?"
"So the two proceeded for half a mile
or so."
Suddenly the prince began to tremble from some unknown cause.
"He
could not bear it, and signalled to Rogojin across the road."
The latter came at once.
"“Is Nastasia Philipovna at your house?”

“Yes.”

“And was it you looked out of the window under the blind this morning?”

“Yes.”

“Then why did--”

But the prince could not finish his question; he did not know what to
say."
"Besides this, his heart was beating so that he found it difficult
to speak at all."
"Rogojin was silent also and looked at him as before,
with an expression of deep thoughtfulness."
"“Well, I’m going,” he said, at last, preparing to recross the road."
"“You
go along here as before; we will keep to different sides of the road;
it’s better so, you’ll see.”

When they reached the Gorohovaya, and came near the house, the prince’s
legs were trembling so that he could hardly walk."
"It was about ten
o’clock."
"The old lady’s windows were open, as before; Rogojin’s were
all shut, and in the darkness the white blinds showed whiter than ever."
"Rogojin and the prince each approached the house on his respective side
of the road; Rogojin, who was on the near side, beckoned the prince
across."
He went over to the doorway.
“Even the porter does not know that I have come home now.
"I told him,
and told them at my mother’s too, that I was off to Pavlofsk,” said
Rogojin, with a cunning and almost satisfied smile."
"“We’ll go in quietly
and nobody will hear us.”

He had the key in his hand."
"Mounting the staircase he turned and
signalled to the prince to go more softly; he opened the door very
quietly, let the prince in, followed him, locked the door behind him,
and put the key in his pocket."
"“Come along,” he whispered."
He had spoken in a whisper all the way.
"In spite of his apparent outward
composure, he was evidently in a state of great mental agitation."
"Arrived in a large salon, next to the study, he went to the window and
cautiously beckoned the prince up to him."
“When you rang the bell this morning I thought it must be you.
"I went to
the door on tip-toe and heard you talking to the servant opposite."
"I had
told her before that if anyone came and rang--especially you, and I gave
her your name--she was not to tell about me."
"Then I thought, what if
he goes and stands opposite and looks up, or waits about to watch the
house?"
"So I came to this very window, looked out, and there you were
staring straight at me."
"That’s how it came about.”

“Where is Nastasia Philipovna?” asked the prince, breathlessly."
"“She’s here,” replied Rogojin, slowly, after a slight pause."
"“Where?”

Rogojin raised his eyes and gazed intently at the prince."
"“Come,” he said."
"He continued to speak in a whisper, very deliberately as before, and
looked strangely thoughtful and dreamy."
"Even while he told the story of
how he had peeped through the blind, he gave the impression of wishing
to say something else."
They entered the study.
"In this room some changes
had taken place since the prince last saw it."
"It was now divided into
two equal parts by a heavy green silk curtain stretched across it,
separating the alcove beyond, where stood Rogojin’s bed, from the rest
of the room."
"The heavy curtain was drawn now, and it was very dark."
"The bright
Petersburg summer nights were already beginning to close in, and but for
the full moon, it would have been difficult to distinguish anything in
Rogojin’s dismal room, with the drawn blinds."
"They could just see one
anothers faces, however, though not in detail."
"Rogojin’s face was white,
as usual."
His glittering eyes watched the prince with an intent stare.
“Had you not better light a candle?” said Muishkin.
"“No, I needn’t,” replied Rogojin, and taking the other by the hand he
drew him down to a chair."
"He himself took a chair opposite and drew it
up so close that he almost pressed against the prince’s knees."
"At their
side was a little round table."
"“Sit down,” said Rogojin; “let’s rest a bit.” There was silence for a
moment."
"“I knew you would be at that hotel,” he continued, just as men sometimes
commence a serious conversation by discussing any outside subject before
leading up to the main point."
"“As I entered the passage it struck me
that perhaps you were sitting and waiting for me, just as I was waiting
for you."
"Have you been to the old lady at Ismailofsky barracks?”

“Yes,” said the prince, squeezing the word out with difficulty owing to
the dreadful beating of his heart."
“I thought you would.
"‘They’ll talk about it,’ I thought; so I
determined to go and fetch you to spend the night here--‘We will be
together,’ I thought, ‘for this one night--’”

“Rogojin, _where_ is Nastasia Philipovna?” said the prince, suddenly
rising from his seat."
"He was quaking in all his limbs, and his words
came in a scarcely audible whisper."
Rogojin rose also.
"“There,” he whispered, nodding his head towards the curtain."
“Asleep?” whispered the prince.
"Rogojin looked intently at him again, as before."
"“Let’s go in--but you mustn’t--well--let’s go in.”

He lifted the curtain, paused--and turned to the prince."
"“Go in,” he
said, motioning him to pass behind the curtain."
Muishkin went in.
"“It’s so dark,” he said."
"“You can see quite enough,” muttered Rogojin."
"“I can just see there’s a bed--”

“Go nearer,” suggested Rogojin, softly."
The prince took a step forward--then another--and paused.
"He stood and
stared for a minute or two."
Neither of the men spoke a word while at the bedside.
"The prince’s heart
beat so loud that its knocking seemed to be distinctly audible in the
deathly silence."
"But now his eyes had become so far accustomed to the darkness that he
could distinguish the whole of the bed."
"Someone was asleep upon
it--in an absolutely motionless sleep."
"Not the slightest movement was
perceptible, not the faintest breathing could be heard."
"The sleeper
was covered with a white sheet; the outline of the limbs was hardly
distinguishable."
"He could only just make out that a human being lay
outstretched there."
"All around, on the bed, on a chair beside it, on the floor, were
scattered the different portions of a magnificent white silk dress, bits
of lace, ribbons and flowers."
"On a small table at the bedside glittered
a mass of diamonds, torn off and thrown down anyhow."
"From under a heap
of lace at the end of the bed peeped a small white foot, which looked as
though it had been chiselled out of marble; it was terribly still."
"The prince gazed and gazed, and felt that the more he gazed the more
death-like became the silence."
"Suddenly a fly awoke somewhere, buzzed
across the room, and settled on the pillow."
The prince shuddered.
"“Let’s go,” said Rogojin, touching his shoulder."
"They left the alcove
and sat down in the two chairs they had occupied before, opposite to one
another."
"The prince trembled more and more violently, and never took his
questioning eyes off Rogojin’s face."
"“I see you are shuddering, Lef Nicolaievitch,” said the latter, at
length, “almost as you did once in Moscow, before your fit; don’t you
remember?"
"I don’t know what I shall do with you--”

The prince bent forward to listen, putting all the strain he could
muster upon his understanding in order to take in what Rogojin said, and
continuing to gaze at the latter’s face."
"“Was it you?” he muttered, at last, motioning with his head towards the
curtain."
"“Yes, it was I,” whispered Rogojin, looking down."
Neither spoke for five minutes.
"“Because, you know,” Rogojin recommenced, as though continuing a former
sentence, “if you were ill now, or had a fit, or screamed, or anything,
they might hear it in the yard, or even in the street, and guess that
someone was passing the night in the house."
"They would all come and
knock and want to come in, because they know I am not at home."
"I didn’t
light a candle for the same reason."
"When I am not here--for two or
three days at a time, now and then--no one comes in to tidy the house
or anything; those are my orders."
"So that I want them to not know we are
spending the night here--”

“Wait,” interrupted the prince."
"“I asked both the porter and the woman
whether Nastasia Philipovna had spent last night in the house; so they
knew--”

“I know you asked."
"I told them that she had called in for ten minutes,
and then gone straight back to Pavlofsk."
No one knows she slept here.
Last night we came in just as carefully as you and I did today.
"I
thought as I came along with her that she would not like to creep in so
secretly, but I was quite wrong."
"She whispered, and walked on tip-toe;
she carried her skirt over her arm, so that it shouldn’t rustle, and
she held up her finger at me on the stairs, so that I shouldn’t make
a noise--it was you she was afraid of."
"She was mad with terror in the
train, and she begged me to bring her to this house."
"I thought of taking
her to her rooms at the Ismailofsky barracks first; but she wouldn’t
hear of it."
"She said, ‘No--not there; he’ll find me out at once there."
"Take me to your own house, where you can hide me, and tomorrow we’ll set
off for Moscow.’ Thence she would go to Orel, she said."
"When she went to
bed, she was still talking about going to Orel.”

“Wait!"
"What do you intend to do now, Parfen?”

“Well, I’m afraid of you."
You shudder and tremble so.
"We’ll pass the
night here together."
"There are no other beds besides that one; but I’ve
thought how we’ll manage."
"I’ll take the cushions off all the sofas, and
lay them down on the floor, up against the curtain here--for you and
me--so that we shall be together."
"For if they come in and look about
now, you know, they’ll find her, and carry her away, and they’ll be
asking me questions, and I shall say I did it, and then they’ll take me
away, too, don’t you see?"
"So let her lie close to us--close to you and
me."
"“Yes, yes,” agreed the prince, warmly."
"“So we will not say anything about it, or let them take her away?”

“Not for anything!” cried the other; “no, no, no!”

“So I had decided, my friend; not to give her up to anyone,” continued
Rogojin."
“We’ll be very quiet.
"I have only been out of the house one
hour all day, all the rest of the time I have been with her."
"I dare say
the air is very bad here."
It is so hot.
"Do you find it bad?”

“I don’t know--perhaps--by morning it will be.”

“I’ve covered her with oilcloth--best American oilcloth, and put
the sheet over that, and four jars of disinfectant, on account of the
smell--as they did at Moscow--you remember?"
"And she’s lying so still;
you shall see, in the morning, when it’s light."
What!
"can’t you get up?”
 asked Rogojin, seeing the other was trembling so that he could not rise
from his seat."
"“My legs won’t move,” said the prince; “it’s fear, I know."
"When my fear
is over, I’ll get up--”

“Wait a bit--I’ll make the bed, and you can lie down."
"I’ll lie down,
too, and we’ll listen and watch, for I don’t know yet what I shall do..."
"I tell you beforehand, so that you may be ready in case I--”

Muttering these disconnected words, Rogojin began to make up the beds."
"It was clear that he had devised these beds long before; last night he
slept on the sofa."
"But there was no room for two on the sofa, and he
seemed anxious that he and the prince should be close to one another;
therefore, he now dragged cushions of all sizes and shapes from the
sofas, and made a sort of bed of them close by the curtain."
"He then
approached the prince, and gently helped him to rise, and led him
towards the bed."
"But the prince could now walk by himself, so that his
fear must have passed; for all that, however, he continued to shudder."
"“It’s hot weather, you see,” continued Rogojin, as he lay down on the
cushions beside Muishkin, “and, naturally, there will be a smell."
"I
daren’t open the window."
"My mother has some beautiful flowers in pots;
they have a delicious scent; I thought of fetching them in, but that old
servant will find out, she’s very inquisitive.”

“Yes, she is inquisitive,” assented the prince."
"“I thought of buying flowers, and putting them all round her; but I was
afraid it would make us sad to see her with flowers round her.”

“Look here,” said the prince; he was bewildered, and his brain wandered."
"He seemed to be continually groping for the questions he wished to ask,
and then losing them."
"“Listen--tell me--how did you--with a knife?--That
same one?”

“Yes, that same one.”

“Wait a minute, I want to ask you something else, Parfen; all sorts of
things; but tell me first, did you intend to kill her before my wedding,
at the church door, with your knife?”

“I don’t know whether I did or not,” said Rogojin, drily, seeming to be
a little astonished at the question, and not quite taking it in."
“Did you never take your knife to Pavlofsk with you?” “No.
"As to the
knife,” he added, “this is all I can tell you about it.” He was silent
for a moment, and then said, “I took it out of the locked drawer this
morning about three, for it was in the early morning all this--happened."
"It has been inside the book ever since--and--and--this is what is such
a marvel to me, the knife only went in a couple of inches at most, just
under her left breast, and there wasn’t more than half a tablespoonful
of blood altogether, not more.”

“Yes--yes--yes--” The prince jumped up in extraordinary agitation."
"“I know, I know, I’ve read of that sort of thing--it’s internal
haemorrhage, you know."
"Sometimes there isn’t a drop--if the blow goes
straight to the heart--”

“Wait--listen!” cried Rogojin, suddenly, starting up."
"“Somebody’s
walking about, do you hear?"
In the hall.” Both sat up to listen.
"“I hear,” said the prince in a whisper, his eyes fixed on Rogojin."
"“Footsteps?”

“Yes.”

“Shall we shut the door, and lock it, or not?”

“Yes, lock it.”

They locked the door, and both lay down again."
There was a long silence.
"“Yes, by-the-by,” whispered the prince, hurriedly and excitedly as
before, as though he had just seized hold of an idea and was afraid of
losing it again."
“I--I wanted those cards!
"They say you played cards
with her?”

“Yes, I played with her,” said Rogojin, after a short silence."
"“Where are the cards?”

“Here they are,” said Rogojin, after a still longer pause."
"He pulled out a pack of cards, wrapped in a bit of paper, from his
pocket, and handed them to the prince."
"The latter took them, with a sort
of perplexity."
"A new, sad, helpless feeling weighed on his heart; he had
suddenly realized that not only at this moment, but for a long while,
he had not been saying what he wanted to say, had not been acting as he
wanted to act; and that these cards which he held in his hand, and which
he had been so delighted to have at first, were now of no use--no use..."
"He rose, and wrung his hands."
"Rogojin lay motionless, and seemed neither
to hear nor see his movements; but his eyes blazed in the darkness, and
were fixed in a wild stare."
"The prince sat down on a chair, and watched him in alarm."
"Half an hour
went by."
"Suddenly Rogojin burst into a loud abrupt laugh, as though he had quite
forgotten that they must speak in whispers."
"“That officer, eh!--that young officer--don’t you remember that fellow
at the band?"
Eh?
"Ha, ha, ha!"
"Didn’t she whip him smartly, eh?”

The prince jumped up from his seat in renewed terror."
"When Rogojin
quieted down (which he did at once) the prince bent over him, sat down
beside him, and with painfully beating heart and still more painful
breath, watched his face intently."
"Rogojin never turned his head, and
seemed to have forgotten all about him."
The prince watched and waited.
Time went on--it began to grow light.
"Rogojin began to wander--muttering disconnectedly; then he took to
shouting and laughing."
"The prince stretched out a trembling hand and
gently stroked his hair and his cheeks--he could do nothing more."
"His
legs trembled again and he seemed to have lost the use of them."
"A
new sensation came over him, filling his heart and soul with infinite
anguish."
"Meanwhile the daylight grew full and strong; and at last the prince
lay down, as though overcome by despair, and laid his face against the
white, motionless face of Rogojin."
"His tears flowed on to Rogojin’s
cheek, though he was perhaps not aware of them himself."
"At all events when, after many hours, the door was opened and people
thronged in, they found the murderer unconscious and in a raging fever."
"The prince was sitting by him, motionless, and each time that the sick
man gave a laugh, or a shout, he hastened to pass his own trembling hand
over his companion’s hair and cheeks, as though trying to soothe and
quiet him."
But alas!
"he understood nothing of what was said to him, and
recognized none of those who surrounded him."
"If Schneider himself had arrived then and seen his former pupil and
patient, remembering the prince’s condition during the first year in
Switzerland, he would have flung up his hands, despairingly, and cried,
as he did then:

“An idiot!”

XII."
"When the widow hurried away to Pavlofsk, she went straight to Daria
Alexeyevna’s house, and telling all she knew, threw her into a state of
great alarm."
"Both ladies decided to communicate at once with Lebedeff,
who, as the friend and landlord of the prince, was also much agitated."
"Vera Lebedeff told all she knew, and by Lebedeff’s advice it was decided
that all three should go to Petersburg as quickly as possible, in order
to avert “what might so easily happen.”

This is how it came about that at eleven o’clock next morning Rogojin’s
flat was opened by the police in the presence of Lebedeff, the two
ladies, and Rogojin’s own brother, who lived in the wing."
"The evidence of the porter went further than anything else towards the
success of Lebedeff in gaining the assistance of the police."
"He declared
that he had seen Rogojin return to the house last night, accompanied by
a friend, and that both had gone upstairs very secretly and cautiously."
"After this there was no hesitation about breaking open the door, since
it could not be got open in any other way."
Rogojin suffered from brain fever for two months.
"When he recovered from
the attack he was at once brought up on trial for murder."
"He gave full, satisfactory, and direct evidence on every point; and the
prince’s name was, thanks to this, not brought into the proceedings."
Rogojin was very quiet during the progress of the trial.
"He did not
contradict his clever and eloquent counsel, who argued that the brain
fever, or inflammation of the brain, was the cause of the crime;
clearly proving that this malady had existed long before the murder was
perpetrated, and had been brought on by the sufferings of the accused."
"But Rogojin added no words of his own in confirmation of this view, and
as before, he recounted with marvellous exactness the details of
his crime."
"He was convicted, but with extenuating circumstances, and
condemned to hard labour in Siberia for fifteen years."
"He heard his
sentence grimly, silently, and thoughtfully."
"His colossal fortune, with
the exception of the comparatively small portion wasted in the first
wanton period of his inheritance, went to his brother, to the great
satisfaction of the latter."
"The old lady, Rogojin’s mother, is still alive, and remembers her
favourite son Parfen sometimes, but not clearly."
"God spared her the
knowledge of this dreadful calamity which had overtaken her house."
"Lebedeff, Keller, Gania, Ptitsin, and many other friends of ours
continue to live as before."
"There is scarcely any change in them, so
that there is no need to tell of their subsequent doings."
"Hippolyte died in great agitation, and rather sooner than he expected,
about a fortnight after Nastasia Philipovna’s death."
"Colia was much
affected by these events, and drew nearer to his mother in heart and
sympathy."
"Nina Alexandrovna is anxious, because he is “thoughtful beyond
his years,” but he will, we think, make a useful and active man."
"The prince’s further fate was more or less decided by Colia, who
selected, out of all the persons he had met during the last six or seven
months, Evgenie Pavlovitch, as friend and confidant."
"To him he made over
all that he knew as to the events above recorded, and as to the present
condition of the prince."
He was not far wrong in his choice.
"Evgenie
Pavlovitch took the deepest interest in the fate of the unfortunate
“idiot,” and, thanks to his influence, the prince found himself once
more with Dr. Schneider, in Switzerland."
"Evgenie Pavlovitch, who went abroad at this time, intending to live a
long while on the continent, being, as he often said, quite superfluous
in Russia, visits his sick friend at Schneider’s every few months."
"But Dr. Schneider frowns ever more and more and shakes his head; he
hints that the brain is fatally injured; he does not as yet declare that
his patient is incurable, but he allows himself to express the gravest
fears."
"Evgenie takes this much to heart, and he has a heart, as is proved
by the fact that he receives and even answers letters from Colia."
"But
besides this, another trait in his character has become apparent, and as
it is a good trait we will make haste to reveal it."
"After each visit
to Schneider’s establishment, Evgenie Pavlovitch writes another letter,
besides that to Colia, giving the most minute particulars concerning the
invalid’s condition."
"In these letters is to be detected, and in each one
more than the last, a growing feeling of friendship and sympathy."
"The individual who corresponds thus with Evgenie Pavlovitch, and who
engages so much of his attention and respect, is Vera Lebedeff."
"We have
never been able to discover clearly how such relations sprang up."
"Of course the root of them was in the events which we have already
recorded, and which so filled Vera with grief on the prince’s account
that she fell seriously ill."
"But exactly how the acquaintance and
friendship came about, we cannot say."
"We have spoken of these letters chiefly because in them is often to be
found some news of the Epanchin family, and of Aglaya in particular."
"Evgenie Pavlovitch wrote of her from Paris, that after a short and
sudden attachment to a certain Polish count, an exile, she had suddenly
married him, quite against the wishes of her parents, though they had
eventually given their consent through fear of a terrible scandal."
"Then, after a six months’ silence, Evgenie Pavlovitch informed his
correspondent, in a long letter, full of detail, that while paying his
last visit to Dr. Schneider’s establishment, he had there come across
the whole Epanchin family (excepting the general, who had remained in
St. Petersburg) and Prince S. The meeting was a strange one."
"They
all received Evgenie Pavlovitch with effusive delight; Adelaida and
Alexandra were deeply grateful to him for his “angelic kindness to the
unhappy prince.”

Lizabetha Prokofievna, when she saw poor Muishkin, in his enfeebled and
humiliated condition, had wept bitterly."
"Apparently all was forgiven
him."
Prince S. had made a few just and sensible remarks.
"It seemed to Evgenie
Pavlovitch that there was not yet perfect harmony between Adelaida and
her fiance, but he thought that in time the impulsive young girl would
let herself be guided by his reason and experience."
"Besides, the recent
events that had befallen her family had given Adelaida much to think
about, especially the sad experiences of her younger sister."
"Within six
months, everything that the family had dreaded from the marriage with
the Polish count had come to pass."
"He turned out to be neither count
nor exile--at least, in the political sense of the word--but had had to
leave his native land owing to some rather dubious affair of the past."
"It was his noble patriotism, of which he made a great display, that
had rendered him so interesting in Aglaya’s eyes."
"She was so fascinated
that, even before marrying him, she joined a committee that had been
organized abroad to work for the restoration of Poland; and further,
she visited the confessional of a celebrated Jesuit priest, who made an
absolute fanatic of her."
"The supposed fortune of the count had dwindled
to a mere nothing, although he had given almost irrefutable evidence of
its existence to Lizabetha Prokofievna and Prince S.

Besides this, before they had been married half a year, the count and
his friend the priest managed to bring about a quarrel between Aglaya
and her family, so that it was now several months since they had seen
her."
"In a word, there was a great deal to say; but Mrs. Epanchin, and
her daughters, and even Prince S., were still so much distressed by
Aglaya’s latest infatuations and adventures, that they did not care to
talk of them, though they must have known that Evgenie knew much of the
story already."
"Poor Lizabetha Prokofievna was most anxious to get home, and, according
to Evgenie’s account, she criticized everything foreign with much
hostility."
"“They can’t bake bread anywhere, decently; and they all freeze in their
houses, during winter, like a lot of mice in a cellar."
"At all events,
I’ve had a good Russian cry over this poor fellow,” she added, pointing
to the prince, who had not recognized her in the slightest degree."
“So enough of this nonsense; it’s time we faced the truth.
"All this
continental life, all this Europe of yours, and all the trash about
‘going abroad’ is simply foolery, and it is mere foolery on our part
to come."
"Remember what I say, my friend; you’ll live to agree with me
yourself.”

So spoke the good lady, almost angrily, as she took leave of Evgenie
Pavlovitch."
"﻿PART I




CHAPTER I."
"INTRODUCTORY

SOME DETAILS OF THE BIOGRAPHY OF THAT HIGHLY RESPECTED GENTLEMAN STEPAN
TROFIMOVITCH VERHOVENSKY."
"I

IN UNDERTAKING to describe the recent and strange incidents in our town,
till lately wrapped in uneventful obscurity, I find myself forced in
absence of literary skill to begin my story rather far back, that is
to say, with certain biographical details concerning that talented and
highly-esteemed gentleman, Stepan Trofimovitch Verhovensky."
"I trust that
these details may at least serve as an introduction, while my projected
story itself will come later."
"I will say at once that Stepan Trofimovitch had always filled a
particular rôle among us, that of the progressive patriot, so to say,
and he was passionately fond of playing the part--so much so that I
really believe he could not have existed without it."
"Not that I would
put him on a level with an actor at a theatre, God forbid, for I really
have a respect for him."
"This may all have been the effect of habit, or
rather, more exactly of a generous propensity he had from his earliest
years for indulging in an agreeable day-dream in which he figured as
a picturesque public character."
"He fondly loved, for instance, his
position as a ""persecuted"" man and, so to speak, an ""exile."""
"There is a
sort of traditional glamour about those two little words that fascinated
him once for all and, exalting him gradually in his own opinion, raised
him in the course of years to a lofty pedestal very gratifying to
vanity."
"In an English satire of the last century, Gulliver, returning
from the land of the Lilliputians where the people were only three or
four inches high, had grown so accustomed to consider himself a giant
among them, that as he walked along the streets of London he could not
help crying out to carriages and passers-by to be careful and get out of
his way for fear he should crush them, imagining that they were little
and he was still a giant."
"He was laughed at and abused for it, and rough
coachmen even lashed at the giant with their whips."
But was that just?
What may not be done by habit?
"Habit had brought Stepan Trofimovitch
almost to the same position, but in a more innocent and inoffensive
form, if one may use such expressions, for he was a most excellent man."
"I am even inclined to suppose that towards the end he had been entirely
forgotten everywhere; but still it cannot be said that his name had
never been known."
"It is beyond question that he had at one time belonged
to a certain distinguished constellation of celebrated leaders of
the last generation, and at one time--though only for the briefest
moment--his name was pronounced by many hasty persons of that day almost
as though it were on a level with the names of Tchaadaev, of Byelinsky,
of Granovsky, and of Herzen, who had only just begun to write abroad."
"But Stepan Trofimovitch's activity ceased almost at the moment it began,
owing, so to say, to a ""vortex of combined circumstances."""
"And would you
believe it?"
"It turned out afterwards that there had been no ""vortex"" and
even no ""circumstances,"" at least in that connection."
"I only learned
the other day to my intense amazement, though on the most unimpeachable
authority, that Stepan Trofimovitch had lived among us in our province
not as an ""exile"" as we were accustomed to believe, and had never even
been under police supervision at all."
Such is the force of imagination!
"All his life he sincerely believed that in certain spheres he was a
constant cause of apprehension, that every step he took was watched
and noted, and that each one of the three governors who succeeded one
another during twenty years in our province came with special and uneasy
ideas concerning him, which had, by higher powers, been impressed upon
each before everything else, on receiving the appointment."
"Had anyone
assured the honest man on the most irrefutable grounds that he had
nothing to be afraid of, he would certainly have been offended."
"Yet
Stepan Trofimovitch was a most intelligent and gifted man, even, so to
say, a man of science, though indeed, in science... well, in fact he
had not done such great things in science."
"I believe indeed he had done
nothing at all."
"But that's very often the case, of course, with men of
science among us in Russia."
"He came back from abroad and was brilliant in the capacity of lecturer
at the university, towards the end of the forties."
"He only had time
to deliver a few lectures, I believe they were about the Arabs; he
maintained, too, a brilliant thesis on the political and Hanseatic
importance of the German town Hanau, of which there was promise in the
epoch between 1413 and 1428, and on the special and obscure reasons
why that promise was never fulfilled."
"This dissertation was a cruel
and skilful thrust at the Slavophils of the day, and at once made him
numerous and irreconcilable enemies among them."
"Later on--after he had
lost his post as lecturer, however--he published (by way of revenge,
so to say, and to show them what a man they had lost) in a progressive
monthly review, which translated Dickens and advocated the views of
George Sand, the beginning of a very profound investigation into the
causes, I believe, of the extraordinary moral nobility of certain
knights at a certain epoch or something of that nature."
"Some lofty and exceptionally noble idea was maintained in it, anyway."
"It was said afterwards that the continuation was hurriedly forbidden and
even that the progressive review had to suffer for having printed the
first part."
"That may very well have been so, for what was not possible
in those days?"
"Though, in this case, it is more likely that there
was nothing of the kind, and that the author himself was too lazy to
conclude his essay."
"He cut short his lectures on the Arabs because,
somehow and by someone (probably one of his reactionary enemies) a
letter had been seized giving an account of certain circumstances, in
consequence of which someone had demanded an explanation from him."
"I
don't know whether the story is true, but it was asserted that at the
same time there was discovered in Petersburg a vast, unnatural, and
illegal conspiracy of thirty people which almost shook society to its
foundations."
"It was said that they were positively on the point of
translating Fourier."
"As though of design a poem of Stepan Trofimovitch's
was seized in Moscow at that very time, though it had been written six
years before in Berlin in his earliest youth, and manuscript copies had
been passed round a circle consisting of two poetical amateurs and one
student."
This poem is lying now on my table.
"No longer ago than last
year I received a recent copy in his own handwriting from Stepan
Trofimovitch himself, signed by him, and bound in a splendid red leather
binding."
"It is not without poetic merit, however, and even a certain
talent."
"It's strange, but in those days (or to be more exact, in the
thirties) people were constantly composing in that style."
"I find it
difficult to describe the subject, for I really do not understand it."
"It is some sort of an allegory in lyrical-dramatic form, recalling the
second part of Faust."
"The scene opens with a chorus of women, followed
by a chorus of men, then a chorus of incorporeal powers of some sort,
and at the end of all a chorus of spirits not yet living but very
eager to come to life."
"All these choruses sing about something very
indefinite, for the most part about somebody's curse, but with a tinge
of the higher humour."
But the scene is suddenly changed.
"There begins a
sort of ""festival of life"" at which even insects sing, a tortoise
comes on the scene with certain sacramental Latin words, and even, if
I remember aright, a mineral sings about something that is a quite
inanimate object."
"In fact, they all sing continually, or if they
converse, it is simply to abuse one another vaguely, but again with
a tinge of higher meaning."
"At last the scene is changed again; a
wilderness appears, and among the rocks there wanders a civilized young
man who picks and sucks certain herbs."
"Asked by a fairy why he sucks
these herbs, he answers that, conscious of a superfluity of life in
himself, he seeks forgetfulness, and finds it in the juice of these
herbs, but that his great desire is to lose his reason at once (a desire
possibly superfluous)."
"Then a youth of indescribable beauty rides in on
a black steed, and an immense multitude of all nations follow him."
"The youth represents death, for whom all the peoples are yearning."
"And
finally, in the last scene we are suddenly shown the Tower of Babel, and
certain athletes at last finish building it with a song of new hope, and
when at length they complete the topmost pinnacle, the lord (of Olympia,
let us say) takes flight in a comic fashion, and man, grasping the
situation and seizing his place, at once begins a new life with new
insight into things."
"Well, this poem was thought at that time to be
dangerous."
"Last year I proposed to Stepan Trofimovitch to publish it,
on the ground of its perfect harmlessness nowadays, but he declined
the suggestion with evident dissatisfaction."
"My view of its complete
harmlessness evidently displeased him, and I even ascribe to it a
certain coldness on his part, which lasted two whole months."
And what do you think?
"Suddenly, almost at the time I proposed printing
it here, our poem was published abroad in a collection of revolutionary
verse, without the knowledge of Stepan Trofimovitch."
"He was at
first alarmed, rushed to the governor, and wrote a noble letter in
self-defence to Petersburg."
"He read it to me twice, but did not send
it, not knowing to whom to address it."
"In fact he was in a state of
agitation for a whole month, but I am convinced that in the secret
recesses of his heart he was enormously flattered."
"He almost took the
copy of the collection to bed with him, and kept it hidden under his
mattress in the daytime; he positively would not allow the women to turn
his bed, and although he expected every day a telegram, he held his head
high."
No telegram came.
"Then he made friends with me again, which is a
proof of the extreme kindness of his gentle and unresentful heart."
"II

Of course I don't assert that he had never suffered for his convictions
at all, but I am fully convinced that he might have gone on lecturing
on his Arabs as long as he liked, if he had only given the necessary
explanations."
"But he was too lofty, and he proceeded with peculiar haste
to assure himself that his career was ruined forever ""by the vortex of
circumstance."""
"And if the whole truth is to be told the real cause of
the change in his career was the very delicate proposition which had
been made before and was then renewed by Varvara Petrovna Stavrogin, a
lady of great wealth, the wife of a lieutenant-general, that he should
undertake the education and the whole intellectual development of her
only son in the capacity of a superior sort of teacher and friend, to
say nothing of a magnificent salary."
"This proposal had been made to
him the first time in Berlin, at the moment when he was first left a
widower."
"His first wife was a frivolous girl from our province, whom he
married in his early and unthinking youth, and apparently he had had a
great deal of trouble with this young person, charming as she was,
owing to the lack of means for her support; and also from other, more
delicate, reasons."
"She died in Paris after three years' separation
from him, leaving him a son of five years old; ""the fruit of our first,
joyous, and unclouded love,"" were the words the sorrowing father once
let fall in my presence."
"The child had, from the first, been sent back to Russia, where he was
brought up in the charge of distant cousins in some remote region."
"Stepan Trofimovitch had declined Varvara Petrovna's proposal on that
occasion and had quickly married again, before the year was over, a
taciturn Berlin girl, and, what makes it more strange, there was no
particular necessity for him to do so."
"But apart from his marriage there
were, it appears, other reasons for his declining the situation."
"He was
tempted by the resounding fame of a professor, celebrated at that time,
and he, in his turn, hastened to the lecturer's chair for which he had
been preparing himself, to try his eagle wings in flight."
"But now with
singed wings he naturally remembered the proposition which even then had
made him hesitate."
"The sudden death of his second wife, who did not live
a year with him, settled the matter decisively."
"To put it plainly it was
all brought about by the passionate sympathy and priceless, so to
speak, classic friendship of Varvara Petrovna, if one may use such
an expression of friendship."
"He flung himself into the arms of this
friendship, and his position was settled for more than twenty years."
"I
use the expression ""flung himself into the arms of,"" but God forbid that
anyone should fly to idle and superfluous conclusions."
"These embraces
must be understood only in the most loftily moral sense."
"The most
refined and delicate tie united these two beings, both so remarkable,
forever."
"The post of tutor was the more readily accepted too, as the property--a
very small one--left to Stepan Trofimovitch by his first wife was close
to Skvoreshniki, the Stavrogins' magnificent estate on the outskirts of
our provincial town."
"Besides, in the stillness of his study, far from
the immense burden of university work, it was always possible to devote
himself to the service of science, and to enrich the literature of his
country with erudite studies."
These works did not appear.
"But on the
other hand it did appear possible to spend the rest of his life, more
than twenty years, ""a reproach incarnate,"" so to speak, to his native
country, in the words of a popular poet:

_Reproach incarnate thou didst stand_
_Erect before thy Fatherland,_
_O Liberal idealist!_

But the person to whom the popular poet referred may perhaps have had
the right to adopt that pose for the rest of his life if he had wished
to do so, though it must have been tedious."
"Our Stepan Trofimovitch was,
to tell the truth, only an imitator compared with such people; moreover,
he had grown weary of standing erect and often lay down for a while."
"But, to do him justice, the ""incarnation of reproach"" was preserved even
in the recumbent attitude, the more so as that was quite sufficient for
the province."
"You should have seen him at our club when he sat down to
cards."
"His whole figure seemed to exclaim ""Cards!"
"Me sit down to whist
with you!"
Is it consistent?
Who is responsible for it?
"Who has shattered
my energies and turned them to whist?"
"Ah, perish, Russia!"""
"and he would
majestically trump with a heart."
"And to tell the truth he dearly loved a game of cards, which led him,
especially in later years, into frequent and unpleasant skirmishes with
Varvara Petrovna, particularly as he was always losing."
"But of that
later."
"I will only observe that he was a man of tender conscience (that
is, sometimes) and so was often depressed."
"In the course of his twenty
years' friendship with Varvara Petrovna he used regularly, three or
four times a year, to sink into a state of ""patriotic grief,"" as it
was called among us, or rather really into an attack of spleen, but our
estimable Varvara Petrovna preferred the former phrase."
"Of late years
his grief had begun to be not only patriotic, but at times alcoholic
too; but Varvara Petrovna's alertness succeeded in keeping him all his
life from trivial inclinations."
"And he needed someone to look after him
indeed, for he sometimes behaved very oddly: in the midst of his exalted
sorrow he would begin laughing like any simple peasant."
"There were
moments when he began to take a humorous tone even about himself."
"But
there was nothing Varvara Petrovna dreaded so much as a humorous tone."
"She was a woman of the classic type, a female Mæcenas, invariably
guided only by the highest considerations."
"The influence of this exalted
lady over her poor friend for twenty years is a fact of the first
importance."
"I shall need to speak of her more particularly, which I now
proceed to do."
"III

There are strange friendships."
"The two friends are always ready to fly
at one another, and go on like that all their lives, and yet they cannot
separate."
"Parting, in fact, is utterly impossible."
"The one who has begun
the quarrel and separated will be the first to fall ill and even die,
perhaps, if the separation comes off."
"I know for a positive fact that
several times Stepan Trofimovitch has jumped up from the sofa and
beaten the wall with his fists after the most intimate and emotional
_tête-à-tête_ with Varvara Petrovna."
"This proceeding was by no means an empty symbol; indeed, on one
occasion, he broke some plaster off the wall."
"It may be asked how I come
to know such delicate details."
What if I were myself a witness of it?
"What if Stepan Trofimovitch himself has, on more than one occasion,
sobbed on my shoulder while he described to me in lurid colours all his
most secret feelings."
(And what was there he did not say at such times!)
"But what almost always happened after these tearful outbreaks was that
next day he was ready to crucify himself for his ingratitude."
"He would
send for me in a hurry or run over to see me simply to assure me that
Varvara Petrovna was ""an angel of honour and delicacy, while he was very
much the opposite."""
"He did not only run to confide in me, but, on more
than one occasion, described it all to her in the most eloquent letter,
and wrote a full signed confession that no longer ago than the day
before he had told an outsider that she kept him out of vanity, that
she was envious of his talents and erudition, that she hated him and was
only afraid to express her hatred openly, dreading that he would leave
her and so damage her literary reputation, that this drove him to
self-contempt, and he was resolved to die a violent death, and that he
was waiting for the final word from her which would decide everything,
and so on and so on in the same style."
"You can fancy after this what
an hysterical pitch the nervous outbreaks of this most innocent of
all fifty-year-old infants sometimes reached!"
"I once read one of these
letters after some quarrel between them, arising from a trivial matter,
but growing venomous as it went on."
"I was horrified and besought him not
to send it."
"""I must... more honourable... duty..."
"I shall die if I don't confess
everything, everything!"""
"he answered almost in delirium, and he did send
the letter."
"That was the difference between them, that Varvara Petrovna never would
have sent such a letter."
"It is true that he was passionately fond of
writing, he wrote to her though he lived in the same house, and during
hysterical interludes he would write two letters a day."
"I know for a
fact that she always read these letters with the greatest attention,
even when she received two a day, and after reading them she put them
away in a special drawer, sorted and annotated; moreover, she pondered
them in her heart."
"But she kept her friend all day without an answer,
met him as though there were nothing the matter, exactly as though
nothing special had happened the day before."
"By degrees she broke him in
so completely that at last he did not himself dare to allude to what had
happened the day before, and only glanced into her eyes at times."
"But
she never forgot anything, while he sometimes forgot too quickly, and
encouraged by her composure he would not infrequently, if friends came
in, laugh and make jokes over the champagne the very same day."
"With what
malignancy she must have looked at him at such moments, while he noticed
nothing!"
"Perhaps in a week's time, a month's time, or even six months
later, chancing to recall some phrase in such a letter, and then the
whole letter with all its attendant circumstances, he would suddenly
grow hot with shame, and be so upset that he fell ill with one of his
attacks of ""summer cholera."""
"These attacks of a sort of ""summer cholera""
were, in some cases, the regular consequence of his nervous agitations
and were an interesting peculiarity of his physical constitution."
No doubt Varvara Petrovna did very often hate him.
"But there was one
thing he had not discerned up to the end: that was that he had become
for her a son, her creation, even, one may say, her invention; he had
become flesh of her flesh, and she kept and supported him not simply
from ""envy of his talents."""
"And how wounded she must have been by such
suppositions!"
"An inexhaustible love for him lay concealed in her heart
in the midst of continual hatred, jealousy, and contempt."
"She would not
let a speck of dust fall upon him, coddled him up for twenty-two years,
would not have slept for nights together if there were the faintest
breath against his reputation as a poet, a learned man, and a public
character."
"She had invented him, and had been the first to believe in
her own invention."
"He was, after a fashion, her day-dream...."
"But in
return she exacted a great deal from him, sometimes even slavishness."
"It
was incredible how long she harboured resentment."
"I have two anecdotes
to tell about that."
"IV

On one occasion, just at the time when the first rumours of the
emancipation of the serfs were in the air, when all Russia was exulting
and making ready for a complete regeneration, Varvara Petrovna was
visited by a baron from Petersburg, a man of the highest connections,
and very closely associated with the new reform."
"Varvara Petrovna prized
such visits highly, as her connections in higher circles had grown
weaker and weaker since the death of her husband, and had at last ceased
altogether."
The baron spent an hour drinking tea with her.
"There was no
one else present but Stepan Trofimovitch, whom Varvara Petrovna invited
and exhibited."
"The baron had heard something about him before or
affected to have done so, but paid little attention to him at tea."
"Stepan Trofimovitch of course was incapable of making a social blunder,
and his manners were most elegant."
"Though I believe he was by no means
of exalted origin, yet it happened that he had from earliest childhood
been brought up in a Moscow household--of high rank, and consequently
was well bred."
He spoke French like a Parisian.
"Thus the baron was to
have seen from the first glance the sort of people with whom Varvara
Petrovna surrounded herself, even in provincial seclusion."
"But things
did not fall out like this."
"When the baron positively asserted the
absolute truth of the rumours of the great reform, which were then
only just beginning to be heard, Stepan Trofimovitch could not contain
himself, and suddenly shouted ""Hurrah!"""
"and even made some gesticulation
indicative of delight."
"His ejaculation was not over-loud and quite
polite, his delight was even perhaps premeditated, and his gesture
purposely studied before the looking-glass half an hour before tea."
"But
something must have been amiss with it, for the baron permitted himself
a faint smile, though he, at once, with extraordinary courtesy, put in
a phrase concerning the universal and befitting emotion of all Russian
hearts in view of the great event."
"Shortly afterwards he took his
leave and at parting did not forget to hold out two fingers to Stepan
Trofimovitch."
"On returning to the drawing-room Varvara Petrovna was
at first silent for two or three minutes, and seemed to be looking for
something on the table."
"Then she turned to Stepan Trofimovitch, and with
pale face and flashing eyes she hissed in a whisper:

""I shall never forgive you for that!"""
"Next day she met her friend as though nothing had happened, she never
referred to the incident, but thirteen years afterwards, at a tragic
moment, she recalled it and reproached him with it, and she turned pale,
just as she had done thirteen years before."
"Only twice in the course of
her life did she say to him:

""I shall never forgive you for that!"""
"The incident with the baron was the second time, but the first incident
was so characteristic and had so much influence on the fate of Stepan
Trofimovitch that I venture to refer to that too."
"It was in 1855, in spring-time, in May, just after the news had reached
Skvoreshniki of the death of Lieutenant-General Stavrogin, a frivolous
old gentleman who died of a stomach ailment on the way to the Crimea,
where he was hastening to join the army on active service."
"Varvara
Petrovna was left a widow and put on deep mourning."
"She could not, it is
true, deplore his death very deeply, since, for the last four years,
she had been completely separated from him owing to incompatibility of
temper, and was giving him an allowance."
"(The Lieutenant-General himself
had nothing but one hundred and fifty serfs and his pay, besides his
position and his connections."
"All the money and Skvoreshniki belonged to
Varvara Petrovna, the only daughter of a very rich contractor.)"
"Yet she
was shocked by the suddenness of the news, and retired into complete
solitude."
"Stepan Trofimovitch, of course, was always at her side."
May was in its full beauty.
The evenings were exquisite.
"The wild cherry
was in flower."
"The two friends walked every evening in the garden and
used to sit till nightfall in the arbour, and pour out their thoughts
and feelings to one another."
They had poetic moments.
"Under the
influence of the change in her position Varvara Petrovna talked more
than usual."
"She, as it were, clung to the heart of her friend, and this
continued for several evenings."
"A strange idea suddenly came over Stepan
Trofimovitch: ""Was not the inconsolable widow reckoning upon him, and
expecting from him, when her mourning was over, the offer of his hand?"""
"A cynical idea, but the very loftiness of a man's nature sometimes
increases a disposition to cynical ideas if only from the many-sidedness
of his culture."
"He began to look more deeply into it, and thought it
seemed like it."
"He pondered: ""Her fortune is immense, of course, but...""
Varvara Petrovna certainly could not be called a beauty."
"She was a
tall, yellow, bony woman with an extremely long face, suggestive of a
horse."
"Stepan Trofimovitch hesitated more and more, he was tortured by
doubts, he positively shed tears of indecision once or twice (he wept
not infrequently)."
"In the evenings, that is to say in the arbour, his
countenance involuntarily began to express something capricious and
ironical, something coquettish and at the same time condescending."
"This
is apt to happen as it were by accident, and the more gentlemanly the
man the more noticeable it is."
"Goodness only knows what one is to think
about it, but it's most likely that nothing had begun working in her
heart that could have fully justified Stepan Trofimovitch's suspicions."
"Moreover, she would not have changed her name, Stavrogin, for his
name, famous as it was."
"Perhaps there was nothing in it but the play
of femininity on her side; the manifestation of an unconscious feminine
yearning so natural in some extremely feminine types."
"However, I won't
answer for it; the depths of the female heart have not been explored to
this day."
But I must continue.
"It is to be supposed that she soon inwardly guessed the significance of
her friend's strange expression; she was quick and observant, and he was
sometimes extremely guileless."
"But the evenings went on as before, and
their conversations were just as poetic and interesting."
"And behold
on one occasion at nightfall, after the most lively and poetical
conversation, they parted affectionately, warmly pressing each other's
hands at the steps of the lodge where Stepan Trofimovitch slept."
"Every
summer he used to move into this little lodge which stood adjoining the
huge seignorial house of Skvoreshniki, almost in the garden."
"He had only
just gone in, and in restless hesitation taken a cigar, and not having
yet lighted it, was standing weary and motionless before the open
window, gazing at the light feathery white clouds gliding around the
bright moon, when suddenly a faint rustle made him start and turn
round."
"Varvara Petrovna, whom he had left only four minutes earlier,
was standing before him again."
Her yellow face was almost blue.
"Her lips
were pressed tightly together and twitching at the corners."
"For ten full
seconds she looked him in the eyes in silence with a firm relentless
gaze, and suddenly whispered rapidly:

""I shall never forgive you for this!"""
"When, ten years later, Stepan Trofimovitch, after closing the doors,
told me this melancholy tale in a whisper, he vowed that he had been so
petrified on the spot that he had not seen or heard how Varvara Petrovna
had disappeared."
"As she never once afterwards alluded to the incident
and everything went on as though nothing had happened, he was all his
life inclined to the idea that it was all an hallucination, a symptom
of illness, the more so as he was actually taken ill that very night
and was indisposed for a fortnight, which, by the way, cut short the
interviews in the arbour."
"But in spite of his vague theory of hallucination he seemed every day,
all his life, to be expecting the continuation, and, so to say, the
_dénouement_ of this affair."
"He could not believe that that was the end of
it!"
And if so he must have looked strangely sometimes at his friend.
"V

She had herself designed the costume for him which he wore for the rest
of his life."
"It was elegant and characteristic; a long black frock-coat,
buttoned almost to the top, but stylishly cut; a soft hat (in summer a
straw hat) with a wide brim, a white batiste cravat with a full bow
and hanging ends, a cane with a silver knob; his hair flowed on to his
shoulders."
"It was dark brown, and only lately had begun to get a little
grey."
He was clean-shaven.
"He was said to have been very handsome in his
youth."
"And, to my mind, he was still an exceptionally impressive figure
even in old age."
"Besides, who can talk of old age at fifty-three?"
"From his special pose as a patriot, however, he did not try to appear
younger, but seemed rather to pride himself on the solidity of his
age, and, dressed as described, tall and thin with flowing hair, he
looked almost like a patriarch, or even more like the portrait of the
poet Kukolnik, engraved in the edition of his works published in 1830 or
thereabouts."
"This resemblance was especially striking when he sat in the
garden in summertime, on a seat under a bush of flowering lilac, with
both hands propped on his cane and an open book beside him, musing
poetically over the setting sun."
"In regard to books I may remark that
he came in later years rather to avoid reading."
"But that was only quite
towards the end."
"The papers and magazines ordered in great profusion by
Varvara Petrovna he was continually reading."
"He never lost interest in
the successes of Russian literature either, though he always maintained
a dignified attitude with regard to them."
"He was at one time engrossed
in the study of our home and foreign politics, but he soon gave up the
undertaking with a gesture of despair."
"It sometimes happened that he
would take De Tocqueville with him into the garden while he had a Paul
de Kock in his pocket."
But these are trivial matters.
"I must observe in parenthesis about the portrait of Kukolnik; the
engraving had first come into the hands of Varvara Petrovna when she was
a girl in a high-class boarding-school in Moscow."
"She fell in love with
the portrait at once, after the habit of all girls at school who fall
in love with anything they come across, as well as with their teachers,
especially the drawing and writing masters."
"What is interesting in this,
though, is not the characteristics of girls but the fact that even at
fifty Varvara Petrovna kept the engraving among her most intimate and
treasured possessions, so that perhaps it was only on this account that
she had designed for Stepan Trofimovitch a costume somewhat like the
poet's in the engraving."
"But that, of course, is a trifling matter too."
"For the first years or, more accurately, for the first half of the time
he spent with Varvara Petrovna, Stepan Trofimovitch was still planning a
book and every day seriously prepared to write it."
"But during the later
period he must have forgotten even what he had done."
"More and more
frequently he used to say to us:

""I seem to be ready for work, my materials are collected, yet the work
doesn't get done!"
"Nothing is done!"""
And he would bow his head dejectedly.
"No doubt this was calculated
to increase his prestige in our eyes as a martyr to science, but he
himself was longing for something else."
"""They have forgotten me!"
"I'm
no use to anyone!"""
broke from him more than once.
"This intensified
depression took special hold of him towards the end of the fifties."
Varvara Petrovna realised at last that it was a serious matter.
"Besides,
she could not endure the idea that her friend was forgotten and useless."
"To distract him and at the same time to renew his fame she carried him
off to Moscow, where she had fashionable acquaintances in the
literary and scientific world; but it appeared that Moscow too was
unsatisfactory."
"It was a peculiar time; something new was beginning, quite unlike the
stagnation of the past, something very strange too, though it was felt
everywhere, even at Skvoreshniki."
Rumours of all sorts reached us.
"The
facts were generally more or less well known, but it was evident that
in addition to the facts there were certain ideas accompanying them,
and what's more, a great number of them."
And this was perplexing.
"It was
impossible to estimate and find out exactly what was the drift of these
ideas."
"Varvara Petrovna was prompted by the feminine composition of her
character to a compelling desire to penetrate the secret of them."
"She took to reading newspapers and magazines, prohibited publications
printed abroad and even the revolutionary manifestoes which were just
beginning to appear at the time (she was able to procure them all); but
this only set her head in a whirl."
"She fell to writing letters; she got
few answers, and they grew more incomprehensible as time went on."
"Stepan
Trofimovitch was solemnly called upon to explain ""these ideas"" to
her once for all, but she remained distinctly dissatisfied with his
explanations."
"Stepan Trofimovitch's view of the general movement was supercilious in
the extreme."
"In his eyes all it amounted to was that he was forgotten
and of no use."
"At last his name was mentioned, at first in periodicals
published abroad as that of an exiled martyr, and immediately afterwards
in Petersburg as that of a former star in a celebrated constellation."
He was even for some reason compared with Radishtchev.
"Then someone
printed the statement that he was dead and promised an obituary notice
of him."
"Stepan Trofimovitch instantly perked up and assumed an air of
immense dignity."
"All his disdain for his contemporaries evaporated and
he began to cherish the dream of joining the movement and showing his
powers."
"Varvara Petrovna's faith in everything instantly revived and she
was thrown into a violent ferment."
"It was decided to go to Petersburg
without a moment's delay, to find out everything on the spot, to go into
everything personally, and, if possible, to throw themselves heart and
soul into the new movement."
"Among other things she announced that she
was prepared to found a magazine of her own, and henceforward to devote
her whole life to it."
"Seeing what it had come to, Stepan Trofimovitch
became more condescending than ever, and on the journey began to behave
almost patronisingly to Varvara Petrovna--which she at once laid up in
her heart against him."
"She had, however, another very important reason
for the trip, which was to renew her connections in higher spheres."
"It was necessary, as far as she could, to remind the world of her
existence, or at any rate to make an attempt to do so."
"The ostensible
object of the journey was to see her only son, who was just finishing
his studies at a Petersburg lyceum."
"VI

They spent almost the whole winter season in Petersburg."
"But by Lent
everything burst like a rainbow-coloured soap-bubble."
"Their dreams were dissipated, and the muddle, far from being cleared
up, had become even more revoltingly incomprehensible."
"To begin with,
connections with the higher spheres were not established, or only on a
microscopic scale, and by humiliating exertions."
"In her mortification
Varvara Petrovna threw herself heart and soul into the ""new ideas,"" and
began giving evening receptions."
"She invited literary people, and they
were brought to her at once in multitudes."
"Afterwards they came of
themselves without invitation, one brought another."
"Never had she seen
such literary men."
"They were incredibly vain, but quite open in their
vanity, as though they were performing a duty by the display of it."
"Some (but by no means all) of them even turned up intoxicated, seeming,
however, to detect in this a peculiar, only recently discovered, merit."
They were all strangely proud of something.
"On every face was written
that they had only just discovered some extremely important secret."
"They
abused one another, and took credit to themselves for it."
"It was rather
difficult to find out what they had written exactly, but among them
there were critics, novelists, dramatists, satirists, and exposers of
abuses."
"Stepan Trofimovitch penetrated into their very highest circle
from which the movement was directed."
"Incredible heights had to be
scaled to reach this group; but they gave him a cordial welcome, though,
of course, no one of them had ever heard of him or knew anything about
him except that he ""represented an idea."""
"His manoeuvres among them
were so successful that he got them twice to Varvara Petrovna's salon
in spite of their Olympian grandeur."
"These people were very serious and
very polite; they behaved nicely; the others were evidently afraid of
them; but it was obvious that they had no time to spare."
"Two or three
former literary celebrities who happened to be in Petersburg, and with
whom Varvara Petrovna had long maintained a most refined correspondence,
came also."
"But to her surprise these genuine and quite indubitable
celebrities were stiller than water, humbler than the grass, and some
of them simply hung on to this new rabble, and were shamefully cringing
before them."
At first Stepan Trofimovitch was a success.
"People caught
at him and began to exhibit him at public literary gatherings."
"The first
time he came on to the platform at some public reading in which he was
to take part, he was received with enthusiastic clapping which lasted
for five minutes."
"He recalled this with tears nine years afterwards,
though rather from his natural artistic sensibility than from gratitude."
"""I swear, and I'm ready to bet,"" he declared (but only to me, and in
secret), ""that not one of that audience knew anything whatever about
me."""
A noteworthy admission.
"He must have had a keen intelligence since
he was capable of grasping his position so clearly even on the platform,
even in such a state of exaltation; it also follows that he had not
a keen intelligence if, nine years afterwards, he could not recall
it without mortification."
"He was made to sign two or three collective
protests (against what he did not know); he signed them."
"Varvara
Petrovna too was made to protest against some ""disgraceful action"" and
she signed too."
"The majority of these new people, however, though they
visited Varvara Petrovna, felt themselves for some reason called upon
to regard her with contempt, and with undisguised irony."
"Stepan
Trofimovitch hinted to me at bitter moments afterwards that it was from
that time she had been envious of him."
"She saw, of course, that she
could not get on with these people, yet she received them eagerly,
with all the hysterical impatience of her sex, and, what is more, she
expected something."
"At her parties she talked little, although she could
talk, but she listened the more."
"They talked of the abolition of the
censorship, and of phonetic spelling, of the substitution of the Latin
characters for the Russian alphabet, of someone's having been sent into
exile the day before, of some scandal, of the advantage of splitting
Russia into nationalities united in a free federation, of the abolition
of the army and the navy, of the restoration of Poland as far as
the Dnieper, of the peasant reforms, and of the manifestoes, of the
abolition of the hereditary principle, of the family, of children, and
of priests, of women's rights, of Kraevsky's house, for which no one
ever seemed able to forgive Mr. Kraevsky, and so on, and so on."
"It was
evident that in this mob of new people there were many impostors, but
undoubtedly there were also many honest and very attractive people, in
spite of some surprising characteristics in them."
"The honest ones were
far more difficult to understand than the coarse and dishonest, but it
was impossible to tell which was being made a tool of by the other."
"When Varvara Petrovna announced her idea of founding a magazine, people
flocked to her in even larger numbers, but charges of being a capitalist
and an exploiter of labour were showered upon her to her face."
"The
rudeness of these accusations was only equalled by their unexpectedness."
"The aged General Ivan Ivanovitch Drozdov, an old friend and comrade
of the late General Stavrogin's, known to us all here as an extremely
stubborn and irritable, though very estimable, man (in his own way, of
course), who ate a great deal, and was dreadfully afraid of atheism,
quarrelled at one of Varvara Petrovna's parties with a distinguished
young man."
"The latter at the first word exclaimed, ""You must be a
general if you talk like that,"" meaning that he could find no word of
abuse worse than ""general."""
"Ivan Ivanovitch flew into a terrible passion: ""Yes, sir, I am a general,
and a lieutenant-general, and I have served my Tsar, and you, sir, are a
puppy and an infidel!"""
An outrageous scene followed.
"Next day the incident was exposed in
print, and they began getting up a collective protest against Varvara
Petrovna's disgraceful conduct in not having immediately turned
the general out."
"In an illustrated paper there appeared a malignant
caricature in which Varvara Petrovna, Stepan Trofimovitch, and General
Drozdov were depicted as three reactionary friends."
"There were verses
attached to this caricature written by a popular poet especially for the
occasion."
"I may observe, for my own part, that many persons of general's
rank certainly have an absurd habit of saying, ""I have served my
Tsar""...just as though they had not the same Tsar as all the rest of us,
their simple fellow-subjects, but had a special Tsar of their own."
"It was impossible, of course, to remain any longer in Petersburg, all
the more so as Stepan Trofimovitch was overtaken by a complete fiasco."
"He could not resist talking of the claims of art, and they laughed
at him more loudly as time went on."
"At his last lecture he thought to
impress them with patriotic eloquence, hoping to touch their hearts,
and reckoning on the respect inspired by his ""persecution."""
"He did
not attempt to dispute the uselessness and absurdity of the word
""fatherland,"" acknowledged the pernicious influence of religion, but
firmly and loudly declared that boots were of less consequence than
Pushkin; of much less, indeed."
"He was hissed so mercilessly that he
burst into tears, there and then, on the platform."
"Varvara Petrovna took
him home more dead than alive."
"_""On m'a traité comme un vieux bonnet
de coton,""_ he babbled senselessly."
"She was looking after him all night,
giving him laurel-drops and repeating to him till daybreak, ""You will
still be of use; you will still make your mark; you will be appreciated
... in another place."""
"Early next morning five literary men called on Varvara Petrovna, three
of them complete strangers, whom she had never set eyes on before."
"With
a stern air they informed her that they had looked into the question of
her magazine, and had brought her their decision on the subject."
"Varvara
Petrovna had never authorised anyone to look into or decide anything
concerning her magazine."
"Their decision was that, having founded the
magazine, she should at once hand it over to them with the capital to
run it, on the basis of a co-operative society."
"She herself was to
go back to Skvoreshniki, not forgetting to take with her Stepan
Trofimovitch, who was ""out of date."""
"From delicacy they agreed to
recognise the right of property in her case, and to send her every year
a sixth part of the net profits."
"What was most touching about it
was that of these five men, four certainly were not actuated by any
mercenary motive, and were simply acting in the interests of the
""cause."""
"""We came away utterly at a loss,"" Stepan Trofimovitch used to say
afterwards."
"""I couldn't make head or tail of it, and kept muttering, I
remember, to the rumble of the train:

     'Vyek, and vyek, and Lyov Kambek,
     Lyov Kambek and vyek, and vyek.'"
"and goodness knows what, all the way to Moscow."
"It was only in Moscow
that I came to myself--as though we really might find something
different there."""
"""Oh, my friends!"""
"he would exclaim to us sometimes with fervour, ""you
cannot imagine what wrath and sadness overcome your whole soul when a
great idea, which you have long cherished as holy, is caught up by the
ignorant and dragged forth before fools like themselves into the street,
and you suddenly meet it in the market unrecognisable, in the mud,
absurdly set up, without proportion, without harmony, the plaything of
foolish louts!"
No!
"In our day it was not so, and it was not this for
which we strove."
"No, no, not this at all."
"I don't recognise it.... Our
day will come again and will turn all the tottering fabric of to-day
into a true path."
"If not, what will happen?..."""
"VII

Immediately on their return from Petersburg Varvara Petrovna sent her
friend abroad to ""recruit""; and, indeed, it was necessary for them to
part for a time, she felt that."
Stepan Trofimovitch was delighted to go.
"""There I shall revive!"""
he exclaimed.
"""There, at last, I shall set to
work!"""
"But in the first of his letters from Berlin he struck his usual
note:

""My heart is broken!"""
he wrote to Varvara Petrovna.
"""I can forget
nothing!"
"Here, in Berlin, everything brings back to me my old past, my
first raptures and my first agonies."
Where is she?
Where are they both?
Where are you two angels of whom I was never worthy?
"Where is my son, my
beloved son?"
"And last of all, where am I, where is my old self, strong
as steel, firm as a rock, when now some Andreev, our orthodox clown with
a beard, _peut briser mon existence en deux_""--and so on."
"As for Stepan Trofimovitch's son, he had only seen him twice in his
life, the first time when he was born and the second time lately in
Petersburg, where the young man was preparing to enter the university."
"The boy had been all his life, as we have said already, brought up by
his aunts (at Varvara Petrovna's expense) in a remote province, nearly
six hundred miles from Skvoreshniki."
"As for Andreev, he was nothing
more or less than our local shopkeeper, a very eccentric fellow, a
self-taught archæologist who had a passion for collecting Russian
antiquities and sometimes tried to outshine Stepan Trofimovitch in
erudition and in the progressiveness of his opinions."
"This worthy
shopkeeper, with a grey beard and silver-rimmed spectacles, still owed
Stepan Trofimovitch four hundred roubles for some acres of timber he had
bought on the latter's little estate (near Skvoreshniki)."
"Though Varvara
Petrovna had liberally provided her friend with funds when she sent him
to Berlin, yet Stepan Trofimovitch had, before starting, particularly
reckoned on getting that four hundred roubles, probably for his secret
expenditure, and was ready to cry when Andreev asked leave to defer
payment for a month, which he had a right to do, since he had brought
the first installments of the money almost six months in advance to meet
Stepan Trofimovitch's special need at the time."
"Varvara Petrovna read this first letter greedily, and underlining in
pencil the exclamation: ""Where are they both?"""
"numbered it and put it
away in a drawer."
"He had, of course, referred to his two deceased wives."
"The second letter she received from Berlin was in a different strain:

""I am working twelve hours out of the twenty-four."""
"(""Eleven would be
enough,"" muttered Varvara Petrovna.)"
"""I'm rummaging in the libraries,
collating, copying, rushing about."
I've visited the professors.
"I have
renewed my acquaintance with the delightful Dundasov family."
"What a
charming creature Lizaveta Nikolaevna is even now!"
"She sends you her
greetings."
Her young husband and three nephews are all in Berlin.
"I
sit up talking till daybreak with the young people and we have almost
Athenian evenings, Athenian, I mean, only in their intellectual subtlety
and refinement."
"Everything is in noble style; a great deal of music,
Spanish airs, dreams of the regeneration of all humanity, ideas
of eternal beauty, of the Sistine Madonna, light interspersed with
darkness, but there are spots even on the sun!"
"Oh, my friend, my noble,
faithful friend!"
"In heart I am with you and am yours; with you alone,
always, _en tout pays_, even in _le pays de Makar et de ses veaux_, of
which we often used to talk in agitation in Petersburg, do you remember,
before we came away."
I think of it with a smile.
"Crossing the frontier I
felt myself in safety, a sensation, strange and new, for the first time
after so many years""--and so on and so on."
"""Come, it's all nonsense!"""
"Varvara Petrovna commented, folding up that
letter too."
"""If he's up till daybreak with his Athenian nights, he isn't
at his books for twelve hours a day."
Was he drunk when he wrote it?
That Dundasov woman dares to send me greetings!
"But there, let him amuse
himself!"""
"The phrase ""_dans le pays de Makar et de ses veaux_"" meant: ""wherever
Makar may drive his calves."""
"Stepan Trofimovitch sometimes purposely
translated Russian proverbs and traditional sayings into French in the
most stupid way, though no doubt he was able to understand and translate
them better."
"But he did it from a feeling that it was chic, and thought
it witty."
But he did not amuse himself for long.
"He could not hold out for four
months, and was soon flying back to Skvoreshniki."
"His last letters
consisted of nothing but outpourings of the most sentimental love for
his absent friend, and were literally wet with tears."
"There are natures
extremely attached to home like lap-dogs."
"The meeting of the friends was
enthusiastic."
"Within two days everything was as before and even duller
than before."
"""My friend,"" Stepan Trofimovitch said to me a fortnight
after, in dead secret, ""I have discovered something awful for me...
something new: _je suis un simple_ dependent, _et rien de plus!"
"Mais
r-r-rien de plus._""


VIII

After this we had a period of stagnation which lasted nine years."
"The hysterical outbreaks and sobbings on my shoulder that recurred at
regular intervals did not in the least mar our prosperity."
"I wonder that
Stepan Trofimovitch did not grow stout during this period."
"His nose was
a little redder, and his manner had gained in urbanity, that was all."
"By
degrees a circle of friends had formed around him, although it was never
a very large one."
"Though Varvara Petrovna had little to do with the
circle, yet we all recognised her as our patroness."
"After the lesson she
had received in Petersburg, she settled down in our town for good."
"In
winter she lived in her town house and spent the summer on her estate
in the neighbourhood."
"She had never enjoyed so much consequence and
prestige in our provincial society as during the last seven years of
this period, that is up to the time of the appointment of our present
governor."
"Our former governor, the mild Ivan Ossipovitch, who will never
be forgotten among us, was a near relation of Varvara Petrovna's, and
had at one time been under obligations to her."
"His wife trembled at the
very thought of displeasing her, while the homage paid her by provincial
society was carried almost to a pitch that suggested idolatry."
"So Stepan
Trofimovitch, too, had a good time."
"He was a member of the club, lost at
cards majestically, and was everywhere treated with respect, though
many people regarded him only as a ""learned man."""
"Later on, when Varvara
Petrovna allowed him to live in a separate house, we enjoyed greater
freedom than before."
Twice a week we used to meet at his house.
"We were
a merry party, especially when he was not sparing of the champagne."
"The
wine came from the shop of the same Andreev."
"The bill was paid twice
a year by Varvara Petrovna, and on the day it was paid Stepan
Trofimovitch almost invariably suffered from an attack of his ""summer
cholera."""
"One of the first members of our circle was Liputin, an elderly
provincial official, and a great liberal, who was reputed in the town
to be an atheist."
"He had married for the second time a young and pretty
wife with a dowry, and had, besides, three grown-up daughters."
"He
brought up his family in the fear of God, and kept a tight hand over
them."
"He was extremely stingy, and out of his salary had bought himself
a house and amassed a fortune."
"He was an uncomfortable sort of man, and
had not been in the service."
"He was not much respected in the town, and
was not received in the best circles."
"Moreover, he was a scandal-monger,
and had more than once had to smart for his back-biting, for which he
had been badly punished by an officer, and again by a country gentleman,
the respectable head of a family."
"But we liked his wit, his inquiring
mind, his peculiar, malicious liveliness."
"Varvara Petrovna disliked him,
but he always knew how to make up to her."
"Nor did she care for Shatov, who became one of our circle during the
last years of this period."
"Shatov had been a student and had been
expelled from the university after some disturbance."
"In his childhood he
had been a student of Stepan Trofimovitch's and was by birth a serf of
Varvara Petrovna's, the son of a former valet of hers, Pavel Fyodoritch,
and was greatly indebted to her bounty."
"She disliked him for his pride
and ingratitude and could never forgive him for not having come straight
to her on his expulsion from the university."
"On the contrary he had not
even answered the letter she had expressly sent him at the time, and
preferred to be a drudge in the family of a merchant of the new style,
with whom he went abroad, looking after his children more in the
position of a nurse than of a tutor."
"He was very eager to travel at the
time."
"The children had a governess too, a lively young Russian lady, who
also became one of the household on the eve of their departure, and
had been engaged chiefly because she was so cheap."
"Two months later the
merchant turned her out of the house for ""free thinking."""
"Shatov took
himself off after her and soon afterwards married her in Geneva."
"They lived together about three weeks, and then parted as free people
recognising no bonds, though, no doubt, also through poverty."
"He
wandered about Europe alone for a long time afterwards, living God knows
how; he is said to have blacked boots in the street, and to have been a
porter in some dockyard."
"At last, a year before, he had returned to his
native place among us and settled with an old aunt, whom he buried a
month later."
"His sister Dasha, who had also been brought up by Varvara
Petrovna, was a favourite of hers, and treated with respect and
consideration in her house."
"He saw his sister rarely and was not on
intimate terms with her."
"In our circle he was always sullen, and never
talkative; but from time to time, when his convictions were touched
upon, he became morbidly irritable and very unrestrained in his
language."
"""One has to tie Shatov up and then argue with him,"" Stepan Trofimovitch
would sometimes say in joke, but he liked him."
"Shatov had radically changed some of his former socialistic convictions
abroad and had rushed to the opposite extreme."
"He was one of those
idealistic beings common in Russia, who are suddenly struck by some
overmastering idea which seems, as it were, to crush them at once, and
sometimes forever."
"They are never equal to coping with it, but put
passionate faith in it, and their whole life passes afterwards, as it
were, in the last agonies under the weight of the stone that has fallen
upon them and half crushed them."
"In appearance Shatov was in complete
harmony with his convictions: he was short, awkward, had a shock of
flaxen hair, broad shoulders, thick lips, very thick overhanging white
eyebrows, a wrinkled forehead, and a hostile, obstinately downcast, as
it were shamefaced, expression in his eyes."
"His hair was always in a
wild tangle and stood up in a shock which nothing could smooth."
"He was
seven- or eight-and-twenty."
"""I no longer wonder that his wife ran away from him,"" Varvara Petrovna
enunciated on one occasion after gazing intently at him."
"He tried to be
neat in his dress, in spite of his extreme poverty."
"He refrained again
from appealing to Varvara Petrovna, and struggled along as best he
could, doing various jobs for tradespeople."
"At one time he served in a
shop, at another he was on the point of going as an assistant clerk on a
freight steamer, but he fell ill just at the time of sailing."
"It is
hard to imagine what poverty he was capable of enduring without thinking
about it at all."
"After his illness Varvara Petrovna sent him a hundred
roubles, anonymously and in secret."
"He found out the secret, however,
and after some reflection took the money and went to Varvara Petrovna to
thank her."
"She received him with warmth, but on this occasion, too,
he shamefully disappointed her."
"He only stayed five minutes, staring
blankly at the ground and smiling stupidly in profound silence, and
suddenly, at the most interesting point, without listening to what
she was saying, he got up, made an uncouth sideways bow, helpless
with confusion, caught against the lady's expensive inlaid work-table,
upsetting it on the floor and smashing it to atoms, and walked out
nearly dead with shame."
"Liputin blamed him severely afterwards for
having accepted the hundred roubles and having even gone to thank
Varvara Petrovna for them, instead of having returned the money with
contempt, because it had come from his former despotic mistress."
"He
lived in solitude on the outskirts of the town, and did not like any
of us to go and see him."
"He used to turn up invariably at Stepan
Trofimovitch's evenings, and borrowed newspapers and books from him."
"There was another young man who always came, one Virginsky, a clerk in
the service here, who had something in common with Shatov, though on
the surface he seemed his complete opposite in every respect."
"He was a
""family man"" too."
"He was a pathetic and very quiet young man though
he was thirty; he had considerable education though he was chiefly
self-taught."
"He was poor, married, and in the service, and supported the
aunt and sister of his wife."
"His wife and all the ladies of his family
professed the very latest convictions, but in rather a crude form."
"It was a case of ""an idea dragged forth into the street,"" as Stepan
Trofimovitch had expressed it upon a former occasion."
"They got it
all out of books, and at the first hint coming from any of our little
progressive corners in Petersburg they were prepared to throw anything
overboard, so soon as they were advised to do so."
"Madame Virginsky
practised as a midwife in the town."
"She had lived a long while
in Petersburg as a girl."
"Virginsky himself was a man of rare
single-heartedness, and I have seldom met more honest fervour."
"""I will never, never, abandon these bright hopes,"" he used to say to me
with shining eyes."
"Of these ""bright hopes"" he always spoke quietly, in
a blissful half-whisper, as it were secretly."
"He was rather tall, but
extremely thin and narrow-shouldered, and had extraordinarily lank hair
of a reddish hue."
"All Stepan Trofimovitch's condescending gibes at
some of his opinions he accepted mildly, answered him sometimes very
seriously, and often nonplussed him."
"Stepan Trofimovitch treated him
very kindly, and indeed he behaved like a father to all of us."
"""You are
all half-hearted chickens,"" he observed to Virginsky in joke."
"""All
who are like you, though in you, Virginsky, I have not observed that
narrow-mindedness I found in Petersburg, _chez ces séminaristes_."
"But
you're a half-hatched chicken all the same."
"Shatov would give anything
to hatch out, but he's half-hatched too."""
"""And I?"""
Liputin inquired.
"""You're simply the golden mean which will get on anywhere in its own
way."""
Liputin was offended.
"The story was told of Virginsky, and it was unhappily only too true,
that before his wife had spent a year in lawful wedlock with him she
announced that he was superseded and that she preferred Lebyadkin."
"This
Lebyadkin, a stranger to the town, turned out afterwards to be a very
dubious character, and not a retired captain as he represented himself
to be."
"He could do nothing but twist his moustache, drink, and chatter
the most inept nonsense that can possibly be imagined."
"This fellow, who
was utterly lacking in delicacy, at once settled in his house, glad to
live at another man's expense, ate and slept there and came, in the end,
to treating the master of the house with condescension."
"It was asserted
that when Virginsky's wife had announced to him that he was superseded
he said to her:

""My dear, hitherto I have only loved you, but now I respect you,"" but I
doubt whether this renunciation, worthy of ancient Rome, was ever really
uttered."
On the contrary they say that he wept violently.
"A fortnight
after he was superseded, all of them, in a ""family party,"" went one day
for a picnic to a wood outside the town to drink tea with their friends."
Virginsky was in a feverishly lively mood and took part in the dances.
"But suddenly, without any preliminary quarrel, he seized the giant
Lebyadkin with both hands, by the hair, just as the latter was dancing
a can-can solo, pushed him down, and began dragging him along with
shrieks, shouts, and tears."
"The giant was so panic-stricken that he did
not attempt to defend himself, and hardly uttered a sound all the time
he was being dragged along."
"But afterwards he resented it with all the
heat of an honourable man."
"Virginsky spent a whole night on his knees
begging his wife's forgiveness."
"But this forgiveness was not granted, as
he refused to apologise to Lebyadkin; moreover, he was upbraided for the
meanness of his ideas and his foolishness, the latter charge based on
the fact that he knelt down in the interview with his wife."
"The captain
soon disappeared and did not reappear in our town till quite lately,
when he came with his sister, and with entirely different aims; but
of him later."
"It was no wonder that the poor young husband sought our
society and found comfort in it."
"But he never spoke of his home-life to
us."
"On one occasion only, returning with me from Stepan Trofimovitch's,
he made a remote allusion to his position, but clutching my hand at once
he cried ardently:

""It's of no consequence."
It's only a personal incident.
"It's no
hindrance to the 'cause,' not the slightest!"""
"Stray guests visited our circle too; a Jew, called Lyamshin, and a
Captain Kartusov came."
"An old gentleman of inquiring mind used to come
at one time, but he died."
"Liputin brought an exiled Polish priest called
Slontsevsky, and for a time we received him on principle, but afterwards
we didn't keep it up."
"IX

At one time it was reported about the town that our little circle was a
hotbed of nihilism, profligacy, and godlessness, and the rumour gained
more and more strength."
"And yet we did nothing but indulge in the most
harmless, agreeable, typically Russian, light-hearted liberal chatter."
"""The higher liberalism"" and the ""higher liberal,"" that is, a liberal
without any definite aim, is only possible in Russia."
"Stepan Trofimovitch, like every witty man, needed a listener, and,
besides that, he needed the consciousness that he was fulfilling the
lofty duty of disseminating ideas."
"And finally he had to have someone
to drink champagne with, and over the wine to exchange light-hearted
views of a certain sort, about Russia and the ""Russian spirit,"" about
God in general, and the ""Russian God"" in particular, to repeat for the
hundredth time the same Russian scandalous stories that every one knew
and every one repeated."
"We had no distaste for the gossip of the town
which often, indeed, led us to the most severe and loftily moral
verdicts."
"We fell into generalising about humanity, made stern
reflections on the future of Europe and mankind in general,
authoritatively predicted that after Cæsarism France would at once sink
into the position of a second-rate power, and were firmly convinced that
this might terribly easily and quickly come to pass."
"We had long ago
predicted that the Pope would play the part of a simple archbishop in
a united Italy, and were firmly convinced that this thousand-year-old
question had, in our age of humanitarianism, industry, and railways,
become a trifling matter."
"But, of course, ""Russian higher liberalism""
could not look at the question in any other way."
"Stepan Trofimovitch
sometimes talked of art, and very well, though rather abstractly."
"He
sometimes spoke of the friends of his youth--all names noteworthy in
the history of Russian progress."
"He talked of them with emotion and
reverence, though sometimes with envy."
"If we were very much bored, the
Jew, Lyamshin (a little post-office clerk), a wonderful performer on
the piano, sat down to play, and in the intervals would imitate a pig,
a thunderstorm, a confinement with the first cry of the baby, and so on,
and so on; it was only for this that he was invited, indeed."
"If we had
drunk a great deal--and that did happen sometimes, though not often--we
flew into raptures, and even on one occasion sang the ""Marseillaise"" in
chorus to the accompaniment of Lyamshin, though I don't know how it
went off."
"The great day, the nineteenth of February, we welcomed
enthusiastically, and for a long time beforehand drank toasts in its
honour."
"But that was long ago, before the advent of Shatov or Virginsky,
when Stepan Trofimovitch was still living in the same house with Varvara
Petrovna."
"For some time before the great day Stepan Trofimovitch
fell into the habit of muttering to himself well-known, though rather
far-fetched, lines which must have been written by some liberal
landowner of the past:

_""The peasant with his axe is coming,_
_Something terrible will happen."
"""_

Something of that sort, I don't remember the exact words."
"Varvara
Petrovna overheard him on one occasion, and crying, ""Nonsense,
nonsense!"""
she went out of the room in a rage.
"Liputin, who happened to
be present, observed malignantly to Stepan Trofimovitch:

""It'll be a pity if their former serfs really do some mischief to
_messieurs les_ landowners to celebrate the occasion,"" and he drew his
forefinger round his throat."
"""_Cher ami,_"" Stepan Trofimovitch observed, ""believe me that--this (he
repeated the gesture) will never be of any use to our landowners nor to
any of us in general."
"We shall never be capable of organising anything
even without our heads, though our heads hinder our understanding more
than anything."""
"I may observe that many people among us anticipated that something
extraordinary, such as Liputin predicted, would take place on the day
of the emancipation, and those who held this view were the so-called
""authorities"" on the peasantry and the government."
"I believe Stepan
Trofimovitch shared this idea, so much so that almost on the eve of the
great day he began asking Varvara Petrovna's leave to go abroad; in fact
he began to be uneasy."
"But the great day passed, and some time
passed after it, and the condescending smile reappeared on Stepan
Trofimovitch's lips."
"In our presence he delivered himself of some
noteworthy thoughts on the character of the Russian in general, and the
Russian peasant in particular."
"""Like hasty people we have been in too great a hurry with our peasants,""
he said in conclusion of a series of remarkable utterances."
"""We have
made them the fashion, and a whole section of writers have for several
years treated them as though they were newly discovered curiosities."
"We
have put laurel-wreaths on lousy heads."
"The Russian village has given us
only 'Kamarinsky' in a thousand years."
"A remarkable Russian poet who was
also something of a wit, seeing the great Rachel on the stage for the
first time cried in ecstasy, 'I wouldn't exchange Rachel for a peasant!'"
I am prepared to go further.
"I would give all the peasants in Russia
for one Rachel."
"It's high time to look things in the face more
soberly, and not to mix up our national rustic pitch with _bouquet de
l'Impératrice._""

Liputin agreed at once, but remarked that one had to perjure oneself and
praise the peasant all the same for the sake of being progressive, that
even ladies in good society shed tears reading ""Poor Anton,"" and that
some of them even wrote from Paris to their bailiffs that they were,
henceforward, to treat the peasants as humanely as possible."
"It happened, and as ill-luck would have it just after the rumours of the
Anton Petrov affair had reached us, that there was some disturbance
in our province too, only about ten miles from Skvoreshniki, so that a
detachment of soldiers was sent down in a hurry."
"This time Stepan Trofimovitch was so much upset that he even frightened
us."
"He cried out at the club that more troops were needed, that they
ought to be telegraphed for from another province; he rushed off to the
governor to protest that he had no hand in it, begged him not to allow
his name on account of old associations to be brought into it, and
offered to write about his protest to the proper quarter in Petersburg."
"Fortunately it all passed over quickly and ended in nothing, but I was
surprised at Stepan Trofimovitch at the time."
"Three years later, as every one knows, people were beginning to talk
of nationalism, and ""public opinion"" first came upon the scene."
"Stepan
Trofimovitch laughed a great deal."
"""My friends,"" he instructed us, ""if our nationalism has 'dawned' as
they keep repeating in the papers--it's still at school, at some German
'Peterschule,' sitting over a German book and repeating its everlasting
German lesson, and its German teacher will make it go down on its knees
when he thinks fit."
I think highly of the German teacher.
"But nothing
has happened and nothing of the kind has dawned and everything is going
on in the old way, that is, as ordained by God."
"To my thinking that
should be enough for Russia, _pour notre Sainte Russie_."
"Besides, all this
Slavism and nationalism is too old to be new."
"Nationalism, if you like,
has never existed among us except as a distraction for gentlemen's
clubs, and Moscow ones at that."
"I'm not talking of the days of Igor, of
course."
And besides it all comes of idleness.
"Everything in Russia comes
of idleness, everything good and fine even."
"It all springs from the
charming, cultured, whimsical idleness of our gentry!"
"I'm ready to
repeat it for thirty thousand years."
"We don't know how to live by our
own labour."
"And as for the fuss they're making now about the 'dawn'
of some sort of public opinion, has it so suddenly dropped from heaven
without any warning?"
"How is it they don't understand that before we
can have an opinion of our own we must have work, our own work, our own
initiative in things, our own experience."
"Nothing is to be gained for
nothing."
If we work we shall have an opinion of our own.
"But as we
never shall work, our opinions will be formed for us by those who have
hitherto done the work instead of us, that is, as always, Europe, the
everlasting Germans--our teachers for the last two centuries."
"Moreover,
Russia is too big a tangle for us to unravel alone without the Germans,
and without hard work."
"For the last twenty years I've been sounding the
alarm, and the summons to work."
"I've given up my life to that appeal,
and, in my folly I put faith in it."
"Now I have lost faith in it, but I
sound the alarm still, and shall sound it to the tomb."
"I will pull at
the bell-ropes until they toll for my own requiem!"""
"""Alas!"
We could do nothing but assent.
"We applauded our teacher and with
what warmth, indeed!"
"And, after all, my friends, don't we still hear
to-day, every hour, at every step, the same ""charming,"" ""clever,""
""liberal,"" old Russian nonsense?"
Our teacher believed in God.
"""I can't understand why they make me out an infidel here,"" he used to
say sometimes."
"""I believe in God, _mais distinguons_, I believe in Him as
a Being who is conscious of Himself in me only."
"I cannot believe as my
Nastasya (the servant) or like some country gentleman who believes 'to
be on the safe side,' or like our dear Shatov--but no, Shatov doesn't
come into it."
"Shatov believes 'on principle,' like a Moscow Slavophil."
"As for Christianity, for all my genuine respect for it, I'm not a
Christian."
"I am more of an antique pagan, like the great Goethe, or
like an ancient Greek."
"The very fact that Christianity has failed to
understand woman is enough, as George Sand has so splendidly shown in
one of her great novels."
"As for the bowings, fasting and all the rest
of it, I don't understand what they have to do with me."
"However busy the
informers may be here, I don't care to become a Jesuit."
"In the year 1847
Byelinsky, who was abroad, sent his famous letter to Gogol, and warmly
reproached him for believing in some sort of God."
"_Entre nous soit dit,_ I
can imagine nothing more comic than the moment when Gogol (the Gogol of
that period!)"
"read that phrase, and... the whole letter!"
"But dismissing
the humorous aspect, and, as I am fundamentally in agreement, I point to
them and say--these were men!"
"They knew how to love their people, they
knew how to suffer for them, they knew how to sacrifice everything for
them, yet they knew how to differ from them when they ought, and did not
filch certain ideas from them."
"Could Byelinsky have sought salvation
in Lenten oil, or peas with radish!..."""
"But at this point Shatov
interposed."
"""Those men of yours never loved the people, they didn't suffer for them,
and didn't sacrifice anything for them, though they may have amused
themselves by imagining it!"""
"he growled sullenly, looking down, and
moving impatiently in his chair."
"""They didn't love the people!"""
yelled Stepan Trofimovitch.
"""Oh, how they
loved Russia!"""
"""Neither Russia nor the people!"""
"Shatov yelled too, with flashing eyes."
"""You can't love what you don't know and they had no conception of the
Russian people."
"All of them peered at the Russian people through their
fingers, and you do too; Byelinsky especially: from that very letter to
Gogol one can see it."
"Byelinsky, like the Inquisitive Man in Krylov's
fable, did not notice the elephant in the museum of curiosities, but
concentrated his whole attention on the French Socialist beetles; he did
not get beyond them."
And yet perhaps he was cleverer than any of you.
"You've not only overlooked the people, you've taken up an attitude of
disgusting contempt for them, if only because you could not imagine any
but the French people, the Parisians indeed, and were ashamed that the
Russians were not like them."
That's the naked truth.
"And he who has
no people has no God."
"You may be sure that all who cease to understand
their own people and lose their connection with them at once lose to
the same extent the faith of their fathers, and become atheistic or
indifferent."
I'm speaking the truth!
"This is a fact which will be
realised."
"That's why all of you and all of us now are either beastly
atheists or careless, dissolute imbeciles, and nothing more."
"And you
too, Stepan Trofimovitch, I don't make an exception of you at all!"
"In
fact, it is on your account I am speaking, let me tell you that!"""
"As a rule, after uttering such monologues (which happened to him pretty
frequently) Shatov snatched up his cap and rushed to the door, in the
full conviction that everything was now over, and that he had cut short
all friendly relations with Stepan Trofimovitch forever."
"But the latter
always succeeded in stopping him in time."
"""Hadn't we better make it up, Shatov, after all these endearments,"" he
would say, benignly holding out his hand to him from his arm-chair."
"Shatov, clumsy and bashful, disliked sentimentality."
"Externally he was
rough, but inwardly, I believe, he had great delicacy."
"Although he often
went too far, he was the first to suffer for it."
"Muttering something
between his teeth in response to Stepan Trofimovitch's appeal, and
shuffling with his feet like a bear, he gave a sudden and unexpected
smile, put down his cap, and sat down in the same chair as before, with
his eyes stubbornly fixed on the ground."
"Wine was, of course, brought
in, and Stepan Trofimovitch proposed some suitable toast, for instance
the memory of some leading man of the past."
CHAPTER II.
PRINCE HARRY.
MATCHMAKING.
"I

THERE WAS ANOTHER being in the world to whom Varvara Petrovna was as
much attached as she was to Stepan Trofimovitch, her only son, Nikolay
Vsyevolodovitch Stavrogin."
"It was to undertake his education that Stepan
Trofimovitch had been engaged."
"The boy was at that time eight years old,
and his frivolous father, General Stavrogin, was already living apart
from Varvara Petrovna, so that the child grew up entirely in his
mother's care."
"To do Stepan Trofimovitch justice, he knew how to win his
pupil's heart."
"The whole secret of this lay in the fact that he was a
child himself."
"I was not there in those days, and he continually felt
the want of a real friend."
"He did not hesitate to make a friend of this
little creature as soon as he had grown a little older."
"It somehow came
to pass quite naturally that there seemed to be no discrepancy of age
between them."
"More than once he awaked his ten- or eleven-year-old
friend at night, simply to pour out his wounded feelings and weep before
him, or to tell him some family secret, without realising that this was
an outrageous proceeding."
"They threw themselves into each other's arms
and wept."
"The boy knew that his mother loved him very much, but I doubt
whether he cared much for her."
"She talked little to him and did not
often interfere with him, but he was always morbidly conscious of her
intent, searching eyes fixed upon him."
"Yet the mother confided his whole
instruction and moral education to Stepan Trofimovitch."
"At that time her
faith in him was unshaken."
"One can't help believing that the tutor had
rather a bad influence on his pupil's nerves."
"When at sixteen he was
taken to a lyceum he was fragile-looking and pale, strangely quiet and
dreamy."
(Later on he was distinguished by great physical strength.)
"One must assume too that the friends went on weeping at night, throwing
themselves in each other's arms, though their tears were not always due
to domestic difficulties."
"Stepan Trofimovitch succeeded in reaching
the deepest chords in his pupil's heart, and had aroused in him a vague
sensation of that eternal, sacred yearning which some elect souls can
never give up for cheap gratification when once they have tasted and
known it."
"(There are some connoisseurs who prize this yearning more than
the most complete satisfaction of it, if such were possible.)"
"But in any
case it was just as well that the pupil and the preceptor were, though
none too soon, parted."
"For the first two years the lad used to come home from the lyceum
for the holidays."
"While Varvara Petrovna and Stepan Trofimovitch were
staying in Petersburg he was sometimes present at the literary evenings
at his mother's, he listened and looked on."
"He spoke little, and was
quiet and shy as before."
"His manner to Stepan Trofimovitch was as
affectionately attentive as ever, but there was a shade of reserve in
it."
"He unmistakably avoided distressing, lofty subjects or reminiscences
of the past."
"By his mother's wish he entered the army on completing
the school course, and soon received a commission in one of the most
brilliant regiments of the Horse Guards."
"He did not come to show himself
to his mother in his uniform, and his letters from Petersburg began to
be infrequent."
"Varvara Petrovna sent him money without stint, though
after the emancipation the revenue from her estate was so diminished
that at first her income was less than half what it had been before."
"She
had, however, a considerable sum laid by through years of economy."
"She took great interest in her son's success in the highest Petersburg
society."
"Where she had failed, the wealthy young officer with
expectations succeeded."
"He renewed acquaintances which she had hardly
dared to dream of, and was welcomed everywhere with pleasure."
"But very
soon rather strange rumours reached Varvara Petrovna."
"The young man
had suddenly taken to riotous living with a sort of frenzy."
"Not that he
gambled or drank too much; there was only talk of savage recklessness,
of running over people in the street with his horses, of brutal conduct
to a lady of good society with whom he had a liaison and whom he
afterwards publicly insulted."
"There was a callous nastiness about this
affair."
"It was added, too, that he had developed into a regular bully,
insulting people for the mere pleasure of insulting them."
"Varvara
Petrovna was greatly agitated and distressed."
"Stepan Trofimovitch
assured her that this was only the first riotous effervescence of a too
richly endowed nature, that the storm would subside and that this was
only like the youth of Prince Harry, who caroused with Falstaff, Poins,
and Mrs. Quickly, as described by Shakespeare."
"This time Varvara Petrovna did not cry out, ""Nonsense, nonsense!"""
"as she
was very apt to do in later years in response to Stepan Trofimovitch."
"On
the contrary she listened very eagerly, asked him to explain this theory
more exactly, took up Shakespeare herself and with great attention read
the immortal chronicle."
"But it did not comfort her, and indeed she did
not find the resemblance very striking."
"With feverish impatience she
awaited answers to some of her letters."
"She had not long to wait for
them."
"The fatal news soon reached her that ""Prince Harry"" had been
involved in two duels almost at once, was entirely to blame for both of
them, had killed one of his adversaries on the spot and had maimed the
other and was awaiting his trial in consequence."
"The case ended in his
being degraded to the ranks, deprived of the rights of a nobleman, and
transferred to an infantry line regiment, and he only escaped worse
punishment by special favour."
"In 1863 he somehow succeeded in distinguishing himself; he received a
cross, was promoted to be a non-commissioned officer, and rose
rapidly to the rank of an officer."
"During this period Varvara Petrovna
despatched perhaps hundreds of letters to the capital, full of prayers
and supplications."
"She even stooped to some humiliation in this
extremity."
"After his promotion the young man suddenly resigned his
commission, but he did not come back to Skvoreshniki again, and gave up
writing to his mother altogether."
"They learned by roundabout means that
he was back in Petersburg, but that he was not to be met in the same
society as before; he seemed to be in hiding."
"They found out that he was
living in strange company, associating with the dregs of the population
of Petersburg, with slip-shod government clerks, discharged military
men, beggars of the higher class, and drunkards of all sorts--that he
visited their filthy families, spent days and nights in dark slums and
all sorts of low haunts, that he had sunk very low, that he was in rags,
and that apparently he liked it."
"He did not ask his mother for money,
he had his own little estate--once the property of his father, General
Stavrogin, which yielded at least some revenue, and which, it was
reported, he had let to a German from Saxony."
"At last his mother
besought him to come to her, and ""Prince Harry"" made his appearance
in our town."
"I had never set eyes on him before, but now I got a very
distinct impression of him."
"He was a very handsome young man of
five-and-twenty, and I must own I was impressed by him."
"I had expected
to see a dirty ragamuffin, sodden with drink and debauchery."
"He was on
the contrary, the most elegant gentleman I had ever met, extremely well
dressed, with an air and manner only to be found in a man accustomed to
culture and refinement."
I was not the only person surprised.
"It was a
surprise to all the townspeople to whom, of course, young Stavrogin's
whole biography was well known in its minutest details, though one could
not imagine how they had got hold of them, and, what was still more
surprising, half of their stories about him turned out to be true."
All our ladies were wild over the new visitor.
"They were sharply divided
into two parties, one of which adored him while the other half regarded
him with a hatred that was almost blood-thirsty: but both were crazy
about him."
"Some of them were particularly fascinated by the idea that he
had perhaps a fateful secret hidden in his soul; others were positively
delighted at the fact that he was a murderer."
"It appeared too that
he had had a very good education and was indeed a man of considerable
culture."
"No great acquirements were needed, of course, to astonish us."
"But he could judge also of very interesting everyday affairs, and, what
was of the utmost value, he judged of them with remarkable good sense."
"I
must mention as a peculiar fact that almost from the first day we all of
us thought him a very sensible fellow."
"He was not very talkative, he was
elegant without exaggeration, surprisingly modest, and at the same time
bold and self-reliant, as none of us were."
"Our dandies gazed at him with
envy, and were completely eclipsed by him."
"His face, too, impressed me."
"His hair was of a peculiarly intense black, his light-coloured eyes were
peculiarly light and calm, his complexion was peculiarly soft and white,
the red in his cheeks was too bright and clear, his teeth were like
pearls, and his lips like coral--one would have thought that he must
be a paragon of beauty, yet at the same time there seemed something
repellent about him."
"It was said that his face suggested a mask; so much
was said though, among other things they talked of his extraordinary
physical strength."
He was rather tall.
"Varvara Petrovna looked at him
with pride, yet with continual uneasiness."
"He spent about six months
among us--listless, quiet, rather morose."
"He made his appearance in
society, and with unfailing propriety performed all the duties demanded
by our provincial etiquette."
"He was related, on his father's side, to
the governor, and was received by the latter as a near kinsman."
"But a
few months passed and the wild beast showed his claws."
"I may observe by the way, in parenthesis, that Ivan Ossipovitch, our
dear mild governor, was rather like an old woman, though he was of good
family and highly connected--which explains the fact that he remained so
long among us, though he steadily avoided all the duties of his office."
"From his munificence and hospitality he ought rather to have been a
marshal of nobility of the good old days than a governor in such busy
times as ours."
"It was always said in the town that it was not he, but
Varvara Petrovna who governed the province."
"Of course this was said
sarcastically; however, it was certainly a falsehood."
"And, indeed, much
wit was wasted on the subject among us."
"On the contrary, in later years,
Varvara Petrovna purposely and consciously withdrew from anything like
a position of authority, and, in spite of the extraordinary respect
in which she was held by the whole province, voluntarily confined her
influence within strict limits set up by herself."
"Instead of these
higher responsibilities she suddenly took up the management of her
estate, and, within two or three years, raised the revenue from it
almost to what it had yielded in the past."
"Giving up her former romantic
impulses (trips to Petersburg, plans for founding a magazine, and so
on) she began to be careful and to save money."
"She kept even Stepan
Trofimovitch at a distance, allowing him to take lodgings in another
house (a change for which he had long been worrying her under various
pretexts)."
"Little by little Stepan Trofimovitch began to call her a
prosaic woman, or more jestingly, ""My prosaic friend."""
"I need hardly say
he only ventured on such jests in an extremely respectful form, and on
rare, and carefully chosen, occasions."
"All of us in her intimate circle felt--Stepan Trofimovitch more acutely
than any of us--that her son had come to her almost, as it were, as a
new hope, and even as a sort of new aspiration."
"Her passion for her son
dated from the time of his successes in Petersburg society, and grew
more intense from the moment that he was degraded in the army."
"Yet she
was evidently afraid of him, and seemed like a slave in his presence."
"It could be seen that she was afraid of something vague and mysterious
which she could not have put into words, and she often stole searching
glances at ""Nicolas,"" scrutinising him reflectively... and behold--the
wild beast suddenly showed his claws."
"II

Suddenly, apropos of nothing, our prince was guilty of incredible
outrages upon various persons and, what was most striking these outrages
were utterly unheard of, quite inconceivable, unlike anything commonly
done, utterly silly and mischievous, quite unprovoked and objectless."
"One of the most respected of our club members, on our committee of
management, Pyotr Pavlovitch Gaganov, an elderly man of high rank in the
service, had formed the innocent habit of declaring vehemently on all
sorts of occasions: ""No, you can't lead me by the nose!"""
"Well, there
is no harm in that."
"But one day at the club, when he brought out this
phrase in connection with some heated discussion in the midst of a
little group of members (all persons of some consequence) Nikolay
Vsyevolodovitch, who was standing on one side, alone and unnoticed,
suddenly went up to Pyotr Pavlovitch, took him unexpectedly and firmly
with two fingers by the nose, and succeeded in leading him two or three
steps across the room."
He could have had no grudge against Mr. Gaganov.
"It might be thought to be a mere schoolboy prank, though, of course, a
most unpardonable one."
"Yet, describing it afterwards, people said that
he looked almost dreamy at the very instant of the operation, ""as though
he had gone out of his mind,"" but that was recalled and reflected upon
long afterwards."
"In the excitement of the moment all they recalled was
the minute after, when he certainly saw it all as it really was, and far
from being confused smiled gaily and maliciously ""without the slightest
regret."""
There was a terrific outcry; he was surrounded.
"Nikolay
Vsyevolodovitch kept turning round, looking about him, answering nobody,
and glancing curiously at the persons exclaiming around him."
"At last he
seemed suddenly, as it were, to sink into thought again--so at least it
was reported--frowned, went firmly up to the affronted Pyotr Pavlovitch,
and with evident vexation said in a rapid mutter:

""You must forgive me, of course..."
"I really don't know what suddenly
came over me... it's silly."""
The carelessness of his apology was almost equivalent to a fresh insult.
The outcry was greater than ever.
"Nikolay Vsyevolodovitch shrugged his
shoulders and went away."
"All this was very stupid, to say nothing of its
gross indecency--

A calculated and premeditated indecency as it seemed at first sight--and
therefore a premeditated and utterly brutal insult to our whole society."
So it was taken to be by every one.
"We began by promptly and unanimously
striking young Stavrogin's name off the list of club members."
"Then it
was decided to send an appeal in the name of the whole club to the
governor, begging him at once (without waiting for the case to be
formally tried in court) to use ""the administrative power entrusted to
him"" to restrain this dangerous ruffian, ""this duelling bully from the
capital, and so protect the tranquillity of all the gentry of our town
from injurious encroachments."""
"It was added with angry resentment that
""a law might be found to control even Mr."
"Stavrogin."""
"This phrase was
prepared by way of a thrust at the governor on account of Varvara
Petrovna."
They elaborated it with relish.
"As ill luck would have it,
the governor was not in the town at the time."
"He had gone to a little
distance to stand godfather to the child of a very charming lady,
recently left a widow in an interesting condition."
"But it was known that
he would soon be back."
"In the meanwhile they got up a regular ovation
for the respected and insulted gentleman; people embraced and kissed
him; the whole town called upon him."
"It was even proposed to give a
subscription dinner in his honour, and they only gave up the idea at
his earnest request--reflecting possibly at last that the man had,
after all, been pulled by the nose and that that was really nothing
to congratulate him upon."
"Yet, how had it happened?"
"How could it have
happened?"
"It is remarkable that no one in the whole town put down this
savage act to madness."
"They must have been predisposed to expect such
actions from Nikolay Vsyevolodovitch, even when he was sane."
"For my part
I don't know to this day how to explain it, in spite of the event that
quickly followed and apparently explained everything, and conciliated
every one."
"I will add also that, four years later, in reply to a
discreet question from me about the incident at the club, Nikolay
Vsyevolodovitch answered, frowning: ""I wasn't quite well at the time."""
But there is no need to anticipate events.
"The general outburst of hatred with which every one fell upon the
""ruffian and duelling bully from the capital"" also struck me as curious."
"They insisted on seeing an insolent design and deliberate intention to
insult our whole society at once."
"The truth was no one liked the fellow,
but, on the contrary, he had set every one against him--and one wonders
how."
"Up to the last incident he had never quarrelled with anyone, nor
insulted anyone, but was as courteous as a gentleman in a fashion-plate,
if only the latter were able to speak."
"I imagine that he was hated for
his pride."
"Even our ladies, who had begun by adoring him, railed against
him now, more loudly than the men."
"Varvara Petrovna was dreadfully
overwhelmed."
"She confessed afterwards to Stepan Trofimovitch that she
had had a foreboding of all this long before, that every day for the
last six months she had been expecting ""just something of that sort,""
a remarkable admission on the part of his own mother."
"""It's begun!"""
"she
thought to herself with a shudder."
"The morning after the incident at the
club she cautiously but firmly approached the subject with her son, but
the poor woman was trembling all over in spite of her firmness."
"She had
not slept all night and even went out early to Stepan Trofimovitch's
lodgings to ask his advice, and shed tears there, a thing which she had
never been known to do before anyone."
"She longed for ""Nicolas"" to say
something to her, to deign to give some explanation."
"Nikolay, who was
always so polite and respectful to his mother, listened to her for some
time scowling, but very seriously."
"He suddenly got up without saying
a word, kissed her hand and went away."
"That very evening, as though by
design, he perpetrated another scandal."
"It was of a more harmless and
ordinary character than the first."
"Yet, owing to the state of the public
mind, it increased the outcry in the town."
"Our friend Liputin turned up and called on Nikolay Vsyevolodovitch
immediately after the latter's interview with his mother, and earnestly
begged for the honour of his company at a little party he was giving for
his wife's birthday that evening."
"Varvara Petrovna had long watched with
a pang at her heart her son's taste for such low company, but she had
not dared to speak of it to him."
"He had made several acquaintances
besides Liputin in the third rank of our society, and even in lower
depths--he had a propensity for making such friends."
"He had never been
in Liputin's house before, though he had met the man himself."
"He guessed
that Liputin's invitation now was the consequence of the previous day's
scandal, and that as a local liberal he was delighted at the scandal,
genuinely believing that that was the proper way to treat stewards at
the club, and that it was very well done."
"Nikolay Vsyevolodovitch smiled
and promised to come."
A great number of guests had assembled.
"The company was not very
presentable, but very sprightly."
"Liputin, vain and envious, only
entertained visitors twice a year, but on those occasions he did
it without stint."
"The most honoured of the invited guests, Stepan
Trofimovitch, was prevented by illness from being present."
"Tea was
handed, and there were refreshments and vodka in plenty."
"Cards were
played at three tables, and while waiting for supper the young people
got up a dance."
"Nikolay Vsyevolodovitch led out Madame Liputin--a very
pretty little woman who was dreadfully shy of him--took two turns round
the room with her, sat down beside her, drew her into conversation and
made her laugh."
"Noticing at last how pretty she was when she laughed, he
suddenly, before all the company, seized her round the waist and
kissed her on the lips two or three times with great relish."
"The poor
frightened lady fainted."
"Nikolay Vsyevolodovitch took his hat and went
up to the husband, who stood petrified in the middle of the general
excitement."
"Looking at him he, too, became confused and muttering
hurriedly ""Don't be angry,"" went away."
"Liputin ran after him in the
entry, gave him his fur-coat with his own hands, and saw him down the
stairs, bowing."
"But next day a rather amusing sequel followed this
comparatively harmless prank--a sequel from which Liputin gained some
credit, and of which he took the fullest possible advantage."
"At ten o'clock in the morning Liputin's servant Agafya, an
easy-mannered, lively, rosy-cheeked peasant woman of thirty, made
her appearance at Stavrogin's house, with a message for Nikolay
Vsyevolodovitch."
"She insisted on seeing ""his honour himself."""
"He had a
very bad headache, but he went out."
"Varvara Petrovna succeeded in being
present when the message was given."
"""Sergay Vassilyevitch"" (Liputin's name), Agafya rattled off briskly,
""bade me first of all give you his respectful greetings and ask after
your health, what sort of night your honour spent after yesterday's
doings, and how your honour feels now after yesterday's doings?"""
Nikolay Vsyevolodovitch smiled.
"""Give him my greetings and thank him, and tell your master from me,
Agafya, that he's the most sensible man in the town."""
"""And he told me to answer that,"" Agafya caught him up still more
briskly, ""that he knows that without your telling him, and wishes you
the same."""
"""Really!"
"But how could he tell what I should say to you?"""
"""I can't say in what way he could tell, but when I had set off and had
gone right down the street, I heard something, and there he was, running
after me without his cap."
"'I say, Agafya, if by any chance he says to
you, ""Tell your master that he has more sense than all the town,"" you
tell him at once, don't forget, ""The master himself knows that very
well, and wishes you the same.""'"""
"III

At last the interview with the governor took place too."
"Our dear, mild,
Ivan Ossipovitch had only just returned and only just had time to hear
the angry complaint from the club."
"There was no doubt that something
must be done, but he was troubled."
"The hospitable old man seemed also
rather afraid of his young kinsman."
"He made up his mind, however, to
induce him to apologise to the club and to his victim in satisfactory
form, and, if required, by letter, and then to persuade him to leave us
for a time, travelling, for instance, to improve his mind, in Italy, or
in fact anywhere abroad."
"In the waiting-room in which on this occasion
he received Nikolay Vsyevolodovitch (who had been at other times
privileged as a relation to wander all over the house unchecked),
Alyosha Telyatnikov, a clerk of refined manners, who was also a member
of the governor's household, was sitting in a corner opening envelopes
at a table, and in the next room, at the window nearest to the door, a
stout and sturdy colonel, a former friend and colleague of the governor,
was sitting alone reading the Golos, paying no attention, of course,
to what was taking place in the waiting-room; in fact, he had his back
turned."
"Ivan Ossipovitch approached the subject in a roundabout way,
almost in a whisper, but kept getting a little muddled."
"Nikolay looked
anything but cordial, not at all as a relation should."
"He was pale and
sat looking down and continually moving his eyebrows as though trying to
control acute pain."
"""You have a kind heart and a generous one, Nicolas,"" the old man put in
among other things, ""you're a man of great culture, you've grown up in
the highest circles, and here too your behaviour has hitherto been a
model, which has been a great consolation to your mother, who is so
precious to all of us.... And now again everything has appeared in such
an unaccountable light, so detrimental to all!"
"I speak as a friend of
your family, as an old man who loves you sincerely and a relation, at
whose words you cannot take offence.... Tell me, what drives you to such
reckless proceedings so contrary to all accepted rules and habits?"
"What
can be the meaning of such acts which seem almost like outbreaks of
delirium?"""
Nikolay listened with vexation and impatience.
"All at once there was a
gleam of something sly and mocking in his eyes."
"""I'll tell you what drives me to it,"" he said sullenly, and looking
round him he bent down to Ivan Ossipovitch's ear."
"The refined Alyosha
Telyatnikov moved three steps farther away towards the window, and the
colonel coughed over the Golos."
"Poor Ivan Ossipovitch hurriedly and
trustfully inclined his ear; he was exceedingly curious."
"And then
something utterly incredible, though on the other side only too
unmistakable, took place."
"The old man suddenly felt that, instead of
telling him some interesting secret, Nikolay had seized the upper
part of his ear between his teeth and was nipping it rather hard."
"He
shuddered, and breath failed him."
"""Nicolas, this is beyond a joke!"""
"he moaned mechanically in a voice not
his own."
"Alyosha and the colonel had not yet grasped the situation, besides they
couldn't see, and fancied up to the end that the two were whispering
together; and yet the old man's desperate face alarmed them."
"They looked
at one another with wide-open eyes, not knowing whether to rush to his
assistance as agreed or to wait."
"Nikolay noticed this perhaps, and bit
the harder."
"""Nicolas!"
"Nicolas!"""
"his victim moaned again, ""come... you've had your
joke, that's enough!"""
"In another moment the poor governor would certainly have died of terror;
but the monster had mercy on him, and let go his ear."
"The old man's
deadly terror lasted for a full minute, and it was followed by a sort of
fit."
"Within half an hour Nikolay was arrested and removed for the time
to the guard-room, where he was confined in a special cell, with a
special sentinel at the door."
"This decision was a harsh one, but
our mild governor was so angry that he was prepared to take the
responsibility even if he had to face Varvara Petrovna."
"To the general
amazement, when this lady arrived at the governor's in haste and in
nervous irritation to discuss the matter with him at once, she was
refused admittance, whereupon, without getting out of the carriage, she
returned home, unable to believe her senses."
And at last everything was explained!
"At two o'clock in the morning
the prisoner, who had till then been calm and had even slept, suddenly
became noisy, began furiously beating on the door with his fists,--with
unnatural strength wrenched the iron grating off the door, broke the
window, and cut his hands all over."
"When the officer on duty ran with
a detachment of men and the keys and ordered the cell to be opened
that they might rush in and bind the maniac, it appeared that he was
suffering from acute brain fever."
He was taken home to his mother.
Everything was explained at once.
"All our three doctors gave it as their
opinion that the patient might well have been in a delirious state for
three days before, and that though he might have apparently been in
possession of full consciousness and cunning, yet he might have been
deprived of common sense and will, which was indeed borne out by the
facts."
"So it turned out that Liputin had guessed the truth sooner than
any one."
"Ivan Ossipovitch, who was a man of delicacy and feeling,
was completely abashed."
"But what was striking was that he, too, had
considered Nikolay Vsyevolodovitch capable of any mad action even when
in the full possession of his faculties."
"At the club, too, people were
ashamed and wondered how it was they had failed to ""see the elephant""
and had missed the only explanation of all these marvels: there were,
of course, sceptics among them, but they could not long maintain their
position."
Nikolay was in bed for more than two months.
"A famous doctor was
summoned from Moscow for a consultation; the whole town called on
Varvara Petrovna."
She forgave them.
"When in the spring Nikolay had
completely recovered and assented without discussion to his mother's
proposal that he should go for a tour to Italy, she begged him further
to pay visits of farewell to all the neighbours, and so far as possible
to apologise where necessary."
Nikolay agreed with great alacrity.
"It
became known at the club that he had had a most delicate explanation
with Pyotr Pavlovitch Gaganov, at the house of the latter, who had been
completely satisfied with his apology."
"As he went round to pay these
calls Nikolay was very grave and even gloomy."
"Every one appeared to
receive him sympathetically, but everybody seemed embarrassed and glad
that he was going to Italy."
"Ivan Ossipovitch was positively tearful, but
was, for some reason, unable to bring himself to embrace him, even
at the final leave-taking."
"It is true that some of us retained the
conviction that the scamp had simply been making fun of us, and that the
illness was neither here nor there."
He went to see Liputin too.
"""Tell me,"" he said, ""how could you guess beforehand what I should say
about your sense and prime Agafya with an answer to it?"""
"""Why,"" laughed Liputin, ""it was because I recognised that you were a
clever man, and so I foresaw what your answer would be."""
"""Anyway, it was a remarkable coincidence."
"But, excuse me, did you
consider me a sensible man and not insane when you sent Agafya?"""
"""For the cleverest and most rational, and I only pretended to believe
that you were insane.... And you guessed at once what was in my mind,
and sent a testimonial to my wit through Agafya."""
"""Well, there you're a little mistaken."
"I really was... unwell...""
muttered Nikolay Vsyevolodovitch, frowning."
"""Bah!"""
"he cried, ""do you
suppose I'm capable of attacking people when I'm in my senses?"
"What
object would there be in it?"""
Liputin shrank together and didn't know what to answer.
"Nikolay turned
pale or, at least, so it seemed to Liputin."
"""You have a very peculiar way of looking at things, anyhow,"" Nikolay
went on, ""but as for Agafya, I understand, of course, that you simply
sent her to be rude to me."""
"""I couldn't challenge you to a duel, could I?"""
"""Oh, no, of course!"
"I seem to have heard that you're not fond of
duels....""

""Why borrow from the French?"""
"said Liputin, doubling up again."
"""You're for nationalism, then?"""
Liputin shrank into himself more than ever.
"""Bah, bah!"
"What do I see?"""
"cried Nicolas, noticing a volume of Considérant
in the most conspicuous place on the table."
"""You don't mean to say
you're a Fourierist!"
I'm afraid you must be!
"And isn't this too
borrowing from the French?"""
"he laughed, tapping the book with his
finger."
"""No, that's not taken from the French,"" Liputin cried with positive
fury, jumping up from his chair."
"""That is taken from the universal
language of humanity, not simply from the French."
"From the language of
the universal social republic and harmony of mankind, let me tell you!"
"Not simply from the French!"""
"""Foo!"
hang it all!
"There's no such language!"""
laughed Nikolay.
"Sometimes a trifle will catch the attention and exclusively absorb it
for a time."
"Most of what I have to tell of young Stavrogin will come
later."
"But I will note now as a curious fact that of all the impressions
made on him by his stay in our town, the one most sharply imprinted
on his memory was the unsightly and almost abject figure of the little
provincial official, the coarse and jealous family despot, the miserly
money-lender who picked up the candle-ends and scraps left from dinner,
and was at the same time a passionate believer in some visionary future
""social harmony,"" who at night gloated in ecstasies over fantastic
pictures of a future phalanstery, in the approaching realisation of
which, in Russia, and in our province, he believed as firmly as in his
own existence."
"And that in the very place where he had saved up to
buy himself a ""little home,"" where he had married for the second time,
getting a dowry with his bride, where perhaps, for a hundred miles round
there was not one man, himself included, who was the very least like a
future member ""of the universal human republic and social harmony."""
"""God knows how these people come to exist!"""
"Nikolay wondered, recalling
sometimes the unlooked-for Fourierist."
"IV

Our prince travelled for over three years, so that he was almost
forgotten in the town."
"We learned from Stepan Trofimovitch that he
had travelled all over Europe, that he had even been in Egypt and had
visited Jerusalem, and then had joined some scientific expedition to
Iceland, and he actually did go to Iceland."
"It was reported too that he
had spent one winter attending lectures in a German university."
"He did
not write often to his mother, twice a year, or even less, but Varvara
Petrovna was not angry or offended at this."
"She accepted submissively
and without repining the relations that had been established once for
all between her son and herself."
"She fretted for her ""Nicolas"" and
dreamed of him continually."
"She kept her dreams and lamentations to
herself."
"She seemed to have become less intimate even with Stepan
Trofimovitch."
"She was forming secret projects, and seemed to have become
more careful about money than ever."
"She was more than ever given to
saving money and being angry at Stepan Trofimovitch's losses at cards."
"At last, in the April of this year, she received a letter from Paris
from Praskovya Ivanovna Drozdov, the widow of the general and the
friend of Varvara Petrovna's childhood."
"Praskovya Ivanovna, whom Varvara
Petrovna had not seen or corresponded with for eight years, wrote,
informing her that Nikolay Vsyevolodovitch had become very intimate
with them and a great friend of her only daughter, Liza, and that he was
intending to accompany them to Switzerland, to Verney-Montreux,
though in the household of Count K. (a very influential personage in
Petersburg), who was now staying in Paris."
"He was received like a son
of the family, so that he almost lived at the count's."
"The letter was
brief, and the object of it was perfectly clear, though it contained
only a plain statement of the above-mentioned facts without drawing any
inferences from them."
"Varvara Petrovna did not pause long to consider;
she made up her mind instantly, made her preparations, and taking with
her her protégée, Dasha (Shatov's sister), she set off in the middle of
April for Paris, and from there went on to Switzerland."
"She returned in
July, alone, leaving Dasha with the Drozdovs."
"She brought us the news
that the Drozdovs themselves had promised to arrive among us by the end
of August."
"The Drozdovs, too, were landowners of our province, but the official
duties of General Ivan Ivanovitch Drozdov (who had been a friend
of Varvara Petrovna's and a colleague of her husband's) had always
prevented them from visiting their magnificent estate."
"On the death of
the general, which had taken place the year before, the inconsolable
widow had gone abroad with her daughter, partly in order to try the
grape-cure which she proposed to carry out at Verney-Montreux during the
latter half of the summer."
"On their return to Russia they intended to
settle in our province for good."
"She had a large house in the town which
had stood empty for many years with the windows nailed up."
"They were
wealthy people."
"Praskovya Ivanovna had been, in her first marriage, a
Madame Tushin, and like her school-friend, Varvara Petrovna, was the
daughter of a government contractor of the old school, and she too had
been an heiress at her marriage."
"Tushin, a retired cavalry captain, was
also a man of means, and of some ability."
"At his death he left a snug
fortune to his only daughter Liza, a child of seven."
"Now that Lizaveta
Nikolaevna was twenty-two her private fortune might confidently be
reckoned at 200,000 roubles, to say nothing of the property--which was
bound to come to her at the death of her mother, who had no children by
her second marriage."
"Varvara Petrovna seemed to be very well satisfied
with her expedition."
"In her own opinion she had succeeded in coming to
a satisfactory understanding with Praskovya Ivanovna, and immediately
on her arrival she confided everything to Stepan Trofimovitch."
"She was
positively effusive with him as she had not been for a very long time."
"""Hurrah!"""
"cried Stepan Trofimovitch, and snapped his fingers."
"He was in a perfect rapture, especially as he had spent the whole time
of his friend's absence in extreme dejection."
"On setting off she had not
even taken leave of him properly, and had said nothing of her plan to
""that old woman,"" dreading, perhaps, that he might chatter about it."
"She was cross with him at the time on account of a considerable gambling
debt which she had suddenly discovered."
"But before she left Switzerland
she had felt that on her return she must make up for it to her forsaken
friend, especially as she had treated him very curtly for a long time
past."
"Her abrupt and mysterious departure had made a profound and
poignant impression on the timid heart of Stepan Trofimovitch, and to
make matters worse he was beset with other difficulties at the same
time."
"He was worried by a very considerable money obligation, which had
weighed upon him for a long time and which he could never hope to meet
without Varvara Petrovna's assistance."
"Moreover, in the May of this
year, the term of office of our mild and gentle Ivan Ossipovitch came to
an end."
He was superseded under rather unpleasant circumstances.
"Then,
while Varvara Petrovna was still away, there followed the arrival of
our new governor, Andrey Antonovitch von Lembke, and with that a change
began at once to be perceptible in the attitude of almost the whole
of our provincial society towards Varvara Petrovna, and consequently
towards Stepan Trofimovitch."
"He had already had time anyway to make some
disagreeable though valuable observations, and seemed very apprehensive
alone without Varvara Petrovna."
"He had an agitating suspicion that he
had already been mentioned to the governor as a dangerous man."
"He knew
for a fact that some of our ladies meant to give up calling on Varvara
Petrovna."
"Of our governor's wife (who was only expected to arrive in the
autumn) it was reported that though she was, so it was heard, proud,
she was a real aristocrat, and ""not like that poor Varvara Petrovna."""
"Everybody seemed to know for a fact, and in the greatest detail, that
our governor's wife and Varvara Petrovna had met already in society and
had parted enemies, so that the mere mention of Madame von Lembke's name
would, it was said, make a painful impression on Varvara Petrovna."
"The confident and triumphant air of Varvara Petrovna, the contemptuous
indifference with which she heard of the opinions of our provincial
ladies and the agitation in local society, revived the flagging spirits
of Stepan Trofimovitch and cheered him up at once."
"With peculiar,
gleefully-obsequious humour, he was beginning to describe the new
governor's arrival."
"""You are no doubt aware, _excellente amie_,"" he said, jauntily
and coquettishly drawling his words, ""what is meant by a Russian
administrator, speaking generally, and what is meant by a new Russian
administrator, that is the newly-baked, newly-established... _ces
interminables mots Russes!_ But I don't think you can know in practice
what is meant by administrative ardour, and what sort of thing that is."""
"""Administrative ardour?"
"I don't know what that is."""
"""Well... _Vous savez chez nous... En un mot,_  set the most insignificant
nonentity to sell miserable tickets at a railway station, and the
nonentity will at once feel privileged to look down on you like a
Jupiter, _pour montrer son pouvoir_ when you go to take a ticket."
"'Now
then,' he says, 'I shall show you my power'... and in them it comes to a
genuine, administrative ardour."
"_En un mot,_ I've read that some verger
in one of our Russian churches abroad--_mais c'est très curieux_--drove,
literally drove a distinguished English family, _les dames charmantes_,
out of the church before the beginning of the Lenten service... _vous
savez ces chants et le livre de Job_... on the simple pretext that
'foreigners are not allowed to loaf about a Russian church, and that
they must come at the time fixed....' And he sent them into fainting
fits.... That verger was suffering from an attack of administrative
ardour, _et il a montré son pouvoir_."""
"""Cut it short if you can, Stepan Trofimovitch."""
"""Mr. von Lembke is making a tour of the province now."
"_En un mot,_ this
Andrey Antonovitch, though he is a russified German and of the Orthodox
persuasion, and even--I will say that for him--a remarkably handsome man
of about forty...""

""What makes you think he's a handsome man?"
"He has eyes like a sheep's."""
"""Precisely so."
"But in this I yield, of course, to the opinion of our
ladies."""
"""Let's get on, Stepan Trofimovitch, I beg you!"
"By the way, you're
wearing a red neck-tie."
"Is it long since you've taken to it?"""
"""I've..."
"I've only put it on to-day."""
"""And do you take your constitutional?"
"Do you go for a four-mile walk
every day as the doctor told you to?"""
"""N-not..."
"always."""
"""I knew you didn't!"
"I felt sure of that when I was in Switzerland!"""
"she
cried irritably."
"""Now you must go not four but six miles a day!"
"You've
grown terribly slack, terribly, terribly!"
"You're not simply getting old,
you're getting decrepit.... You shocked me when I first saw you just
now, in spite of your red tie, _quelle idee rouge_!"
"Go on about Von
Lembke if you've really something to tell me, and do finish some time, I
entreat you, I'm tired."""
"""_En un mot,_ I only wanted to say that he is one of those administrators
who begin to have power at forty, who, till they're forty, have been
stagnating in insignificance and then suddenly come to the front through
suddenly acquiring a wife, or some other equally desperate means....
That is, he has gone away now... that is, I mean to say, it was at once
whispered in both his ears that I am a corrupter of youth, and a hot-bed
of provincial atheism...."
"He began making inquiries at once."""
"""Is that true?"""
"""I took steps about it, in fact."
"When he was 'informed' that you 'ruled
the province,' _vous savez,_ he allowed himself to use the expression that
'there shall be nothing of that sort in the future.'"""
"""Did he say that?"""
"""That 'there shall be nothing of the sort in future,' and, _avec cette
morgue_.... His wife, Yulia Mihailovna, we shall behold at the end of
August, she's coming straight from Petersburg."""
"""From abroad."
"We met there."""
"_""Vraiment?"
"""_

""In Paris and in Switzerland."
"She's related to the Drozdovs."""
"""Related!"
What an extraordinary coincidence!
"They say she is ambitious
and... supposed to have great connections."""
"""Nonsense!"
Connections indeed!
"She was an old maid without a farthing
till she was five-and-forty."
"But now she's hooked her Von Lembke,
and, of course, her whole object is to push him forward."
"They're both
intriguers."""
"""And they say she's two years older than he is?"""
"""Five."
"Her mother used to wear out her skirts on my doorsteps in Moscow;
she used to beg for an invitation to our balls as a favour when my
husband was living."
"And this creature used to sit all night alone in a
corner without dancing, with her turquoise fly on her forehead, so that
simply from pity I used to have to send her her first partner at two
o'clock in the morning."
"She was five-and-twenty then, and they used to
rig her out in short skirts like a little girl."
"It was improper to have
them about at last."""
"""I seem to see that fly."""
"""I tell you, as soon as I arrived I was in the thick of an intrigue."
"You
read Madame Drozdov's letter, of course."
What could be clearer?
"What did
I find?"
"That fool Praskovya herself--she always was a fool--looked at
me as much as to ask why I'd come."
You can fancy how surprised I was.
"I looked round, and there was that Lembke woman at her tricks, and that
cousin of hers--old Drozdov's nephew--it was all clear."
"You may be sure
I changed all that in a twinkling, and Praskovya is on my side again,
but what an intrigue!"""
"""In which you came off victor, however."
"Bismarck!"""
"""Without being a Bismarck I'm equal to falseness and stupidity wherever
I meet it, falseness, and Praskovya's folly."
"I don't know when I've met
such a flabby woman, and what's more her legs are swollen, and she's
a good-natured simpleton, too."
"What can be more foolish than a
good-natured simpleton?"""
"""A spiteful fool, _ma bonne amie,_ a spiteful fool is still more foolish,""
Stepan Trofimovitch protested magnanimously."
"""You're right, perhaps."
"Do you remember Liza?"""
"_""Charmante enfant!"
"""_

""But she's not an _enfant_ now, but a woman, and a woman of character."
"She's a generous, passionate creature, and what I like about her, she
stands up to that confiding fool, her mother."
"There was almost a row
over that cousin."""
"""Bah, and of course he's no relation of Lizaveta Nikolaevna's at
all.... Has he designs on her?"""
"""You see, he's a young officer, not by any means talkative, modest in
fact."
I always want to be just.
"I fancy he is opposed to the intrigue
himself, and isn't aiming at anything, and it was only the Von Lembke's
tricks."
He had a great respect for Nicolas.
"You understand, it all
depends on Liza."
"But I left her on the best of terms with Nicolas,
and he promised he would come to us in November."
"So it's only the Von
Lembke who is intriguing, and Praskovya is a blind woman."
"She suddenly
tells me that all my suspicions are fancy."
"I told her to her face she
was a fool."
I am ready to repeat it at the day of judgment.
"And if it
hadn't been for Nicolas begging me to leave it for a time, I wouldn't
have come away without unmasking that false woman."
"She's been trying
to ingratiate herself with Count K. through Nicolas."
"She wants to
come between mother and son."
"But Liza's on our side, and I came to an
understanding with Praskovya."
"Do you know that Karmazinov is a relation
of hers?"""
"""What?"
"A relation of Madame von Lembke?"""
"""Yes, of hers."
"Distant."""
"""Karmazinov, the novelist?"""
"""Yes, the writer."
Why does it surprise you?
"Of course he considers
himself a great man."
Stuck-up creature!
She's coming here with him.
"Now
she's making a fuss of him out there."
"She's got a notion of setting up a
sort of literary society here."
"He's coming for a month, he wants to sell
his last piece of property here."
"I very nearly met him in Switzerland,
and was very anxious not to."
"Though I hope he will deign to recognise
me."
"He wrote letters to me in the old days, he has been in my house."
"I should like you to dress better, Stepan Trofimovitch; you're growing
more slovenly every day.... Oh, how you torment me!"
"What are you reading
now?"""
"""I..."
"I...""

""I understand."
"The same as ever, friends and drinking, the club and
cards, and the reputation of an atheist."
"I don't like that reputation,
Stepan Trofimovitch; I don't care for you to be called an atheist,
particularly now."
"I didn't care for it in old days, for it's all nothing
but empty chatter."
"It must be said at last."""
"_""Mais, ma chère...""_

""Listen, Stepan Trofimovitch, of course I'm ignorant compared with you
on all learned subjects, but as I was travelling here I thought a great
deal about you."
"I've come to one conclusion."""
"""What conclusion?"""
"""That you and I are not the wisest people in the world, but that there
are people wiser than we are."""
"""Witty and apt."
"If there are people wiser than we are, then there are
people more right than we are, and we may be mistaken, you mean?"
"_Mais,
ma bonne amie,_ granted that I may make a mistake, yet have I not the
common, human, eternal, supreme right of freedom of conscience?"
"I have
the right not to be bigoted or superstitious if I don't wish to, and for
that I shall naturally be hated by certain persons to the end of time."
"_Et puis, comme on trouve toujours plus de moines que de raison,_ and as I
thoroughly agree with that...""

""What, what did you say?"""
"""I said, _on trouve toujours plus de moines que de raison,_ and as I
thoroughly...""

""I'm sure that's not your saying."
"You must have taken it from
somewhere."""
"""It was Pascal said that."""
"""Just as I thought...it's not your own."
"Why don't you ever say anything
like that yourself, so shortly and to the point, instead of dragging
things out to such a length?"
"That's much better than what you said just
now about administrative ardour...""

_""Ma foi, chère..."" _why?"
"In the first place probably because I'm not
a Pascal after all, _et puis_... secondly, we Russians never can say
anything in our own language.... We never have said anything hitherto,
at any rate....""

""H'm!"
"That's not true, perhaps."
"Anyway, you'd better make a note of such
phrases, and remember them, you know, in case you have to talk....
Ach, Stephan Trofimovitch."
"I have come to talk to you seriously, quite
seriously."""
"_""Chère, chère amie!"
"""_

""Now that all these Von Lembkes and Karmazinovs.... Oh, my goodness, how
you have deteriorated!..."
"Oh, my goodness, how you do torment me!..."
"I should have liked these people to feel a respect for you, for they're
not worth your little finger--but the way you behave!..."
"What will they
see?"
What shall I have to show them?
"Instead of nobly standing as an
example, keeping up the tradition of the past, you surround yourself
with a wretched rabble, you have picked up impossible habits, you've
grown feeble, you can't do without wine and cards, you read nothing
but Paul de Kock, and write nothing, while all of them write; all your
time's wasted in gossip."
"How can you bring yourself to be friends with a
wretched creature like your inseparable Liputin?"""
"""Why is he _mine_ and _inseparable_?"""
"Stepan Trofimovitch protested
timidly."
"""Where is he now?"""
"Varvara Petrovna went on, sharply and sternly."
"""He... he has an infinite respect for you, and he's gone to S----k, to
receive an inheritance left him by his mother."""
"""He seems to do nothing but get money."
And how's Shatov?
"Is he just the
same?"""
"_""Irascible, mais bon."
"""_

""I can't endure your Shatov."
"He's spiteful and he thinks too much of
himself."""
"""How is Darya Pavlovna?"""
"""You mean Dasha?"
"What made you think of her?"""
"Varvara Petrovna looked
at him inquisitively."
"""She's quite well."
I left her with the Drozdovs.
"I
heard something about your son in Switzerland."
"Nothing good."""
"_""Oh, c'est un histoire bien bête!"
"Je vous attendais, ma bonne amie, pour
vous raconter...""_

""Enough, Stepan Trofimovitch."
Leave me in peace.
I'm worn out.
"We
shall have time to talk to our heart's content, especially of what's
unpleasant."
"You've begun to splutter when you laugh, it's a sign of
senility!"
And what a strange way of laughing you've taken to!...
"Good
Heavens, what a lot of bad habits you've fallen into!"
"Karmazinov won't
come and see you!"
"And people are only too glad to make the most of
anything as it is.... You've betrayed yourself completely now."
"Well,
come, that's enough, that's enough, I'm tired."
"You really might have
mercy upon one!"""
"Stepan Trofimovitch ""had mercy,"" but he withdrew in great perturbation."
"V

Our friend certainly had fallen into not a few bad habits, especially of
late."
"He had obviously and rapidly deteriorated; and it was true that
he had become slovenly."
"He drank more and had become more tearful and
nervous; and had grown too impressionable on the artistic side."
"His
face had acquired a strange facility for changing with extraordinary
quickness, from the most solemn expression, for instance, to the most
absurd, and even foolish."
"He could not endure solitude, and was always
craving for amusement."
"One had always to repeat to him some gossip, some
local anecdote, and every day a new one."
"If no one came to see him for
a long time he wandered disconsolately about the rooms, walked to the
window, puckering up his lips, heaved deep sighs, and almost fell to
whimpering at last."
"He was always full of forebodings, was afraid of
something unexpected and inevitable; he had become timorous; he began to
pay great attention to his dreams."
"He spent all that day and evening in great depression, he sent for me,
was very much agitated, talked a long while, gave me a long account of
things, but all rather disconnected."
"Varvara Petrovna had known for a
long time that he concealed nothing from me."
"It seemed to me at last
that he was worried about something particular, and was perhaps unable
to form a definite idea of it himself."
"As a rule when we met _tête-à-tête_
and he began making long complaints to me, a bottle was almost always
brought in after a little time, and things became much more comfortable."
"This time there was no wine, and he was evidently struggling all the
while against the desire to send for it."
"""And why is she always so cross?"""
"he complained every minute, like a
child."
"_""Tous les hommes de génie et de progrès en Russie étaient,
sont, et seront toujours des_ gamblers _et des_ drunkards _qui boivent_ in
outbreaks... and I'm not such a gambler after all, and I'm not such a
drunkard."
She reproaches me for not writing anything.
"Strange
idea!..."
She asks why I lie down?
"She says I ought to stand, 'an example
and reproach.'"
"_Mais, entre nous soit dit,_ what is a man to do who is
destined to stand as a 'reproach,' if not to lie down?"
"Does she
understand that?"""
"And at last it became clear to me what was the chief particular trouble
which was worrying him so persistently at this time."
"Many times that
evening he went to the looking-glass, and stood a long while before
it."
"At last he turned from the looking-glass to me, and with a sort
of strange despair, said: ""_Mon cher, je suis un_ broken-down man."""
"Yes,
certainly, up to that time, up to that very day there was one thing only
of which he had always felt confident in spite of the ""new views,"" and
of the ""change in Varvara Petrovna's ideas,"" that was, the conviction
that still he had a fascination for her feminine heart, not simply as an
exile or a celebrated man of learning, but as a handsome man."
"For twenty
years this soothing and flattering opinion had been rooted in his mind,
and perhaps of all his convictions this was the hardest to part with."
"Had he any presentiment that evening of the colossal ordeal which was
preparing for him in the immediate future?"
"VI

I will now enter upon the description of that almost forgotten incident
with which my story properly speaking begins."
At last at the very end of August the Drozdovs returned.
"Their arrival
made a considerable sensation in local society, and took place shortly
before their relation, our new governor's wife, made her long-expected
appearance."
But of all these interesting events I will speak later.
"For the present I will confine myself to saying that Praskovya Ivanovna
brought Varvara Petrovna, who was expecting her so impatiently, a most
perplexing problem: Nikolay had parted from them in July, and,
meeting Count K. on the Rhine, had set off with him and his family for
Petersburg."
"(N.B.--The Count's three daughters were all of marriageable
age.)"
"""Lizaveta is so proud and obstinate that I could get nothing out of
her,"" Praskovya Ivanovna said in conclusion."
"""But I saw for myself that
something had happened between her and Nikolay Vsyevolodovitch."
"I don't
know the reasons, but I fancy, my dear Varvara Petrovna, that you
will have to ask your Darya Pavlovna for them."
"To my thinking Liza
was offended."
I'm glad.
"I can tell you that I've brought you back your
favourite at last and handed her over to you; it's a weight off my
mind."""
These venomous words were uttered with remarkable irritability.
"It was
evident that the ""flabby"" woman had prepared them and gloated beforehand
over the effect they would produce."
"But Varvara Petrovna was not the
woman to be disconcerted by sentimental effects and enigmas."
"She sternly
demanded the most precise and satisfactory explanations."
"Praskovya
Ivanovna immediately lowered her tone and even ended by dissolving into
tears and expressions of the warmest friendship."
"This irritable but
sentimental lady, like Stepan Trofimovitch, was forever yearning for
true friendship, and her chief complaint against her daughter Lizaveta
Nikolaevna was just that ""her daughter was not a friend to her."""
"But from all her explanations and outpourings nothing certain could be
gathered but that there actually had been some sort of quarrel between
Liza and Nikolay, but of the nature of the quarrel Praskovya Ivanovna
was obviously unable to form a definite idea."
"As for her imputations
against Darya Pavlovna, she not only withdrew them completely in the
end, but even particularly begged Varvara Petrovna to pay no attention
to her words, because ""they had been said in irritation."""
"In fact, it
had all been left very far from clear--suspicious, indeed."
"According to
her account the quarrel had arisen from Liza's ""obstinate and ironical
character."""
"""Nikolay Vsyevolodovitch is proud, too, and though he
was very much in love, yet he could not endure sarcasm, and began to be
sarcastic himself."
"Soon afterwards we made the acquaintance of a
young man, the nephew, I believe, of your 'Professor' and, indeed, the
surname's the same."""
"""The son, not the nephew,"" Varvara Petrovna corrected her."
"Even in old days Praskovya Ivanovna had been always unable to recall
Stepan Trofimovitch's name, and had always called him the ""Professor."""
"""Well, his son, then; so much the better."
"Of course, it's all the same
to me."
"An ordinary young man, very lively and free in his manners, but
nothing special in him."
"Well, then, Liza herself did wrong, she
made friends with the young man with the idea of making Nikolay
Vsyevolodovitch jealous."
"I don't see much harm in that; it's the way of
girls, quite usual, even charming in them."
"Only instead of being jealous
Nikolay Vsyevolodovitch made friends with the young man himself, just as
though he saw nothing and didn't care."
This made Liza furious.
"The young
man soon went away (he was in a great hurry to get somewhere) and
Liza took to picking quarrels with Nikolay Vsyevolodovitch at every
opportunity."
"She noticed that he used sometimes to talk to Dasha; and,
well, she got in such a frantic state that even my life wasn't worth
living, my dear."
"The doctors have forbidden my being irritated, and I
was so sick of their lake they make such a fuss about, it simply gave me
toothache, I had such rheumatism."
"It's stated in print that the Lake of
Geneva does give people the toothache."
It's a feature of the place.
"Then
Nikolay Vsyevolodovitch suddenly got a letter from the countess and he
left us at once."
He packed up in one day.
"They parted in a friendly way,
and Liza became very cheerful and frivolous, and laughed a great deal
seeing him off; only that was all put on."
"When he had gone she became
very thoughtful, and she gave up speaking of him altogether and wouldn't
let me mention his name."
"And I should advise you, dear Varvara Petrovna,
not to approach the subject with Liza, you'll only do harm."
"But if you
hold your tongue she'll begin to talk of it herself, and then you'll
learn more."
"I believe they'll come together again, if only Nikolay
Vsyevolodovitch doesn't put off coming, as he promised."""
"""I'll write to him at once."
"If that's how it was, there was nothing in
the quarrel; all nonsense!"
And I know Darya too well.
"It's nonsense!"""
"""I'm sorry for what I said about Dashenka, I did wrong."
"Their
conversations were quite ordinary and they talked out loud, too."
"But it
all upset me so much at the time, my dear."
"And Liza, I saw, got on with
her again as affectionately as before....""

That very day Varvara Petrovna wrote to Nikolay, and begged him to come,
if only one month, earlier than the date he had fixed."
"But yet she still
felt that there was something unexplained and obscure in the matter."
She pondered over it all the evening and all night.
"Praskovya's opinion
seemed to her too innocent and sentimental."
"""Praskovya has always
been too sentimental from the old schooldays upwards,"" she reflected."
"""Nicolas is not the man to run away from a girl's taunts."
"There's some
other reason for it, if there really has been a breach between them."
"That officer's here though, they've brought him with them."
"As a relation
he lives in their house."
"And, as for Darya, Praskovya was in too much
haste to apologise."
"She must have kept something to herself, which she
wouldn't tell me."""
"By the morning Varvara Petrovna had matured a project for putting a stop
once for all to one misunderstanding at least; a project amazing in its
unexpectedness."
What was in her heart when she conceived it?
"It would
be hard to decide and I will not undertake to explain beforehand all
the incongruities of which it was made up."
"I simply confine myself as
chronicler to recording events precisely as they happened, and it is not
my fault if they seem incredible."
"Yet I must once more testify that by
the morning there was not the least suspicion of Dasha left in Varvara
Petrovna's mind, though in reality there never had been any--she had
too much confidence in her."
"Besides, she could not admit the idea that
""Nicolas"" could be attracted by her Darya."
"Next morning when Darya
Pavlovna was pouring out tea at the table Varvara Petrovna looked for a
long while intently at her and, perhaps for the twentieth time since the
previous day, repeated to herself: ""It's all nonsense!"""
"All she noticed was that Dasha looked rather tired, and that she was
even quieter and more apathetic than she used to be."
"After their morning
tea, according to their invariable custom, they sat down to needlework."
"Varvara Petrovna demanded from her a full account of her impressions
abroad, especially of nature, of the inhabitants, of the towns, the
customs, their arts and commerce--of everything she had time to observe."
"She asked no questions about the Drozdovs or how she had got on with
them."
"Dasha, sitting beside her at the work-table helping her with the
embroidery, talked for half an hour in her even, monotonous, but rather
weak voice."
"""Darya!"""
"Varvara Petrovna interrupted suddenly, ""is there nothing
special you want to tell me?"""
"""No, nothing,"" said Dasha, after a moment's thought, and she glanced at
Varvara Petrovna with her light-coloured eyes."
"""Nothing on your soul, on your heart, or your conscience?"""
"""Nothing,"" Dasha repeated, quietly, but with a sort of sullen firmness."
"""I knew there wasn't!"
"Believe me, Darya, I shall never doubt you."
"Now
sit still and listen."
"In front of me, on that chair."
"I want to see the
whole of you."
That's right.
"Listen, do you want to be married?"""
"Dasha responded with a long, inquiring, but not greatly astonished look."
"""Stay, hold your tongue."
"In the first place there is a very great
difference in age, but of course you know better than anyone what
nonsense that is."
"You're a sensible girl, and there must be no mistakes
in your life."
"Besides, he's still a handsome man..."
"In short, Stepan
Trofimovitch, for whom you have always had such a respect."
"Well?"""
"Dasha looked at her still more inquiringly, and this time not simply
with surprise; she blushed perceptibly."
"""Stay, hold your tongue, don't be in a hurry!"
"Though you will have money
under my will, yet when I die, what will become of you, even if you have
money?"
"You'll be deceived and robbed of your money, you'll be lost in
fact."
But married to him you're the wife of a distinguished man.
"Look at
him on the other hand."
"Though I've provided for him, if I die what will
become of him?"
But I could trust him to you.
"Stay, I've not finished."
"He's frivolous, shilly-shally, cruel, egoistic, he has low habits."
"But
mind you think highly of him, in the first place because there are many
worse."
"I don't want to get you off my hands by marrying you to a rascal,
you don't imagine anything of that sort, do you?"
"And, above all, because
I ask you, you'll think highly of him,""--

She broke off suddenly and irritably."
"""Do you hear?"
"Why won't you say
something?"""
Dasha still listened and did not speak.
"""Stay, wait a little."
"He's an old woman, but you know, that's all the
better for you."
"Besides, he's a pathetic old woman."
"He doesn't deserve
to be loved by a woman at all, but he deserves to be loved for his
helplessness, and you must love him for his helplessness."
"You understand
me, don't you?"
"Do you understand me?"""
Dasha nodded her head affirmatively.
"""I knew you would."
I expected as much of you.
"He will love you because
he ought, he ought; he ought to adore you."""
"Varvara Petrovna almost
shrieked with peculiar exasperation."
"""Besides, he will be in love with
you without any ought about it."
I know him.
"And another thing, I shall
always be here."
You may be sure I shall always be here.
"He will complain
of you, he'll begin to say things against you behind your back, he'll
whisper things against you to any stray person he meets, he'll be for
ever whining and whining; he'll write you letters from one room to
another, two a day, but he won't be able to get on without you all the
same, and that's the chief thing."
Make him obey you.
"If you can't make
him you'll be a fool."
"He'll want to hang himself and threaten, to--don't
you believe it."
It's nothing but nonsense.
"Don't believe it; but still
keep a sharp look-out, you never can tell, and one day he may hang
himself."
It does happen with people like that.
"It's not through strength
of will but through weakness that people hang themselves, and so
never drive him to an extreme, that's the first rule in married life."
"Remember, too, that he's a poet."
"Listen, Dasha, there's no greater
happiness than self-sacrifice."
"And besides, you'll be giving me great
satisfaction and that's the chief thing."
"Don't think I've been talking
nonsense."
I understand what I'm saying.
"I'm an egoist, you be an egoist,
too."
Of course I'm not forcing you.
It's entirely for you to decide.
"As you say, so it shall be."
"Well, what's the good of sitting like this."
"Speak!"""
"""I don't mind, Varvara Petrovna, if I really must be married,"" said
Dasha firmly."
"""Must?"
"What are you hinting at?"""
"Varvara Petrovna looked sternly and
intently at her."
"Dasha was silent, picking at her embroidery canvas with her needle."
"""Though you're a clever girl, you're talking nonsense; though it is true
that I have certainly set my heart on marrying you, yet it's not because
it's necessary, but simply because the idea has occurred to me, and only
to Stepan Trofimovitch."
"If it had not been for Stepan Trofimovitch, I
should not have thought of marrying you yet, though you are twenty...."
"Well?"""
"""I'll do as you wish, Varvara Petrovna."""
"""Then you consent!"
"Stay, be quiet."
Why are you in such a hurry?
"I
haven't finished."
In my will I've left you fifteen thousand roubles.
"I'll give you that at once, on your wedding-day."
"You will give eight
thousand of it to him; that is, not to him but to me."
"He has a debt of
eight thousand."
"I'll pay it, but he must know that it is done with your
money."
You'll have seven thousand left in your hands.
"Never let him
touch a farthing of it."
Don't pay his debts ever.
"If once you pay them,
you'll never be free of them."
"Besides, I shall always be here."
"You
shall have twelve hundred roubles a year from me, with extras, fifteen
hundred, besides board and lodging, which shall be at my expense, just
as he has it now."
Only you must set up your own servants.
"Your yearly
allowance shall be paid to you all at once straight into your hands."
"But
be kind, and sometimes give him something, and let his friends come to
see him once a week, but if they come more often, turn them out."
"But
I shall be here, too."
"And if I die, your pension will go on till his
death, do you hear, till his death, for it's his pension, not yours."
"And besides the seven thousand you'll have now, which you ought to keep
untouched if you're not foolish, I'll leave you another eight thousand
in my will."
"And you'll get nothing more than that from me, it's right
that you should know it."
"Come, you consent, eh?"
"Will you say something
at last?"""
"""I have told you already, Varvara Petrovna."""
"""Remember that you're free to decide."
"As you like, so it shall be."""
"""Then, may I ask, Varvara Petrovna, has Stepan Trofimovitch said
anything yet?"""
"""No, he hasn't said anything, he doesn't know... but he will speak
directly."""
She jumped up at once and threw on a black shawl.
"Dasha flushed a little
again, and watched her with questioning eyes."
"Varvara Petrovna turned
suddenly to her with a face flaming with anger."
"""You're a fool!"""
She swooped down on her like a hawk.
"""An ungrateful
fool!"
What's in your mind?
"Can you imagine that I'd compromise you, in
any way, in the smallest degree."
"Why, he shall crawl on his knees to
ask you, he must be dying of happiness, that's how it shall be arranged."
"Why, you know that I'd never let you suffer."
"Or do you suppose he'll
take you for the sake of that eight thousand, and that I'm hurrying off
to sell you?"
"You're a fool, a fool!"
You're all ungrateful fools.
"Give me
my umbrella!"""
"And she flew off to walk by the wet brick pavements and the wooden
planks to Stepan Trofimovitch's."
"VII

It was true that she would never have let Dasha suffer; on the contrary,
she considered now that she was acting as her benefactress."
"The most
generous and legitimate indignation was glowing in her soul, when, as
she put on her shawl, she caught fixed upon her the embarrassed and
mistrustful eyes of her protégée."
"She had genuinely loved the girl from
her childhood upwards."
"Praskovya Ivanovna had with justice called Darya
Pavlovna her favourite."
"Long ago Varvara Petrovna had made up her mind
once for all that ""Darya's disposition was not like her brother's"" (not,
that is, like Ivan Shatov's), that she was quiet and gentle, and capable
of great self-sacrifice; that she was distinguished by a power of
devotion, unusual modesty, rare reasonableness, and, above all, by
gratitude."
"Till that time Dasha had, to all appearances, completely
justified her expectations."
"""In that life there will be no mistakes,"" said Varvara Petrovna when the
girl was only twelve years old, and as it was characteristic of her to
attach herself doggedly and passionately to any dream that fascinated
her, any new design, any idea that struck her as noble, she made up her
mind at once to educate Dasha as though she were her own daughter."
"She
at once set aside a sum of money for her, and sent for a governess, Miss
Criggs, who lived with them until the girl was sixteen, but she was
for some reason suddenly dismissed."
"Teachers came for her from the High
School, among them a real Frenchman, who taught Dasha French."
"He, too,
was suddenly dismissed, almost turned out of the house."
"A poor lady, a
widow of good family, taught her to play the piano."
"Yet her chief tutor
was Stepan Trofimovitch."
In reality he first discovered Dasha.
"He began teaching the quiet child
even before Varvara Petrovna had begun to think about her."
"I repeat
again, it was wonderful how children took to him."
"Lizaveta Nikolaevna
Tushin had been taught by him from the age of eight till eleven (Stepan
Trofimovitch took no fees, of course, for his lessons, and would not on
any account have taken payment from the Drozdovs)."
"But he fell in love
with the charming child and used to tell her poems of a sort about the
creation of the world, about the earth, and the history of humanity."
"His lectures about the primitive peoples and primitive man were more
interesting than the Arabian Nights."
"Liza, who was ecstatic over these
stories, used to mimic Stepan Trofimovitch very funnily at home."
"He
heard of this and once peeped in on her unawares."
"Liza, overcome
with confusion, flung herself into his arms and shed tears; Stepan
Trofimovitch wept too with delight."
"But Liza soon after went away, and
only Dasha was left."
"When Dasha began to have other teachers, Stepan
Trofimovitch gave up his lessons with her, and by degrees left off
noticing her."
Things went on like this for a long time.
"Once when she
was seventeen he was struck by her prettiness."
"It happened at Varvara
Petrovna's table."
"He began to talk to the young girl, was much pleased
with her answers, and ended by offering to give her a serious and
comprehensive course of lessons on the history of Russian literature."
"Varvara Petrovna approved, and thanked him for his excellent idea,
and Dasha was delighted."
"Stepan Trofimovitch proceeded to make special
preparations for the lectures, and at last they began."
"They began
with the most ancient period."
The first lecture went off enchantingly.
Varvara Petrovna was present.
"When Stepan Trofimovitch had finished, and
as he was going informed his pupil that the next time he would deal with
""The Story of the Expedition of Igor,"" Varvara Petrovna suddenly got up
and announced that there would be no more lessons."
"Stepan Trofimovitch
winced, but said nothing, and Dasha flushed crimson."
"It put a stop to
the scheme, however."
"This had happened just three years before Varvara
Petrovna's unexpected fancy."
Poor Stepan Trofimovitch was sitting alone free from all misgivings.
"Plunged in mournful reveries he had for some time been looking out of
the window to see whether any of his friends were coming."
"But nobody
would come."
It was drizzling.
"It was turning cold, he would have to have
the stove heated."
He sighed.
"Suddenly a terrible apparition flashed upon
his eyes:

Varvara Petrovna in such weather and at such an unexpected hour to see
him!"
And on foot!
"He was so astounded that he forgot to put on his
coat, and received her as he was, in his everlasting pink-wadded
dressing-jacket."
"_""Ma bonne amie!"
"""_ he cried faintly, to greet her."
"""You're alone; I'm
glad; I can't endure your friends."
How you do smoke!
"Heavens, what an
atmosphere!"
"You haven't finished your morning tea and it's nearly twelve
o'clock."
It's your idea of bliss--disorder!
You take pleasure in dirt.
What's that torn paper on the floor?
"Nastasya, Nastasya!"
"What is
your Nastasya about?"
"Open the window, the casement, the doors, fling
everything wide open."
And we'll go into the drawing-room.
"I've come to
you on a matter of importance."
"And you sweep up, my good woman, for once
in your life."""
"""They make such a muck!"""
"Nastasya whined in a voice of plaintive
exasperation."
"""Well, you must sweep, sweep it up fifteen times a day!"
"You've a
wretched drawing-room"" (when they had gone into the drawing-room)."
"""Shut
the door properly."
She'll be listening.
You must have it repapered.
Didn't I send a paperhanger to you with patterns?
"Why didn't you choose
one?"
"Sit down, and listen."
"Do sit down, I beg you."
Where are you off to?
Where are you off to?
"Where are you off to?"""
"""I'll be back directly,"" Stepan Trofimovitch cried from the next room."
"""Here I am again."""
"""Ah,--you've changed your coat."""
She scanned him mockingly.
"(He had
flung his coat on over the dressing-jacket.)"
"""Well, certainly that's
more suited to our subject."
"Do sit down, I entreat you."""
"She told him everything at once, abruptly and impressively."
"She hinted at
the eight thousand of which he stood in such terrible need."
"She told him
in detail of the dowry."
"Stepan Trofimovitch sat trembling, opening
his eyes wider and wider."
"He heard it all, but he could not realise it
clearly."
"He tried to speak, but his voice kept breaking."
"All he knew
was that everything would be as she said, that to protest and refuse to
agree would be useless, and that he was a married man irrevocably."
"_""Mais, ma bonne amie!_...for the third time, and at my age...and to
such a child."""
"He brought out at last, _""Mais, c'est une enfant!"
"""_

""A child who is twenty years old, thank God."
"Please don't roll your
eyes, I entreat you, you're not on the stage."
"You're very clever and
learned, but you know nothing at all about life."
"You will always want a
nurse to look after you."
"I shall die, and what will become of you?"
"She will be a good nurse to you; she's a modest girl, strong-willed,
reasonable; besides, I shall be here too, I shan't die directly."
"She's
fond of home, she's an angel of gentleness."
"This happy thought came to
me in Switzerland."
"Do you understand if I tell you myself that she is
an angel of gentleness!"""
she screamed with sudden fury.
"""Your house is
dirty, she will bring in order, cleanliness."
"Everything will shine like
a mirror."
"Good gracious, do you expect me to go on my knees to you with
such a treasure, to enumerate all the advantages, to court you!"
"Why, you
ought to be on your knees.... Oh, you shallow, shallow, faint-hearted
man!"""
"""But..."
"I'm an old man!"""
"""What do your fifty-three years matter!"
"Fifty is the middle of life,
not the end of it."
You are a handsome man and you know it yourself.
"You
know, too, what a respect she has for you."
"If I die, what will become of
her?"
"But married to you she'll be at peace, and I shall be at peace."
"You
have renown, a name, a loving heart."
"You receive a pension which I look
upon as an obligation."
"You will save her perhaps, you will save her!"
"In
any case you will be doing her an honour."
"You will form her for life,
you will develop her heart, you will direct her ideas."
"How many people
come to grief nowadays because their ideas are wrongly directed."
"By that
time your book will be ready, and you will at once set people talking
about you again."""
"""I am, in fact,"" he muttered, at once flattered by Varvara Petrovna's
adroit insinuations."
"""I was just preparing to sit down to my 'Tales from
Spanish History.'"""
"""Well, there you are."
"It's just come right."""
"""But... she?"
"Have you spoken to her?"""
"""Don't worry about her."
And there's no need for you to be inquisitive.
"Of course, you must ask her yourself, entreat her to do you the honour,
you understand?"
But don't be uneasy.
I shall be here.
"Besides, you love
her."""
Stepan Trofimovitch felt giddy.
The walls were going round.
"There was
one terrible idea underlying this to which he could not reconcile
himself."
"_""Excellente amie,""_ his voice quivered suddenly."
"""I could never have
conceived that you would make up your mind to give me in marriage to
another..."
"woman."""
"""You're not a girl, Stepan Trofimovitch."
"Only girls are given in
marriage."
"You are taking a wife,"" Varvara Petrovna hissed malignantly."
"_""Oui, j'ai pris un mot pour un autre."
Mais c'est égal.
"""_ He gazed at her
with a hopeless air."
"""I see that _c'est égal_,"" she muttered contemptuously through her teeth."
"""Good heavens!"
Why he's going to faint.
"Nastasya, Nastasya, water!"""
But water was not needed.
He came to himself.
"Varvara Petrovna took up
her umbrella."
"""I see it's no use talking to you now....""

_""Oui, oui, je suis incapable."
"""_

""But by to-morrow you'll have rested and thought it over."
Stay at home.
"If anything happens let me know, even if it's at night."
"Don't write
letters, I shan't read them."
"To-morrow I'll come again at this time
alone, for a final answer, and I trust it will be satisfactory."
"Try to
have nobody here and no untidiness, for the place isn't fit to be seen."
"Nastasya, Nastasya!"""
"The next day, of course, he consented, and, indeed, he could do nothing
else."
"There was one circumstance...


VIII

Stepan Trofimovitch's estate, as we used to call it (which consisted
of fifty souls, reckoning in the old fashion, and bordered on
Skvoreshniki), was not really his at all, but his first wife's, and
so belonged now to his son Pyotr Stepanovitch Verhovensky."
"Stepan
Trofimovitch was simply his trustee, and so, when the nestling was
full-fledged, he had given his father a formal authorisation to manage
the estate."
This transaction was a profitable one for the young man.
"He
received as much as a thousand roubles a year by way of revenue from the
estate, though under the new regime it could not have yielded more than
five hundred, and possibly not that."
"God knows how such an arrangement
had arisen."
"The whole sum, however, was sent the young man by Varvara
Petrovna, and Stepan Trofimovitch had nothing to do with a single rouble
of it."
"On the other hand, the whole revenue from the land remained in
his pocket, and he had, besides, completely ruined the estate, letting
it to a mercenary rogue, and without the knowledge of Varvara Petrovna
selling the timber which gave the estate its chief value."
"He had some
time before sold the woods bit by bit."
"It was worth at least
eight thousand, yet he had only received five thousand for it."
"But
he sometimes lost too much at the club, and was afraid to ask Varvara
Petrovna for the money."
"She clenched her teeth when she heard at last of
everything."
"And now, all at once, his son announced that he was
coming himself to sell his property for what he could get for it, and
commissioned his father to take steps promptly to arrange the sale."
"It
was clear that Stepan Trofimovitch, being a generous and disinterested
man, felt ashamed of his treatment of _ce cher enfant_ (whom he had seen
for the last time nine years before as a student in Petersburg)."
"The
estate might originally have been worth thirteen or fourteen thousand."
Now it was doubtful whether anyone would give five for it.
"No doubt
Stepan Trofimovitch was fully entitled by the terms of the trust to sell
the wood, and taking into account the incredibly large yearly revenue of
a thousand roubles which had been sent punctually for so many years,
he could have put up a good defence of his management."
"But Stepan
Trofimovitch was a generous man of exalted impulses."
"A wonderfully fine
inspiration occurred to his mind: when Petrusha returned, to lay on the
table before him the maximum price of fifteen thousand roubles without
a hint at the sums that had been sent him hitherto, and warmly and with
tears to press _ce cher fils_ to his heart, and so to make an end of all
accounts between them."
"He began cautiously and indirectly unfolding
this picture before Varvara Petrovna."
"He hinted that this would add a
peculiarly noble note to their friendship... to their ""idea."""
"This
would set the parents of the last generation--and people of the last
generation generally--in such a disinterested and magnanimous light in
comparison with the new frivolous and socialistic younger generation."
"He
said a great deal more, but Varvara Petrovna was obstinately silent."
"At
last she informed him airily that she was prepared to buy their estate,
and to pay for it the maximum price, that is, six or seven thousand
(though four would have been a fair price for it)."
"Of the remaining
eight thousand which had vanished with the woods she said not a word."
"This conversation took place a month before the match was proposed to
him."
"Stepan Trofimovitch was overwhelmed, and began to ponder."
"There
might in the past have been a hope that his son would not come,
after all--an outsider, that is to say, might have hoped so."
"Stepan
Trofimovitch as a father would have indignantly rejected the
insinuation that he could entertain such a hope."
"Anyway queer rumours
had hitherto been reaching us about Petrusha."
"To begin with, on
completing his studies at the university six years before, he had hung
about in Petersburg without getting work."
"Suddenly we got the news that
he had taken part in issuing some anonymous manifesto and that he
was implicated in the affair."
"Then he suddenly turned up abroad in
Switzerland at Geneva--he had escaped, very likely."
"""It's surprising to me,"" Stepan Trofimovitch commented, greatly
disconcerted."
"""Petrusha, _c'est une si pauvre tête!_ He's good,
noble-hearted, very sensitive, and I was so delighted with him in
Petersburg, comparing him with the young people of to-day."
"But _c'est un
pauvre sire, tout de même_.... And you know it all comes from that
same half-bakedness, that sentimentality."
"They are fascinated, not by
realism, but by the emotional ideal side of socialism, by the religious
note in it, so to say, by the poetry of it... second-hand, of course."
"And for me, for me, think what it means!"
"I have so many enemies here and
more still _there_, they'll put it down to the father's influence."
"Good
God!"
Petrusha a revolutionist!
"What times we live in!"""
"Very soon, however, Petrusha sent his exact address from Switzerland for
money to be sent him as usual; so he could not be exactly an exile."
"And now, after four years abroad, he was suddenly making his appearance
again in his own country, and announced that he would arrive shortly,
so there could be no charge against him."
"What was more, someone seemed
to be interested in him and protecting him."
"He wrote now from the south
of Russia, where he was busily engaged in some private but important
business."
"All this was capital, but where was his father to get that
other seven or eight thousand, to make up a suitable price for the
estate?"
"And what if there should be an outcry, and instead of that
imposing picture it should come to a lawsuit?"
"Something told Stepan
Trofimovitch that the sensitive Petrusha would not relinquish anything
that was to his interest."
"""Why is it--as I've noticed,"" Stepan
Trofimovitch whispered to me once, ""why is it that all these desperate
socialists and communists are at the same time such incredible
skinflints, so avaricious, so keen over property, and, in fact, the
more socialistic, the more extreme they are, the keener they are over
property... why is it?"
"Can that, too, come from sentimentalism?"""
"I
don't know whether there is any truth in this observation of Stepan
Trofimovitch's."
"I only know that Petrusha had somehow got wind of the
sale of the woods and the rest of it, and that Stepan Trofimovitch was
aware of the fact."
"I happened, too, to read some of Petrusha's letters
to his father."
"He wrote extremely rarely, once a year, or even less
often."
"Only recently, to inform him of his approaching visit, he had
sent two letters, one almost immediately after the other."
"All his
letters were short, dry, consisting only of instructions, and as the
father and son had, since their meeting in Petersburg, adopted the
fashionable ""thou"" and ""thee,"" Petrusha's letters had a striking
resemblance to the missives that used to be sent by landowners of the
old school from the town to their serfs whom they had left in charge of
their estates."
"And now suddenly this eight thousand which would solve
the difficulty would be wafted to him by Varvara Petrovna's proposition."
"And at the same time she made him distinctly feel that it never could
be wafted to him from anywhere else."
"Of course Stepan Trofimovitch
consented."
"He sent for me directly she had gone and shut himself up for the whole
day, admitting no one else."
"He cried, of course, talked well and talked
a great deal, contradicted himself continually, made a casual pun, and
was much pleased with it."
"Then he had a slight attack of his ""summer
cholera""--everything in fact followed the usual course."
"Then he brought
out the portrait of his German bride, now twenty years deceased, and
began plaintively appealing to her: ""Will you forgive me?"""
"In fact he
seemed somehow distracted."
Our grief led us to get a little drunk.
"He
soon fell into a sweet sleep, however."
"Next morning he tied his cravat
in masterly fashion, dressed with care, and went frequently to look at
himself in the glass."
"He sprinkled his handkerchief with scent, only a
slight dash of it, however, and as soon as he saw Varvara Petrovna out
of the window he hurriedly took another handkerchief and hid the scented
one under the pillow."
"""Excellent!"""
"Varvara Petrovna approved, on receiving his consent."
"""In
the first place you show a fine decision, and secondly you've listened
to the voice of reason, to which you generally pay so little heed in
your private affairs."
"There's no need of haste, however,"" she added,
scanning the knot of his white tie, ""for the present say nothing, and I
will say nothing."
"It will soon be your birthday; I will come to see you
with her."
"Give us tea in the evening, and please without wine or other
refreshments, but I'll arrange it all myself."
"Invite your friends, but
we'll make the list together."
"You can talk to her the day before, if
necessary."
"And at your party we won't exactly announce it, or make an
engagement of any sort, but only hint at it, and let people know without
any sort of ceremony."
"And then the wedding a fortnight later, as far
as possible without any fuss.... You two might even go away for a time
after the wedding, to Moscow, for instance."
"I'll go with you, too,
perhaps..."
"The chief thing is, keep quiet till then."""
Stepan Trofimovitch was surprised.
"He tried to falter that he could
not do like that, that he must talk it over with his bride."
"But Varvara
Petrovna flew at him in exasperation."
"""What for?"
"In the first place it may perhaps come to nothing."""
"""Come to nothing!"""
"muttered the bridegroom, utterly dumbfoundered."
"""Yes."
I'll see....
"But everything shall be as I've told you, and don't
be uneasy."
I'll prepare her myself.
There's really no need for you.
"Everything necessary shall be said and done, and there's no need for you
to meddle."
Why should you?
In what character?
"Don't come and don't write
letters."
"And not a sight or sound of you, I beg."
"I will be silent too."""
"She absolutely refused to explain herself, and went away, obviously
upset."
"Stepan Trofimovitch's excessive readiness evidently impressed
her."
Alas!
"he was utterly unable to grasp his position, and the question
had not yet presented itself to him from certain other points of view."
"On the contrary a new note was apparent in him, a sort of conquering and
jaunty air."
He swaggered.
"""I do like that!"""
"he exclaimed, standing before me, and flinging wide
his arms."
"""Did you hear?"
She wants to drive me to refusing at last.
"Why,
I may lose patience, too, and... refuse!"
"'Sit still, there's no need
for you to go to her.'"
"But after all, why should I be married?"
"Simply
because she's taken an absurd fancy into her heart."
"But I'm a serious
man, and I can refuse to submit to the idle whims of a giddy-woman!"
"I
have duties to my son and...and to myself!"
I'm making a sacrifice.
"Does
she realise that?"
"I have agreed, perhaps, because I am weary of life
and nothing matters to me."
"But she may exasperate me, and then it will
matter."
I shall resent it and refuse.
"_Et enfin, le ridicule_...what will
they say at the club?"
What will... what will... Laputin say?
"'Perhaps
nothing will come of it'--what a thing to say!"
That beats everything.
That's really... what is one to say to that?...
"_Je suis un forçat, un
Badinguet, un_ man pushed to the wall....""

And at the same time a sort of capricious complacency, something
frivolous and playful, could be seen in the midst of all these plaintive
exclamations."
In the evening we drank too much again.
CHAPTER III.
"THE SINS OF OTHERS


I

ABOUT A WEEK had passed, and the position had begun to grow more
complicated."
"I may mention in passing that I suffered a great deal during that
unhappy week, as I scarcely left the side of my affianced friend, in the
capacity of his most intimate confidant."
"What weighed upon him most
was the feeling of shame, though we saw no one all that week, and sat
indoors alone."
"But he was even ashamed before me, and so much so that
the more he confided to me the more vexed he was with me for it."
"He was
so morbidly apprehensive that he expected that every one knew about it
already, the whole town, and was afraid to show himself, not only at the
club, but even in his circle of friends."
"He positively would not go out
to take his constitutional till well after dusk, when it was quite dark."
"A week passed and he still did not know whether he were betrothed or
not, and could not find out for a fact, however much he tried."
"He had
not yet seen his future bride, and did not know whether she was to be
his bride or not; did not, in fact, know whether there was anything
serious in it at all."
"Varvara Petrovna, for some reason, resolutely
refused to admit him to her presence."
"In answer to one of his first
letters to her (and he wrote a great number of them) she begged him
plainly to spare her all communications with him for a time, because
she was very busy, and having a great deal of the utmost importance to
communicate to him she was waiting for a more free moment to do so, and
that she would let him know _in time_ when he could come to see her."
"She
declared she would send back his letters unopened, as they were ""simple
self-indulgence."""
I read that letter myself--he showed it me.
"Yet all this harshness and indefiniteness were nothing compared with
his chief anxiety."
"That anxiety tormented him to the utmost and without
ceasing."
He grew thin and dispirited through it.
"It was something of
which he was more ashamed than of anything else, and of which he would
not on any account speak, even to me; on the contrary, he lied on
occasion, and shuffled before me like a little boy; and at the same time
he sent for me himself every day, could not stay two hours without me,
needing me as much as air or water."
Such conduct rather wounded my vanity.
"I need hardly say that I had
long ago privately guessed this great secret of his, and saw through it
completely."
"It was my firmest conviction at the time that the revelation
of this secret, this chief anxiety of Stepan Trofimovitch's would not
have redounded to his credit, and, therefore, as I was still young, I
was rather indignant at the coarseness of his feelings and the ugliness
of some of his suspicions."
"In my warmth--and, I must confess, in my
weariness of being his confidant--I perhaps blamed him too much."
"I was
so cruel as to try and force him to confess it all to me himself, though
I did recognise that it might be difficult to confess some things."
"He,
too, saw through me; that is, he clearly perceived that I saw through
him, and that I was angry with him indeed, and he was angry with me
too for being angry with him and seeing through him."
"My irritation was
perhaps petty and stupid; but the unrelieved solitude of two friends
together is sometimes extremely prejudicial to true friendship."
"From a
certain point of view he had a very true understanding of some aspects
of his position, and defined it, indeed, very subtly on those points
about which he did not think it necessary to be secret."
"""Oh, how different she was then!"""
"he would sometimes say to me about
Varvara Petrovna."
"""How different she was in the old days when we used to
talk together.... Do you know that she could talk in those days!"
"Can
you believe that she had ideas in those days, original ideas!"
"Now,
everything has changed!"
She says all that's only old-fashioned twaddle.
"She despises the past.... Now she's like some shopman or cashier, she
has grown hard-hearted, and she's always cross....""

""Why is she cross now if you are carrying out her orders?"""
I answered.
He looked at me subtly.
"""_Cher ami_; if I had not agreed she would have been dreadfully angry,
dread-ful-ly!"
"But yet less than now that I have consented."""
"He was pleased with this saying of his, and we emptied a bottle between
us that evening."
"But that was only for a moment, next day he was worse
and more ill-humoured than ever."
"But what I was most vexed with him for was that he could not bring
himself to call on the Drozdovs, as he should have done on their
arrival, to renew the acquaintance of which, so we heard they were
themselves desirous, since they kept asking about him."
"It was a source
of daily distress to him."
"He talked of Lizaveta Nikolaevna with an
ecstasy which I was at a loss to understand."
"No doubt he remembered in
her the child whom he had once loved."
"But besides that, he imagined for
some unknown reason that he would at once find in her company a solace
for his present misery, and even the solution of his more serious
doubts."
"He expected to meet in Lizaveta Nikolaevna an extraordinary
being."
"And yet he did not go to see her though he meant to do so every
day."
"The worst of it was that I was desperately anxious to be presented
to her and to make her acquaintance, and I could look to no one but
Stepan Trofimovitch to effect this."
"I was frequently meeting her, in the
street of course, when she was out riding, wearing a riding-habit and
mounted on a fine horse, and accompanied by her cousin, so-called, a
handsome officer, the nephew of the late General Drozdov--and these
meetings made an extraordinary impression on me at the time."
"My
infatuation lasted only a moment, and I very soon afterwards recognised
the impossibility of my dreams myself--but though it was a fleeting
impression it was a very real one, and so it may well be imagined
how indignant I was at the time with my poor friend for keeping so
obstinately secluded."
"All the members of our circle had been officially informed from the
beginning that Stepan Trofimovitch would see nobody for a time, and
begged them to leave him quite alone."
"He insisted on sending round a
circular notice to this effect, though I tried to dissuade him."
"I
went round to every one at his request and told everybody that Varvara
Petrovna had given ""our old man"" (as we all used to call Stepan
Trofimovitch among ourselves) a special job, to arrange in order some
correspondence lasting over many years; that he had shut himself up to
do it and I was helping him."
"Liputin was the only one I did not have
time to visit, and I kept putting it off--to tell the real truth I was
afraid to go to him."
"I knew beforehand that he would not believe one
word of my story, that he would certainly imagine that there was some
secret at the bottom of it, which they were trying to hide from him
alone, and as soon as I left him he would set to work to make inquiries
and gossip all over the town."
"While I was picturing all this to myself
I happened to run across him in the street."
"It turned out that he had
heard all about it from our friends, whom I had only just informed."
"But,
strange to say, instead of being inquisitive and asking questions about
Stepan Trofimovitch, he interrupted me, when I began apologising for not
having come to him before, and at once passed to other subjects."
"It is
true that he had a great deal stored up to tell me."
"He was in a state
of great excitement, and was delighted to have got hold of me for a
listener."
"He began talking of the news of the town, of the arrival
of the governor's wife, ""with new topics of conversation,"" of an
opposition party already formed in the club, of how they were all in a
hubbub over the new ideas, and how charmingly this suited him, and so
on."
"He talked for a quarter of an hour and so amusingly that I could not
tear myself away."
"Though I could not endure him, yet I must admit he had
the gift of making one listen to him, especially when he was very angry
at something."
"This man was, in my opinion, a regular spy from his very
nature."
"At every moment he knew the very latest gossip and all the
trifling incidents of our town, especially the unpleasant ones, and it
was surprising to me how he took things to heart that were sometimes
absolutely no concern of his."
"It always seemed to me that the leading
feature of his character was envy."
"When I told Stepan Trofimovitch the
same evening of my meeting Liputin that morning and our conversation,
the latter to my amazement became greatly agitated, and asked me the
wild question: ""Does Liputin know or not?"""
"I began trying to prove that there was no possibility of his finding it
out so soon, and that there was nobody from whom he could hear it."
"But
Stepan Trofimovitch was not to be shaken."
"""Well, you may believe it or
not,"" he concluded unexpectedly at last, ""but I'm convinced that he not
only knows every detail of 'our' position, but that he knows something
else besides, something neither you nor I know yet, and perhaps never
shall, or shall only know when it's too late, when there's no turning
back!..."""
"I said nothing, but these words suggested a great deal."
"For five whole
days after that we did not say one word about Liputin; it was clear to
me that Stepan Trofimovitch greatly regretted having let his tongue run
away with him, and having revealed such suspicions before me."
"II

One morning, on the seventh or eighth day after Stepan Trofimovitch had
consented to become ""engaged,"" about eleven o'clock, when I was hurrying
as usual to my afflicted friend, I had an adventure on the way."
"I met Karmazinov, ""the great writer,"" as Liputin called him."
"I had read
Karmazinov from a child."
"His novels and tales were well known to the
past and even to the present generation."
"I revelled in them; they were
the great enjoyment of my childhood and youth."
"Afterwards I grew rather
less enthusiastic over his work."
"I did not care so much for the novels
with a purpose which he had been writing of late as for his first,
early works, which were so full of spontaneous poetry, and his latest
publications I had not liked at all."
"Speaking generally, if I may
venture to express my opinion on so delicate a subject, all these
talented gentlemen of the middling sort who are sometimes in their
lifetime accepted almost as geniuses, pass out of memory quite suddenly
and without a trace when they die, and what's more, it often happens
that even during their lifetime, as soon as a new generation grows up
and takes the place of the one in which they have flourished, they are
forgotten and neglected by every one in an incredibly short time."
"This
somehow happens among us quite suddenly, like the shifting of the scenes
on the stage."
"Oh, it's not at all the same as with Pushkin, Gogol,
Molière, Voltaire, all those great men who really had a new original
word to say!"
"It's true, too, that these talented gentlemen of the
middling sort in the decline of their venerable years usually write
themselves out in the most pitiful way, though they don't observe the
fact themselves."
"It happens not infrequently that a writer who has been
for a long time credited with extraordinary profundity and expected
to exercise a great and serious influence on the progress of society,
betrays in the end such poverty, such insipidity in his fundamental
ideas that no one regrets that he succeeded in writing himself out so
soon."
"But the old grey-beards don't notice this, and are angry."
"Their
vanity sometimes, especially towards the end of their career, reaches
proportions that may well provoke wonder."
"God knows what they begin
to take themselves for--for gods at least!"
"People used to say about
Karmazinov that his connections with aristocratic society and powerful
personages were dearer to him than his own soul, people used to say that
on meeting you he would be cordial, that he would fascinate and enchant
you with his open-heartedness, especially if you were of use to him in
some way, and if you came to him with some preliminary recommendation."
"But that before any stray prince, any stray countess, anyone that he
was afraid of, he would regard it as his sacred duty to forget your
existence with the most insulting carelessness, like a chip of wood,
like a fly, before you had even time to get out of his sight; he
seriously considered this the best and most aristocratic style."
"In spite
of the best of breeding and perfect knowledge of good manners he is,
they say, vain to such an hysterical pitch that he cannot conceal his
irritability as an author even in those circles of society where little
interest is taken in literature."
"If anyone were to surprise him by being
indifferent, he would be morbidly chagrined, and try to revenge himself."
"A year before, I had read an article of his in a review, written with
an immense affectation of naïve poetry, and psychology too."
"He described
the wreck of some steamer on the English coast, of which he had been
the witness, and how he had seen the drowning people saved, and the
dead bodies brought ashore."
"All this rather long and verbose article
was written solely with the object of self-display."
"One seemed to read
between the lines: ""Concentrate yourselves on me."
"Behold what I was like
at those moments."
"What are the sea, the storm, the rocks, the splinters
of wrecked ships to you?"
"I have described all that sufficiently to you
with my mighty pen."
"Why look at that drowned woman with the dead child
in her dead arms?"
"Look rather at me, see how I was unable to bear that
sight and turned away from it."
"Here I stood with my back to it; here
I was horrified and could not bring myself to look; I blinked my
eyes--isn't that interesting?"""
"When I told Stepan Trofimovitch my
opinion of Karmazinov's article he quite agreed with me."
"When rumours had reached us of late that Karmazinov was coming to the
neighbourhood I was, of course, very eager to see him, and, if possible,
to make his acquaintance."
"I knew that this might be done through Stepan
Trofimovitch, they had once been friends."
"And now I suddenly met him at
the cross-roads."
I knew him at once.
"He had been pointed out to me two
or three days before when he drove past with the governor's wife."
"He
was a short, stiff-looking old man, though not over fifty-five, with a
rather red little face, with thick grey locks of hair clustering under
his chimney-pot hat, and curling round his clean little pink ears."
"His clean little face was not altogether handsome with its thin, long,
crafty-looking lips, with its rather fleshy nose, and its sharp, shrewd
little eyes."
"He was dressed somewhat shabbily in a sort of cape such as
would be worn in Switzerland or North Italy at that time of year."
"But,
at any rate, all the minor details of his costume, the little studs,
and collar, the buttons, the tortoise-shell lorgnette on a narrow black
ribbon, the signet-ring, were all such as are worn by persons of the
most irreproachable good form."
"I am certain that in summer he must have
worn light prunella shoes with mother-of-pearl buttons at the side."
"When we met he was standing still at the turning and looking about him,
attentively."
"Noticing that I was looking at him with interest, he asked
me in a sugary, though rather shrill voice:

""Allow me to ask, which is my nearest way to Bykovy Street?"""
"""To Bykovy Street?"
"Oh, that's here, close by,"" I cried in great
excitement."
"""Straight on along this street and the second turning to the
left."""
"""Very much obliged to you."""
A curse on that minute!
"I fancy I was shy, and looked cringing."
"He
instantly noticed all that, and of course realised it all at once; that
is, realised that I knew who he was, that I had read him and revered
him from a child, and that I was shy and looked at him cringingly."
"He
smiled, nodded again, and walked on as I had directed him."
"I don't know
why I turned back to follow him; I don't know why I ran for ten paces
beside him."
He suddenly stood still again.
"""And could you tell me where is the nearest cab-stand?"""
"he shouted out
to me again."
It was a horrid shout!
A horrid voice!
"""A cab-stand?"
"The nearest cab-stand is... by the Cathedral; there are
always cabs standing there,"" and I almost turned to run for a cab for
him."
I almost believe that that was what he expected me to do.
"Of
course I checked myself at once, and stood still, but he had noticed
my movement and was still watching me with the same horrid smile."
"Then
something happened which I shall never forget."
"He suddenly dropped a tiny bag, which he was holding in his left
hand; though indeed it was not a bag, but rather a little box, or more
probably some part of a pocket-book, or to be more accurate a little
reticule, rather like an old-fashioned lady's reticule, though I really
don't know what it was."
I only know that I flew to pick it up.
"I am convinced that I did not really pick it up, but my first motion
was unmistakable."
"I could not conceal it, and, like a fool, I turned
crimson."
"The cunning fellow at once got all that could be got out of the
circumstance."
"""Don't trouble, I'll pick it up,"" he pronounced charmingly; that is,
when he was quite sure that I was not going to pick up the reticule, he
picked it up as though forestalling me, nodded once more, and went his
way, leaving me to look like a fool."
"It was as good as though I had
picked it up myself."
"For five minutes I considered myself utterly
disgraced forever, but as I reached Stepan Trofimovitch's house I
suddenly burst out laughing; the meeting struck me as so amusing that I
immediately resolved to entertain Stepan Trofimovitch with an account of
it, and even to act the whole scene to him."
"III

But this time to my surprise I found an extraordinary change in him."
"He
pounced on me with a sort of avidity, it is true, as soon as I went in,
and began listening to me, but with such a distracted air that at first
he evidently did not take in my words."
"But as soon as I pronounced the
name of Karmazinov he suddenly flew into a frenzy."
"""Don't speak of him!"
"Don't pronounce that name!"""
"he exclaimed, almost in
a fury."
"""Here, look, read it!"
"Read it!"""
"He opened the drawer and threw on the table three small sheets of paper,
covered with a hurried pencil scrawl, all from Varvara Petrovna."
"The
first letter was dated the day before yesterday, the second had come
yesterday, and the last that day, an hour before."
"Their contents were
quite trivial, and all referred to Karmazinov and betrayed the vain
and fussy uneasiness of Varvara Petrovna and her apprehension that
Karmazinov might forget to pay her a visit."
"Here is the first one dating
from two days before."
"(Probably there had been one also three days
before, and possibly another four days before as well.)"
"""If he deigns to visit you to-day, not a word about me, I beg."
"Not the
faintest hint."
"Don't speak of me, don't mention me.--V."
"S.""

The letter of the day before:

""If he decides to pay you a visit this morning, I think the most
dignified thing would be not to receive him."
"That's what I think about
it; I don't know what you think.--V."
"S.""

To-day's, the last:

""I feel sure that you're in a regular litter and clouds of tobacco
smoke."
I'm sending you Marya and Fomushka.
"They'll tidy you up in half
an hour."
"And don't hinder them, but go and sit in the kitchen while they
clear up."
I'm sending you a Bokhara rug and two china vases.
"I've long
been meaning to make you a present of them, and I'm sending you my
Teniers, too, for a time!"
"You can put the vases in the window and hang
the Teniers on the right under the portrait of Goethe; it will be more
conspicuous there and it's always light there in the morning."
"If he does
turn up at last, receive him with the utmost courtesy but try and talk
of trifling matters, of some intellectual subject, and behave as though
you had seen each other lately."
Not a word about me.
"Perhaps I may look
in on you in the evening.--V."
S.
"""P.S.--If he does not come to-day he won't come at all."""
I read and was amazed that he was in such excitement over such trifles.
"Looking at him inquiringly, I noticed that he had had time while I was
reading to change the everlasting white tie he always wore, for a red
one."
His hat and stick lay on the table.
"He was pale, and his hands were
positively trembling."
"""I don't care a hang about her anxieties,"" he cried frantically, in
response to my inquiring look."
"""_Je m'en fiche!_ She has the face to be
excited about Karmazinov, and she does not answer my letters."
"Here is
my unopened letter which she sent me back yesterday, here on the table
under the book, under _L'Homme qui rit_."
"What is it to me that she's
wearing herself out over Nikolay!"
"_Je m'en fiche, et je proclame ma
liberté!"
Au diable le Karmazinov!
"Au diable la Lembke!_ I've hidden the
vases in the entry, and the Teniers in the chest of drawers, and I have
demanded that she is to see me at once."
Do you hear.
I've insisted!
"I've sent her just such a scrap of paper, a pencil scrawl, unsealed, by
Nastasya, and I'm waiting."
"I want Darya Pavlovna to speak to me with
her own lips, before the face of Heaven, or at least before you."
"_Vous me
seconderez, n'est-ce pas, comme ami et témoin._ I don't want to have
to blush, to lie, I don't want secrets, I won't have secrets in this
matter."
"Let them confess everything to me openly, frankly, honourably
and then... then perhaps I may surprise the whole generation by my
magnanimity.... Am I a scoundrel or not, my dear sir?"""
"he concluded
suddenly, looking menacingly at me, as though I'd considered him a
scoundrel."
I offered him a sip of water; I had never seen him like this before.
"All
the while he was talking he kept running from one end of the room to
the other, but he suddenly stood still before me in an extraordinary
attitude."
"""Can you suppose,"" he began again with hysterical haughtiness, looking
me up and down, ""can you imagine that I, Stepan Verhovensky, cannot find
in myself the moral strength to take my bag--my beggar's bag--and laying
it on my feeble shoulders to go out at the gate and vanish forever,
when honour and the great principle of independence demand it!"
"It's
not the first time that Stepan Verhovensky has had to repel despotism by
moral force, even though it be the despotism of a crazy woman, that
is, the most cruel and insulting despotism which can exist on earth,
although you have, I fancy, forgotten yourself so much as to laugh at
my phrase, my dear sir!"
"Oh, you don't believe that I can find the moral
strength in myself to end my life as a tutor in a merchant's family, or
to die of hunger in a ditch!"
"Answer me, answer at once; do you believe
it, or don't you believe it?"""
But I was purposely silent.
"I even affected to hesitate to wound him by
answering in the negative, but to be unable to answer affirmatively."
"In
all this nervous excitement of his there was something which really did
offend me, and not personally, oh, no!"
But...
I will explain later on.
He positively turned pale.
"""Perhaps you are bored with me, G----v (this is my surname), and you
would like... not to come and see me at all?"""
"he said in that tone of
pale composure which usually precedes some extraordinary outburst."
"I
jumped up in alarm."
"At that moment Nastasya came in, and, without a
word, handed Stepan Trofimovitch a piece of paper, on which something
was written in pencil."
He glanced at it and flung it to me.
"On the
paper, in Varvara Petrovna's hand three words were written: ""Stay at
home."""
"Stepan Trofimovitch snatched up his hat and stick in silence and went
quickly out of the room."
Mechanically I followed him.
"Suddenly voices
and sounds of rapid footsteps were heard in the passage."
"He stood still,
as though thunder-struck."
"""It's Liputin; I am lost!"""
"he whispered, clutching at my arm."
At the same instant Liputin walked into the room.
"IV

Why he should be lost owing to Liputin I did not know, and indeed I
did not attach much significance to the words; I put it all down to his
nerves."
"His terror, however, was remarkable, and I made up my mind to
keep a careful watch on him."
"The very appearance of Liputin as he came in assured us that he had on
this occasion a special right to come in, in spite of the prohibition."
"He brought with him an unknown gentleman, who must have been a new
arrival in the town."
"In reply to the senseless stare of my petrified
friend, he called out immediately in a loud voice:

""I'm bringing you a visitor, a special one!"
"I make bold to intrude on
your solitude."
"Mr. Kirillov, a very distinguished civil engineer."
"And
what's more he knows your son, the much esteemed Pyotr Stepanovitch,
very intimately; and he has a message from him."
"He's only just arrived."""
"""The message is your own addition,"" the visitor observed curtly."
"""There's no message at all."
But I certainly do know Verhovensky.
"I left
him in the X. province, ten days ahead of us."""
"Stepan Trofimovitch mechanically offered his hand and motioned him to
sit down."
"He looked at me, he looked at Liputin, and then as though
suddenly recollecting himself sat down himself, though he still kept his
hat and stick in his hands without being aware of it."
"""Bah, but you were going out yourself!"
"I was told that you were quite
knocked up with work."""
"""Yes, I'm ill, and you see, I meant to go for a walk, I..."" Stepan
Trofimovitch checked himself, quickly flung his hat and stick on the
sofa and--turned crimson."
"Meantime, I was hurriedly examining the visitor."
"He was a young man,
about twenty-seven, decently dressed, well made, slender and dark, with
a pale, rather muddy-coloured face and black lustreless eyes."
"He seemed
rather thoughtful and absent-minded, spoke jerkily and ungrammatically,
transposing words in rather a strange way, and getting muddled if he
attempted a sentence of any length."
"Liputin was perfectly aware of
Stepan Trofimovitch's alarm, and was obviously pleased at it."
"He sat
down in a wicker chair which he dragged almost into the middle of the
room, so as to be at an equal distance between his host and the visitor,
who had installed themselves on sofas on opposite sides of the room."
"His
sharp eyes darted inquisitively from one corner of the room to another."
"""It's.... a long while since I've seen Petrusha.... You met abroad?"""
Stepan Trofimovitch managed to mutter to the visitor.
"""Both here and abroad."""
"""Alexey Nilitch has only just returned himself after living four years
abroad,"" put in Liputin."
"""He has been travelling to perfect himself in
his speciality and has come to us because he has good reasons to expect
a job on the building of our railway bridge, and he's now waiting for an
answer about it."
"He knows the Drozdovs and Lizaveta Nikolaevna, through
Pyotr Stepanovitch."""
"The engineer sat, as it were, with a ruffled air, and listened with
awkward impatience."
It seemed to me that he was angry about something.
"""He knows Nikolay Vsyevolodovitch too."""
"""Do you know Nikolay Vsyevolodovitch?"""
inquired Stepan Trofimovitch.
"""I know him too."""
"""It's... it's a very long time since I've seen Petrusha, and..."
"I feel
I have so little right to call myself a father... _c'est le mot;_ I... how
did you leave him?"""
"""Oh, yes, I left him... he comes himself,"" replied Mr. Kirillov, in
haste to be rid of the question again."
He certainly was angry.
"""He's coming!"
"At last I... you see, it's very long since I've seen
Petrusha!"""
Stepan Trofimovitch could not get away from this phrase.
"""Now
I expect my poor boy to whom... to whom I have been so much to blame!"
"That is, I mean to say, when I left him in Petersburg, I... in short, I
looked on him as a nonentity, _quelque chose dans ce genre._ He was a very
nervous boy, you know, emotional, and... very timid."
"When he said his
prayers going to bed he used to bow down to the ground, and make the
sign of the cross on his pillow that he might not die in the night....
_Je m'en souviens."
"Enfin,_ no artistic feeling whatever, not a sign of
anything higher, of anything fundamental, no embryo of a future
ideal..._c'était comme un petit idiot,_ but I'm afraid I am incoherent;
excuse me... you came upon me...""

""You say seriously that he crossed his pillow?"""
"the engineer asked
suddenly with marked curiosity."
"""Yes, he used to...""

""All right."
I just asked.
"Go on."""
Stepan Trofimovitch looked interrogatively at Liputin.
"""I'm very grateful to you for your visit."
"But I must confess I'm...
not in a condition... just now..."
"But allow me to ask where you are
lodging."""
"""At Filipov's, in Bogoyavlensky Street."""
"""Ach, that's where Shatov lives,"" I observed involuntarily."
"""Just so, in the very same house,"" cried Liputin, ""only Shatov lodges
above, in the attic, while he's down below, at Captain Lebyadkin's."
"He
knows Shatov too, and he knows Shatov's wife."
"He was very intimate with
her, abroad."""
"""_Comment!_ Do you really know anything about that unhappy marriage _de ce
pauvre ami_ and that woman,"" cried Stepan Trofimovitch, carried away
by sudden feeling."
"""You are the first man I've met who has known her
personally; and if only...""

""What nonsense!"""
"the engineer snapped out, flushing all over."
"""How you
add to things, Liputin!"
"I've not seen Shatov's wife; I've only once seen
her in the distance and not at all close...."
I know Shatov.
"Why do you
add things of all sorts?"""
"He turned round sharply on the sofa, clutched his hat, then laid it down
again, and settling himself down once more as before, fixed his angry
black eyes on Stepan Trofimovitch with a sort of defiance."
"I was at a
loss to understand such strange irritability."
"""Excuse me,"" Stepan Trofimovitch observed impressively."
"""I understand
that it may be a very delicate subject....""

""No sort of delicate subject in it, and indeed it's shameful, and I
didn't shout at you that it's nonsense, but at Liputin, because he adds
things."
Excuse me if you took it to yourself.
"I know Shatov, but I don't
know his wife at all..."
"I don't know her at all!"""
"""I understand."
I understand.
"And if I insisted, it's only because I'm
very fond of our poor friend, _notre irascible ami_, and have always
taken an interest in him...."
"In my opinion that man changed his former,
possibly over-youthful but yet sound ideas, too abruptly."
"And now he
says all sorts of things about _notre Sainte Russie_ to such a degree that
I've long explained this upheaval in his whole constitution, I can only
call it that, to some violent shock in his family life, and, in fact, to
his unsuccessful marriage."
"I, who know my poor Russia like the fingers
on my hand, and have devoted my whole life to the Russian people, I can
assure you that he does not know the Russian people, and what's more...""

""I don't know the Russian people at all, either, and I haven't time to
study them,"" the engineer snapped out again, and again he turned sharply
on the sofa."
"Stepan Trofimovitch was pulled up in the middle of his
speech."
"""He is studying them, he is studying them,"" interposed Liputin."
"""He
has already begun the study of them, and is writing a very interesting
article dealing with the causes of the increase of suicide in Russia,
and, generally speaking, the causes that lead to the increase or
decrease of suicide in society."
"He has reached amazing results."""
The engineer became dreadfully excited.
"""You have no right at all,"" he
muttered wrathfully."
"""I'm not writing an article."
"I'm not going to do
silly things."
"I asked you confidentially, quite by chance."
"There's
no article at all."
"I'm not publishing, and you haven't the right...""
Liputin was obviously enjoying himself."
"""I beg your pardon, perhaps I made a mistake in calling your literary
work an article."
"He is only collecting observations, and the essence of
the question, or, so to say, its moral aspect he is not touching at all."
"And, indeed, he rejects morality itself altogether, and holds with the
last new principle of general destruction for the sake of ultimate
good."
"He demands already more than a hundred million heads for the
establishment of common sense in Europe; many more than they demanded at
the last Peace Congress."
"Alexey Nilitch goes further than anyone in that
sense."""
The engineer listened with a pale and contemptuous smile.
"For
half a minute every one was silent."
"""All this is stupid, Liputin,"" Mr. Kirillov observed at last, with a
certain dignity."
"""If I by chance had said some things to you, and you
caught them up again, as you like."
"But you have no right, for I never
speak to anyone."
I scorn to talk....
"If one has a conviction then it's
clear to me...."
But you're doing foolishly.
"I don't argue about things
when everything's settled."
I can't bear arguing.
"I never want to
argue....""

""And perhaps you are very wise,"" Stepan Trofimovitch could not resist
saying."
"""I apologise to you, but I am not angry with anyone here,"" the visitor
went on, speaking hotly and rapidly."
"""I have seen few people for four
years."
"For four years I have talked little and have tried to see no one,
for my own objects which do not concern anyone else, for four years."
Liputin found this out and is laughing.
I understand and don't mind.
"I'm
not ready to take offence, only annoyed at his liberty."
"And if I don't
explain my ideas to you,"" he concluded unexpectedly, scanning us all
with resolute eyes, ""it's not at all that I'm afraid of your giving
information to the government; that's not so; please do not imagine
nonsense of that sort."""
No one made any reply to these words.
We only looked at each other.
"Even
Liputin forgot to snigger."
"""Gentlemen, I'm very sorry""--Stepan Trofimovitch got up resolutely from
the sofa--""but I feel ill and upset."
"Excuse me."""
"""Ach, that's for us to go."""
"Mr. Kirillov started, snatching up his cap."
"""It's a good thing you told us."
"I'm so forgetful."""
"He rose, and with a good-natured air went up to Stepan Trofimovitch,
holding out his hand."
"""I'm sorry you're not well, and I came."""
"""I wish you every success among us,"" answered Stepan Trofimovitch,
shaking hands with him heartily and without haste."
"""I understand that,
if as you say you have lived so long abroad, cutting yourself off
from people for objects of your own and forgetting Russia, you must
inevitably look with wonder on us who are Russians to the backbone, and
we must feel the same about you."
"_Mais cela passera._ I'm only puzzled at
one thing: you want to build our bridge and at the same time you declare
that you hold with the principle of universal destruction."
"They won't
let you build our bridge."""
"""What!"
What's that you said?
"Ach, I say!"""
"Kirillov cried, much struck,
and he suddenly broke into the most frank and good-humoured laughter."
"For a moment his face took a quite childlike expression, which I thought
suited him particularly."
"Liputin rubbed his hand with delight at Stepan
Trofimovitch's witty remark."
"I kept wondering to myself why Stepan
Trofimovitch was so frightened of Liputin, and why he had cried out ""I
am lost"" when he heard him coming."
"V

We were all standing in the doorway."
"It was the moment when hosts and
guests hurriedly exchange the last and most cordial words, and then
part to their mutual gratification."
"""The reason he's so cross to-day,"" Liputin dropped all at once, as it
were casually, when he was just going out of the room, ""is because he
had a disturbance to-day with Captain Lebyadkin over his sister."
"Captain
Lebyadkin thrashes that precious sister of his, the mad girl, every day
with a whip, a real Cossack whip, every morning and evening."
"So Alexey
Nilitch has positively taken the lodge so as not to be present."
"Well,
good-bye."""
"""A sister?"
An invalid?
"With a whip?"""
"Stepan Trofimovitch cried out, as
though he had suddenly been lashed with a whip himself."
"""What sister?"
"What Lebyadkin?"""
All his former terror came back in an instant.
"""Lebyadkin!"
"Oh, that's the retired captain; he used only to call himself
a lieutenant before....""

""Oh, what is his rank to me?"
What sister?
Good heavens!...
"You say
Lebyadkin?"
"But there used to be a Lebyadkin here....""

""That's the very man."
"'Our' Lebyadkin, at Virginsky's, you remember?"""
"""But he was caught with forged papers?"""
"""Well, now he's come back."
"He's been here almost three weeks and under
the most peculiar circumstances."""
"""Why, but he's a scoundrel?"""
"""As though no one could be a scoundrel among us,"" Liputin grinned
suddenly, his knavish little eyes seeming to peer into Stepan
Trofimovitch's soul."
"""Good heavens!"
"I didn't mean that at all... though I quite agree with
you about that, with you particularly."
"But what then, what then?"
"What
did you mean by that?"
"You certainly meant something by that."""
"""Why, it's all so trivial...."
"This captain to all appearances went away
from us at that time; not because of the forged papers, but simply to
look for his sister, who was in hiding from him somewhere, it seems;
well, and now he's brought her and that's the whole story."
"Why do you
seem frightened, Stepan Trofimovitch?"
"I only tell this from his drunken
chatter though, he doesn't speak of it himself when he's sober."
"He's an
irritable man, and, so to speak, æsthetic in a military style; only he
has bad taste."
And this sister is lame as well as mad.
"She seems to
have been seduced by someone, and Mr. Lebyadkin has, it seems, for many
years received a yearly grant from the seducer by way of compensation
for the wound to his honour, so it would seem at least from his chatter,
though I believe it's only drunken talk."
It's simply his brag.
"Besides,
that sort of thing is done much cheaper."
"But that he has a sum of money
is perfectly certain."
"Ten days ago he was walking barefoot, and now I've
seen hundreds in his hands."
"His sister has fits of some sort every day,
she shrieks and he 'keeps her in order' with the whip."
"You must inspire
a woman with respect, he says."
"What I can't understand is how Shatov
goes on living above him."
"Alexey Nilitch has only been three days with
them."
"They were acquainted in Petersburg, and now he's taken the lodge
to get away from the disturbance."""
"""Is this all true?"""
"said Stepan Trofimovitch, addressing the engineer."
"""You do gossip a lot, Liputin,"" the latter muttered wrathfully."
"""Mysteries, secrets!"
"Where have all these mysteries and secrets among us
sprung from?"""
Stepan Trofimovitch could not refrain from exclaiming.
"The engineer frowned, flushed red, shrugged his shoulders and went out
of the room."
"""Alexey Nilitch positively snatched the whip out of his hand, broke it
and threw it out of the window, and they had a violent quarrel,"" added
Liputin."
"""Why are you chattering, Liputin; it's stupid."
"What for?"""
"Alexey Nilitch
turned again instantly."
"""Why be so modest and conceal the generous impulses of one's soul; that
is, of your soul?"
"I'm not speaking of my own."""
"""How stupid it is... and quite unnecessary."
"Lebyadkin's stupid and quite
worthless--and no use to the cause, and... utterly mischievous."
"Why do
you keep babbling all sorts of things?"
"I'm going."""
"""Oh, what a pity!"""
"cried Liputin with a candid smile, ""or I'd have
amused you with another little story, Stepan Trofimovitch."
"I came,
indeed, on purpose to tell you, though I dare say you've heard it
already."
"Well, till another time, Alexey Nilitch is in such a hurry."
Good-bye for the present.
The story concerns Varvara Petrovna.
"She
amused me the day before yesterday; she sent for me on purpose."
"It's
simply killing."
"Good-bye."""
But at this Stepan Trofimovitch absolutely would not let him go.
"He
seized him by the shoulders, turned him sharply back into the room, and
sat him down in a chair."
Liputin was positively scared.
"""Why, to be sure,"" he began, looking warily at Stepan Trofimovitch from
his chair, ""she suddenly sent for me and asked me 'confidentially' my
private opinion, whether Nikolay Vsyevolodovitch is mad or in his right
mind."
"Isn't that astonishing?"""
"""You're out of your mind!"""
"muttered Stepan Trofimovitch, and suddenly,
as though he were beside himself: ""Liputin, you know perfectly well that
you only came here to tell me something insulting of that sort and...
something worse!"""
"In a flash, I recalled his conjecture that Liputin knew not only more
than we did about our affair, but something else which we should never
know."
"""Upon my word, Stepan Trofimovitch,"" muttered Liputin, seeming greatly
alarmed, ""upon my word...""

""Hold your tongue and begin!"
"I beg you, Mr. Kirillov, to come back too,
and be present."
I earnestly beg you!
"Sit down, and you, Liputin, begin
directly, simply and without any excuses."""
"""If I had only known it would upset you so much I wouldn't have begun at
all."
"And of course I thought you knew all about it from Varvara Petrovna
herself."""
"""You didn't think that at all."
"Begin, begin, I tell you."""
"""Only do me the favour to sit down yourself, or how can I sit here
when you are running about before me in such excitement."
"I can't speak
coherently."""
"Stepan Trofimovitch restrained himself and sank impressively into an
easy chair."
The engineer stared gloomily at the floor.
"Liputin looked at
them with intense enjoyment,

""How am I to begin?..."
"I'm too overwhelmed....""


VI

""The day before yesterday a servant was suddenly sent to me: 'You are
asked to call at twelve o'clock,' said he."
Can you fancy such a thing?
"I
threw aside my work, and precisely at midday yesterday I was ringing at
the bell."
"I was let into the drawing room; I waited a minute--she came
in; she made me sit down and sat down herself, opposite."
"I sat down, and
I couldn't believe it; you know how she has always treated me."
"She
began at once without beating about the bush, you know her way."
"'You
remember,' she said, 'that four years ago when Nikolay Vsyevolodovitch
was ill he did some strange things which made all the town wonder
till the position was explained."
"One of those actions concerned you
personally."
"When Nikolay Vsyevolodovitch recovered he went at my request
to call on you."
"I know that he talked to you several times before, too."
"Tell me openly and candidly what you... (she faltered a little at this
point) what you thought of Nikolay Vsyevolodovitch then... what was your
view of him altogether... what idea you were able to form of him at that
time... and still have?'"
"""Here she was completely confused, so that she paused for a whole
minute, and suddenly flushed."
I was alarmed.
"She began again--touchingly
is not quite the word, it's not applicable to her--but in a very
impressive tone:

""'I want you,' she said, 'to understand me clearly and without mistake."
"I've sent for you now because I look upon you as a keen-sighted and
quick-witted man, qualified to make accurate observations.'"
"(What
compliments!)"
"'You'll understand too,' she said, 'that I am a mother
appealing to you.... Nikolay Vsyevolodovitch has suffered some
calamities and has passed through many changes of fortune in his life."
"All that,' she said, 'might well have affected the state of his mind."
"I'm not speaking of madness, of course,' she said, 'that's quite out
of the question!'"
(This was uttered proudly and resolutely.)
"'But there
might be something strange, something peculiar, some turn of thought, a
tendency to some particular way of looking at things.'"
"(Those were her
exact words, and I admired, Stepan Trofimovitch, the exactness with
which Varvara Petrovna can put things."
"She's a lady of superior
intellect!)"
"'I have noticed in him, anyway,' she said, 'a perpetual
restlessness and a tendency to peculiar impulses."
"But I am a mother
and you are an impartial spectator, and therefore qualified with your
intelligence to form a more impartial opinion."
"I implore you, in fact'
(yes, that word, 'implore' was uttered!"
"), 'to tell me the whole truth,
without mincing matters."
"And if you will give me your word never to
forget that I have spoken to you in confidence, you may reckon upon my
always being ready to seize every opportunity in the future to show my
gratitude.'"
"Well, what do you say to that?"""
"""You have... so amazed me..."" faltered Stepan Trofimovitch, ""that I
don't believe you."""
"""Yes, observe, observe,"" cried Liputin, as though he had not heard
Stepan Trofimovitch, ""observe what must be her agitation and uneasiness
if she stoops from her grandeur to appeal to a man like me, and even
condescends to beg me to keep it secret."
What do you call that?
"Hasn't she received some news of Nikolay Vsyevolodovitch, something
unexpected?"""
"""I don't know... of news of any sort..."
"I haven't seen her for some
days, but... but I must say..."" lisped Stepan Trofimovitch, evidently
hardly able to think clearly, ""but I must say, Liputin, that if it
was said to you in confidence, and here you're telling it before every
one...""

""Absolutely in confidence!"
But God strike me dead if I...
"But as for
telling it here... what does it matter?"
"Are we strangers, even Alexey
Nilitch?"""
"""I don't share that attitude."
"No doubt we three here will keep the
secret, but I'm afraid of the fourth, you, and wouldn't trust you in
anything....""

""What do you mean by that?"
"Why it's more to my interest than anyone's,
seeing I was promised eternal gratitude!"
"What I wanted was to point
out in this connection one extremely strange incident, rather to
say, psychological than simply strange."
"Yesterday evening, under the
influence of my conversation with Varvara Petrovna--you can fancy
yourself what an impression it made on me--I approached Alexey Nilitch
with a discreet question: 'You knew Nikolay Vsyevolodovitch abroad,'
said I, 'and used to know him before in Petersburg too."
"What do you
think of his mind and his abilities?'"
said I.
"He answered laconically,
as his way is, that he was a man of subtle intellect and sound judgment."
"'And have you never noticed in the course of years,' said I, 'any
turn of ideas or peculiar way of looking at things, or any, so to say,
insanity?'"
"In fact, I repeated Varvara Petrovna's own question."
"And
would you believe it, Alexey Nilitch suddenly grew thoughtful, and
scowled, just as he's doing now."
"'Yes,' said he, 'I have sometimes
thought there was something strange.'"
"Take note, too, that if anything
could have seemed strange even to Alexey Nilitch, it must really have
been something, mustn't it?"""
"""Is that true?"""
"said Stepan Trofimovitch, turning to Alexey Nilitch."
"""I should prefer not to speak of it,"" answered Alexey Nilitch, suddenly
raising his head, and looking at him with flashing eyes."
"""I wish to
contest your right to do this, Liputin."
"You've no right to drag me into
this."
I did not give my whole opinion at all.
"Though I knew Nikolay
Stavrogin in Petersburg that was long ago, and though I've met him since
I know him very little."
"I beg you to leave me out and... All this is
something like scandal."""
Liputin threw up his hands with an air of oppressed innocence.
"""A scandal-monger!"
Why not say a spy while you're about it?
"It's all
very well for you, Alexey Nilitch, to criticise when you stand aloof
from everything."
"But you wouldn't believe it, Stepan Trofimovitch--take
Captain Lebyadkin, he is stupid enough, one may say... in fact, one's
ashamed to say how stupid he is; there is a Russian comparison, to
signify the degree of it; and do you know he considers himself injured
by Nikolay Vsyevolodovitch, though he is full of admiration for his wit."
"'I'm amazed,' said he, 'at that man."
He's a subtle serpent.'
"His own
words."
"And I said to him (still under the influence of my conversation,
and after I had spoken to Alexey Nilitch), 'What do you think, captain,
is your subtle serpent mad or not?'"
"Would you believe it, it was just as
if I'd given him a sudden lash from behind."
"He simply leapt up from his
seat."
"'Yes,' said he, '... yes, only that,' he said, 'cannot affect...'
'Affect what?'"
He didn't finish.
"Yes, and then he fell to thinking so
bitterly, thinking so much, that his drunkenness dropped off him."
"We
were sitting in Filipov's restaurant."
"And it wasn't till half an hour
later that he suddenly struck the table with his fist."
"'Yes,' said he,
'maybe he's mad, but that can't affect it....' Again he didn't say what
it couldn't affect."
"Of course I'm only giving you an extract of the
conversation, but one can understand the sense of it."
"You may ask whom
you like, they all have the same idea in their heads, though it never
entered anyone's head before."
"'Yes,' they say, 'he's mad; he's very
clever, but perhaps he's mad too.'"""
"Stepan Trofimovitch sat pondering, and thought intently."
"""And how does Lebyadkin know?"""
"""Do you mind inquiring about that of Alexey Nilitch, who has just called
me a spy?"
"I'm a spy, yet I don't know, but Alexey Nilitch knows all the
ins and outs of it, and holds his tongue."""
"""I know nothing about it, or hardly anything,"" answered the engineer
with the same irritation."
"""You make Lebyadkin drunk to find out."
"You
brought me here to find out and to make me say."
"And so you must be a
spy."""
"""I haven't made him drunk yet, and he's not worth the money either, with
all his secrets."
They are not worth that to me.
"I don't know what they
are to you."
"On the contrary, he is scattering the money, though twelve
days ago he begged fifteen kopecks of me, and it's he treats me to
champagne, not I him."
"But you've given me an idea, and if there should
be occasion I will make him drunk, just to get to the bottom of it and
maybe I shall find out... all your little secrets,"" Liputin snapped back
spitefully."
Stepan Trofimovitch looked in bewilderment at the two disputants.
"Both
were giving themselves away, and what's more, were not standing on
ceremony."
"The thought crossed my mind that Liputin had brought this
Alexey Nilitch to us with the simple object of drawing him into a
conversation through a third person for purposes of his own--his
favourite manoeuvre."
"""Alexey Nilitch knows Nikolay Vsyevolodovitch quite well,"" he went on,
irritably, ""only he conceals it."
"And as to your question about Captain
Lebyadkin, he made his acquaintance before any of us did, six years ago
in Petersburg, in that obscure, if one may so express it, epoch in the
life of Nikolay Vsyevolodovitch, before he had dreamed of rejoicing our
hearts by coming here."
"Our prince, one must conclude, surrounded himself
with rather a queer selection of acquaintances."
"It was at that time, it
seems, that he made acquaintance with this gentleman here."""
"""Take care, Liputin."
"I warn you, Nikolay Vsyevolodovitch meant to be
here soon himself, and he knows how to defend himself."""
"""Why warn me?"
"I am the first to cry out that he is a man of the most
subtle and refined intelligence, and I quite reassured Varvara Petrovna
yesterday on that score."
"'It's his character,' I said to her, 'that I
can't answer for.'"
"Lebyadkin said the same thing yesterday: 'A lot of
harm has come to me from his character,' he said."
"Stepan Trofimovitch,
it's all very well for you to cry out about slander and spying, and at
the very time observe that you wring it all out of me, and with such
immense curiosity too."
"Now, Varvara Petrovna went straight to the point
yesterday."
"'You have had a personal interest in the business,' she said,
'that's why I appeal to you.'"
I should say so!
"What need to look for
motives when I've swallowed a personal insult from his excellency before
the whole society of the place."
"I should think I have grounds to be
interested, not merely for the sake of gossip."
"He shakes hands with
you one day, and next day, for no earthly reason, he returns your
hospitality by slapping you on the cheeks in the face of all decent
society, if the fancy takes him, out of sheer wantonness."
"And what's
more, the fair sex is everything for them, these butterflies and
mettlesome cocks!"
"Grand gentlemen with little wings like the ancient
cupids, lady-killing Petchorins!"
"It's all very well for you, Stepan
Trofimovitch, a confirmed bachelor, to talk like that, stick up for his
excellency and call me a slanderer."
"But if you married a pretty young
wife--as you're still such a fine fellow--then I dare say you'd bolt
your door against our prince, and throw up barricades in your house!"
"Why, if only that Mademoiselle Lebyadkin, who is thrashed with a whip,
were not mad and bandy-legged, by Jove, I should fancy she was the
victim of the passions of our general, and that it was from him that
Captain Lebyadkin had suffered 'in his family dignity,' as he expresses
it himself."
"Only perhaps that is inconsistent with his refined taste,
though, indeed, even that's no hindrance to him."
"Every berry is worth
picking if only he's in the mood for it."
"You talk of slander, but I'm
not crying this aloud though the whole town is ringing with it; I only
listen and assent."
"That's not prohibited."""
"""The town's ringing with it?"
"What's the town ringing with?"""
"""That is, Captain Lebyadkin is shouting for all the town to hear, and
isn't that just the same as the market-place ringing with it?"
"How am I
to blame?"
"I interest myself in it only among friends, for, after all,
I consider myself among friends here."""
"He looked at us with an innocent
air."
"""Something's happened, only consider: they say his excellency has
sent three hundred roubles from Switzerland by a most honourable young
lady, and, so to say, modest orphan, whom I have the honour of knowing,
to be handed over to Captain Lebyadkin."
"And Lebyadkin, a little later,
was told as an absolute fact also by a very honourable and therefore
trustworthy person, I won't say whom, that not three hundred but a
thousand roubles had been sent!..."
"And so, Lebyadkin keeps crying out
'the young lady has grabbed seven hundred roubles belonging to me,' and
he's almost ready to call in the police; he threatens to, anyway, and
he's making an uproar all over the town."""
"""This is vile, vile of you!"""
"cried the engineer, leaping up suddenly
from his chair."
"""But I say, you are yourself the honourable person who brought word
to Lebyadkin from Nikolay Vsyevolodovitch that a thousand roubles were
sent, not three hundred."
"Why, the captain told me so himself when he was
drunk."""
"""It's... it's an unhappy misunderstanding."
"Some one's made a mistake and
it's led to..."
"It's nonsense, and it's base of you."""
"""But I'm ready to believe that it's nonsense, and I'm distressed at the
story, for, take it as you will, a girl of an honourable reputation
is implicated first over the seven hundred roubles, and secondly in
unmistakable intimacy with Nikolay Vsyevolodovitch."
"For how much does it
mean to his excellency to disgrace a girl of good character, or put to
shame another man's wife, like that incident with me?"
"If he comes across
a generous-hearted man he'll force him to cover the sins of others under
the shelter of his honourable name."
"That's just what I had to put up
with, I'm speaking of myself....""

""Be careful, Liputin."""
"Stepan Trofimovitch got up from his easy chair
and turned pale."
"""Don't believe it, don't believe it!"
"Somebody has made a mistake
and Lebyadkin's drunk..."" exclaimed the engineer in indescribable
excitement."
"""It will all be explained, but I can't.... And I think it's
low.... And that's enough, enough!"""
He ran out of the room.
"""What are you about?"
"Why, I'm going with you!"""
"cried Liputin, startled."
He jumped up and ran after Alexey Nilitch.
"VII

Stepan Trofimovitch stood a moment reflecting, looked at me as though he
did not see me, took up his hat and stick and walked quietly out of
the room."
"I followed him again, as before."
"As we went out of the gate,
noticing that I was accompanying him, he said:

""Oh yes, you may serve as a witness..._de l'accident."
"Vous
m'accompagnerez, n'est-ce pas?_""

""Stepan Trofimovitch, surely you're not going there again?"
"Think what
may come of it!"""
"With a pitiful and distracted smile, a smile of shame and utter despair,
and at the same time of a sort of strange ecstasy, he whispered to me,
standing still for an instant:

""I can't marry to cover 'another man's sins'!"""
These words were just what I was expecting.
"At last that fatal sentence
that he had kept hidden from me was uttered aloud, after a whole week of
shuffling and pretence."
I was positively enraged.
"""And you, Stepan Verhovensky, with your luminous mind, your kind heart,
can harbour such a dirty, such a low idea... and could before Liputin
came!"""
"He looked at me, made no answer and walked on in the same direction."
I did not want to be left behind.
"I wanted to give Varvara Petrovna my
version."
"I could have forgiven him if he had simply with his womanish
faint-heartedness believed Liputin, but now it was clear that he
had thought of it all himself long before, and that Liputin had only
confirmed his suspicions and poured oil on the flames."
"He had not
hesitated to suspect the girl from the very first day, before he had any
kind of grounds, even Liputin's words, to go upon."
"Varvara Petrovna's
despotic behaviour he had explained to himself as due to her haste
to cover up the aristocratic misdoings of her precious ""Nicolas"" by
marrying the girl to an honourable man!"
"I longed for him to be punished
for it."
"""_Oh, Dieu, qui est si grand et si bon!_ Oh, who will comfort me!"""
"he
exclaimed, halting suddenly again, after walking a hundred paces."
"""Come straight home and I'll make everything clear to you,"" I cried,
turning him by force towards home."
"""It's he!"
"Stepan Trofimovitch, it's you?"
"You?"""
"A fresh, joyous young
voice rang out like music behind us."
"We had seen nothing, but a lady on horseback suddenly made her
appearance beside us--Lizaveta Nikolaevna with her invariable companion."
She pulled up her horse.
"""Come here, come here quickly!"""
"she called to us, loudly and merrily."
"""It's twelve years since I've seen him, and I know him, while he.... Do
you really not know me?"""
"Stepan Trofimovitch clasped the hand held out to him and kissed it
reverently."
"He gazed at her as though he were praying and could not
utter a word."
"""He knows me, and is glad!"
"Mavriky Nikolaevitch, he's delighted to see
me!"
Why is it you haven't been to see us all this fortnight?
"Auntie
tried to persuade me you were ill and must not be disturbed; but I know
Auntie tells lies."
"I kept stamping and swearing at you, but I had made
up my mind, quite made up my mind, that you should come to me first,
that was why I didn't send to you."
"Heavens, why he hasn't changed a
bit!"""
"She scrutinised him, bending down from the saddle."
"""He's absurdly
unchanged."
"Oh, yes, he has wrinkles, a lot of wrinkles, round his eyes
and on his cheeks some grey hair, but his eyes are just the same."
"And
have I changed?"
Have I changed?
"Why don't you say something?"""
"I remembered at that moment the story that she had been almost ill when
she was taken away to Petersburg at eleven years old, and that she had
cried during her illness and asked for Stepan Trofimovitch."
"""You..."
"I..."" he faltered now in a voice breaking with joy."
"""I was just
crying out 'who will comfort me?'"
and I heard your voice.
"I look on it
as a miracle _et je commence à croire_."""
"""_En Dieu!"
"En Dieu qui est là-haut et qui est si grand et si bon!_ You
see, I know all your lectures by heart."
"Mavriky Nikolaevitch, what faith
he used to preach to me then, _en Dieu qui est si grand et si bon!_ And do
you remember your story of how Columbus discovered America, and they
all cried out, 'Land!"
land!'?
"My nurse Alyona Frolovna says I was
light-headed at night afterwards, and kept crying out 'land!"
land!'
in my sleep.
"And do you remember how you told me the story of Prince
Hamlet?"
"And do you remember how you described to me how the poor
emigrants were transported from Europe to America?"
"And it was all
untrue; I found out afterwards how they were transited."
"But what
beautiful fibs he used to tell me then, Mavriky Nikolaevitch!"
"They were
better than the truth."
"Why do you look at Mavriky Nikolaevitch like
that?"
"He is the best and finest man on the face of the globe and you must
like him just as you do me!"
"_Il fait tout ce que je veux._ But, dear Stepan
Trofimovitch, you must be unhappy again, since you cry out in the middle
of the street asking who will comfort you."
"Unhappy, aren't you?"
"Aren't
you?"""
"""Now I'm happy....""

""Aunt is horrid to you?"""
"she went on, without listening."
"""She's just the
same as ever, cross, unjust, and always our precious aunt!"
"And do
you remember how you threw yourself into my arms in the garden and I
comforted you and cried--don't be afraid of Mavriky Nikolaevitch; he has
known all about you, everything, for ever so long; you can weep on his
shoulder as long as you like, and he'll stand there as long as you like!"
...
"Lift up your hat, take it off altogether for a minute, lift up your
head, stand on tiptoe, I want to kiss you on the forehead as I kissed
you for the last time when we parted."
"Do you see that young lady's
admiring us out of the window?"
"Come closer, closer!"
Heavens!
"How grey he
is!"""
And bending over in the saddle she kissed him on the forehead.
"""Come, now to your home!"
I know where you live.
"I'll be with you
directly, in a minute."
"I'll make you the first visit, you stubborn man,
and then I must have you for a whole day at home."
"You can go and make
ready for me."""
And she galloped off with her cavalier.
We returned.
"Stepan Trofimovitch
sat down on the sofa and began to cry."
"_""Dieu, Dieu."
"""_ he exclaimed, _""enfin une minute de bonheur!"
"""_

Not more than ten minutes afterwards she reappeared according to her
promise, escorted by her Mavriky Nikolaevitch."
"_""Vous et le bonheur, vous arrivez en même temps!"
"""_ He got up to meet her."
"""Here's a nosegay for you; I rode just now to Madame Chevalier's, she
has flowers all the winter for name-days."
"Here's Mavriky Nikolaevitch,
please make friends."
"I wanted to bring you a cake instead of a nosegay,
but Mavriky Nikolaevitch declares that is not in the Russian spirit."""
"Mavriky Nikolaevitch was an artillery captain, a tall and handsome man
of thirty-three, irreproachably correct in appearance, with an imposing
and at first sight almost stern countenance, in spite of his wonderful
and delicate kindness which no one could fail to perceive almost the
first moment of making his acquaintance."
"He was taciturn, however,
seemed very self-possessed and made no efforts to gain friends."
"Many
of us said later that he was by no means clever; but this was not
altogether just."
I won't attempt to describe the beauty of Lizaveta Nikolaevna.
"The
whole town was talking of it, though some of our ladies and young girls
indignantly differed on the subject."
"There were some among them who
already detested her, and principally for her pride."
"The Drozdovs had
scarcely begun to pay calls, which mortified them, though the real
reason for the delay was Praskovya Ivanovna's invalid state."
"They
detested her in the second place because she was a relative of
the governor's wife, and thirdly because she rode out every day on
horseback."
"We had never had young ladies who rode on horseback before;
it was only natural that the appearance of Lizaveta Nikolaevna on
horseback and her neglect to pay calls was bound to offend local
society."
"Yet every one knew that riding was prescribed her by the
doctor's orders, and they talked sarcastically of her illness."
"She
really was ill. What struck me at first sight in her was her abnormal,
nervous, incessant restlessness."
"Alas, the poor girl was very unhappy,
and everything was explained later."
"To-day, recalling the past, I should
not say she was such a beauty as she seemed to me then."
"Perhaps she was
really not pretty at all."
"Tall, slim, but strong and supple, she struck
one by the irregularities of the lines of her face."
"Her eyes were set
somewhat like a Kalmuck's, slanting; she was pale and thin in the
face with high cheek-bones, but there was something in the face that
conquered and fascinated!"
"There was something powerful in the ardent
glance of her dark eyes."
"She always made her appearance ""like a
conquering heroine, and to spread her conquests."""
"She seemed proud and
at times even arrogant."
"I don't know whether she succeeded in being
kind, but I know that she wanted to, and made terrible efforts to force
herself to be a little kind."
"There were, no doubt, many fine impulses
and the very best elements in her character, but everything in her
seemed perpetually seeking its balance and unable to find it; everything
was in chaos, in agitation, in uneasiness."
"Perhaps the demands she made
upon herself were too severe, and she was never able to find in herself
the strength to satisfy them."
She sat on the sofa and looked round the room.
"""Why do I always begin to feel sad at such moments; explain that
mystery, you learned person?"
"I've been thinking all my life that
I should be goodness knows how pleased at seeing you and recalling
everything, and here I somehow don't feel pleased at all, although I do
love you.... Ach, heavens!"
He has my portrait on the wall!
Give it here.
I remember it!
"I remember it!"""
"An exquisite miniature in water-colour of Liza at twelve years old had
been sent nine years before to Stepan Trofimovitch from Petersburg by
the Drozdovs."
He had kept it hanging on his wall ever since.
"""Was I such a pretty child?"
"Can that really have been my face?"""
"She stood up, and with the portrait in her hand looked in the
looking-glass."
"""Make haste, take it!"""
"she cried, giving back the portrait."
"""Don't hang
it up now, afterwards."
"I don't want to look at it."""
She sat down on the sofa again.
"""One life is over and another is begun,
then that one is over--a third begins, and so on, endlessly."
"All the
ends are snipped off as it were with scissors."
"See what stale things I'm
telling you."
"Yet how much truth there is in them!"""
"She looked at me, smiling; she had glanced at me several times already,
but in his excitement Stepan Trofimovitch forgot that he had promised
to introduce me."
"""And why have you hung my portrait under those daggers?"
"And why have you
got so many daggers and sabres?"""
"He had as a fact hanging on the wall, I don't know why, two crossed
daggers and above them a genuine Circassian sabre."
"As she asked this
question she looked so directly at me that I wanted to answer, but
hesitated to speak."
"Stepan Trofimovitch grasped the position at last and
introduced me."
"""I know, I know,"" she said, ""I'm delighted to meet you."
"Mother has
heard a great deal about you, too."
"Let me introduce you to Mavriky
Nikolaevitch too, he's a splendid person."
"I had formed a funny notion of
you already."
"You're Stepan Trofimovitch's confidant, aren't you?"""
I turned rather red.
"""Ach, forgive me, please."
"I used quite the wrong word: not funny at all,
but only..."" She was confused and blushed."
"""Why be ashamed though at
your being a splendid person?"
"Well, it's time we were going, Mavriky
Nikolaevitch!"
"Stepan Trofimovitch, you must be with us in half an hour."
"Mercy, what a lot we shall talk!"
"Now I'm your confidante, and about
everything, _everything,_ you understand?"""
Stepan Trofimovitch was alarmed at once.
"""Oh, Mavriky Nikolaevitch knows everything, don't mind him!"""
"""What does he know?"""
"""Why, what do you mean?"""
she cried in astonishment.
"""Bah, why it's true
then that they're hiding it!"
I wouldn't believe it!
"And they're hiding
Dasha, too."
Aunt wouldn't let me go in to see Dasha to-day.
"She says
she's got a headache."""
"""But... but how did you find out?"""
"""My goodness, like every one else."
"That needs no cunning!"""
"""But does every one else...?"""
"""Why, of course."
"Mother, it's true, heard it first through Alyona
Frolovna, my nurse; your Nastasya ran round to tell her."
"You told
Nastasya, didn't you?"
"She says you told her yourself."""
"""I..."
"I did once speak,"" Stepan Trofimovitch faltered, crimsoning all
over, ""but..."
"I only hinted... _j'étais si nerveux et malade, et
puis_...""

She laughed."
"""And your confidant didn't happen to be at hand, and Nastasya turned up."
Well that was enough!
And the whole town's full of her cronies!
"Come, it
doesn't matter, let them know; it's all the better."
"Make haste and come
to us, we dine early.... Oh, I forgot,"" she added, sitting down again;
""listen, what sort of person is Shatov?"""
"""Shatov?"
"He's the brother of Darya Pavlovna."""
"""I know he's her brother!"
"What a person you are, really,"" she
interrupted impatiently."
"""I want to know what he's like; what sort of
man he is."""
"_""C'est un pense-creux d'ici."
"C'est le meilleur et le plus irascible
homme du monde."
"""_

""I've heard that he's rather queer."
But that wasn't what I meant.
"I've
heard that he knows three languages, one of them English, and can do
literary work."
In that case I've a lot of work for him.
"I want someone
to help me and the sooner the better."
Would he take the work or not?
"He's been recommended to me....""

""Oh, most certainly he will."
"_Et vous ferez un bienfait_....""

""I'm not doing it as a _bienfait_."
"I need someone to help me."""
"""I know Shatov pretty well,"" I said, ""and if you will trust me with a
message to him I'll go to him this minute."""
"""Tell him to come to me at twelve o'clock to-morrow morning."
Capital!
Thank you.
"Mavriky Nikolaevitch, are you ready?"""
They went away.
"I ran at once, of course, to Shatov."
"_""Mon ami!"
"""_ said Stepan Trofimovitch, overtaking me on the steps."
"""Be
sure to be at my lodging at ten or eleven o'clock when I come back."
"Oh,
I've acted very wrongly in my conduct to you and to every one."""
"VIII

I did not find Shatov at home."
"I ran round again, two hours later."
"He
was still out."
"At last, at eight o'clock I went to him again, meaning
to leave a note if I did not find him; again I failed to find him."
"His
lodging was shut up, and he lived alone without a servant of any sort."
"I did think of knocking at Captain Lebyadkin's down below to ask about
Shatov; but it was all shut up below, too, and there was no sound or
light as though the place were empty."
"I passed by Lebyadkin's door with
curiosity, remembering the stories I had heard that day."
"Finally, I made
up my mind to come very early next morning."
"To tell the truth I did not
put much confidence in the effect of a note."
"Shatov might take no notice
of it; he was so obstinate and shy."
"Cursing my want of success, I was
going out of the gate when all at once I stumbled on Mr. Kirillov."
He was going into the house and he recognised me first.
"As he began
questioning me of himself, I told him how things were, and that I had a
note."
"""Let us go in,"" said he, ""I will do everything."""
"I remembered that Liputin had told us he had taken the wooden lodge in
the yard that morning."
"In the lodge, which was too large for him, a deaf
old woman who waited upon him was living too."
"The owner of the house had
moved into a new house in another street, where he kept a restaurant,
and this old woman, a relation of his, I believe, was left behind to
look after everything in the old house."
"The rooms in the lodge were
fairly clean, though the wall-papers were dirty."
"In the one we went into
the furniture was of different sorts, picked up here and there, and all
utterly worthless."
"There were two card-tables, a chest of drawers made
of elder, a big deal table that must have come from some peasant hut
or kitchen, chairs and a sofa with trellis-work back and hard leather
cushions."
"In one corner there was an old-fashioned ikon, in front of
which the old woman had lighted a lamp before we came in, and on the
walls hung two dingy oil-paintings, one, a portrait of the Tsar Nikolas
I, painted apparently between 1820 and 1830; the other the portrait of
some bishop."
"Mr. Kirillov lighted a candle and took out of his trunk,
which stood not yet unpacked in a corner, an envelope, sealing-wax, and
a glass seal."
"""Seal your note and address the envelope."""
"I would have objected that this was unnecessary, but he insisted."
"When I
had addressed the envelope I took my cap."
"""I was thinking you'd have tea,"" he said."
"""I have bought tea."
"Will you?"""
I could not refuse.
"The old woman soon brought in the tea, that is, a
very large tea-pot of boiling water, a little tea-pot full of strong
tea, two large earthenware cups, coarsely decorated, a fancy loaf, and a
whole deep saucer of lump sugar."
"""I love tea at night,"" said he."
"""I walk much and drink it till daybreak."
"Abroad tea at night is inconvenient."""
"""You go to bed at daybreak?"""
"""Always; for a long while."
I eat little; always tea.
"Liputin's sly, but
impatient."""
"I was surprised at his wanting to talk; I made up my mind to take
advantage of the opportunity."
"""There were unpleasant misunderstandings
this morning,"" I observed."
He scowled.
"""That's foolishness; that's great nonsense."
"All this is nonsense because
Lebyadkin is drunk."
"I did not tell Liputin, but only explained the
nonsense, because he got it all wrong."
"Liputin has a great deal of
fantasy, he built up a mountain out of nonsense."
"I trusted Liputin
yesterday."""
"""And me to-day?"""
"I said, laughing."
"""But you see, you knew all about it already this morning; Liputin is
weak or impatient, or malicious or... he's envious."""
The last word struck me.
"""You've mentioned so many adjectives, however, that it would be strange
if one didn't describe him."""
"""Or all at once."""
"""Yes, and that's what Liputin really is--he's a chaos."
"He was lying this
morning when he said you were writing something, wasn't he?"
"""Why should he?"""
"he said, scowling again and staring at the floor."
"I apologised, and began assuring him that I was not inquisitive."
"He
flushed."
"""He told the truth; I am writing."
"Only that's no matter."""
We were silent for a minute.
"He suddenly smiled with the childlike smile
I had noticed that morning."
"""He invented that about heads himself out of a book, and told me first
himself, and understands badly."
"But I only seek the causes why men dare
not kill themselves; that's all."
"And it's all no matter."""
"""How do you mean they don't dare?"
"Are there so few suicides?"""
"""Very few."""
"""Do you really think so?"""
"He made no answer, got up, and began walking to and fro lost in thought."
"""What is it restrains people from suicide, do you think?"""
I asked.
"He looked at me absent-mindedly, as though trying to remember what we
were talking about."
"""I..."
"I don't know much yet.... Two prejudices restrain them, two
things; only two, one very little, the other very big."""
"""What is the little thing?"""
"""Pain."""
"""Pain?"
"Can that be of importance at such a moment?"""
"""Of the greatest."
"There are two sorts: those who kill themselves either
from great sorrow or from spite, or being mad, or no matter what...
they do it suddenly."
"They think little about the pain, but kill
themselves suddenly."
"But some do it from reason--they think a great
deal."""
"""Why, are there people who do it from reason?"""
"""Very many."
"If it were not for superstition there would be more, very
many, all."""
"""What, all?"""
He did not answer.
"""But aren't there means of dying without pain?"""
"""Imagine""--he stopped before me--""imagine a stone as big as a great
house; it hangs and you are under it; if it falls on you, on your head,
will it hurt you?"""
"""A stone as big as a house?"
"Of course it would be fearful."""
"""I speak not of the fear."
"Will it hurt?"""
"""A stone as big as a mountain, weighing millions of tons?"
"Of course it
wouldn't hurt."""
"""But really stand there and while it hangs you will fear very much that
it will hurt."
"The most learned man, the greatest doctor, all, all will
be very much frightened."
"Every one will know that it won't hurt, and
every one will be afraid that it will hurt."""
"""Well, and the second cause, the big one?"""
"""The other world!"""
"""You mean punishment?"""
"""That's no matter."
"The other world; only the other world."""
"""Are there no atheists, such as don't believe in the other world at
all?"""
Again he did not answer.
"""You judge from yourself, perhaps."""
"""Every one cannot judge except from himself,"" he said, reddening."
"""There
will be full freedom when it will be just the same to live or not to
live."
"That's the goal for all."""
"""The goal?"
"But perhaps no one will care to live then?"""
"""No one,"" he pronounced with decision."
"""Man fears death because he loves life."
"That's how I understand it,"" I
observed, ""and that's determined by nature."""
"""That's abject; and that's where the deception comes in."""
"His eyes
flashed."
"""Life is pain, life is terror, and man is unhappy."
"Now all is
pain and terror."
"Now man loves life, because he loves pain and terror,
and so they have done according."
"Life is given now for pain and terror,
and that's the deception."
Now man is not yet what he will be.
"There will
be a new man, happy and proud."
"For whom it will be the same to live or
not to live, he will be the new man."
"He who will conquer pain and terror
will himself be a god."
"And this God will not be."""
"""Then this God does exist according to you?"""
"""He does not exist, but He is."
"In the stone there is no pain, but in the
fear of the stone is the pain."
God is the pain of the fear of death.
"He
who will conquer pain and terror will become himself a god."
"Then there
will be a new life, a new man; everything will be new... then they will
divide history into two parts: from the gorilla to the annihilation of
God, and from the annihilation of God to...""

""To the gorilla?"""
"""... To the transformation of the earth, and of man physically."
"Man
will be God, and will be transformed physically, and the world will
be transformed and things will be transformed and thoughts and all
feelings."
"What do you think: will man be changed physically then?"""
"""If it will be just the same living or not living, all will kill
themselves, and perhaps that's what the change will be?"""
"""That's no matter."
They will kill deception.
"Every one who wants the
supreme freedom must dare to kill himself."
"He who dares to kill himself
has found out the secret of the deception."
"There is no freedom beyond;
that is all, and there is nothing beyond."
"He who dares kill himself is
God."
"Now every one can do so that there shall be no God and shall be
nothing."
"But no one has once done it yet."""
"""There have been millions of suicides."""
"""But always not for that; always with terror and not for that object."
Not to kill fear.
"He who kills himself only to kill fear will become a
god at once."""
"""He won't have time, perhaps,"" I observed."
"""That's no matter,"" he answered softly, with calm pride, almost disdain."
"""I'm sorry that you seem to be laughing,"" he added half a minute later."
"""It seems strange to me that you were so irritable this morning and are
now so calm, though you speak with warmth."""
"""This morning?"
"It was funny this morning,"" he answered with a smile."
"""I
don't like scolding, and I never laugh,"" he added mournfully."
"""Yes, you don't spend your nights very cheerfully over your tea."""
I got up and took my cap.
"""You think not?"""
he smiled with some surprise.
"""Why?"
"No, I..."
"I don't
know."""
He was suddenly confused.
"""I know not how it is with the others,
and I feel that I cannot do as others."
"Everybody thinks and then at once
thinks of something else."
I can't think of something else.
"I think all
my life of one thing."
"God has tormented me all my life,"" he ended up
suddenly with astonishing expansiveness."
"""And tell me, if I may ask, why is it you speak Russian not quite
correctly?"
"Surely you haven't forgotten it after five years abroad?"""
"""Don't I speak correctly?"
I don't know.
"No, it's not because of abroad."
"I have talked like that all my life... it's no matter to me."""
"""Another question, a more delicate one."
"I quite believe you that you're
disinclined to meet people and talk very little."
"Why have you talked to
me now?"""
"""To you?"
"This morning you sat so nicely and you... but it's all no
matter... you are like my brother, very much, extremely,"" he added,
flushing."
"""He has been dead seven years."
"He was older, very, very much."""
"""I suppose he had a great influence on your way of thinking?"""
"""N-no."
He said little; he said nothing.
"I'll give your note."""
"He saw me to the gate with a lantern, to lock it after me."
"""Of course
he's mad,"" I decided."
In the gateway I met with another encounter.
"IX

I had only just lifted my leg over the high barrier across the bottom of
the gateway, when suddenly a strong hand clutched at my chest."
"""Who's this?"""
"roared a voice, ""a friend or an enemy?"
"Own up!"""
"""He's one of us; one of us!"""
Liputin's voice squealed near by.
"""It's Mr.
G----v, a young man of classical education, in touch with the highest
society."""
"""I love him if he's in society, clas-si... that means he's high-ly
ed-u-cated."
"The retired Captain Ignat Lebyadkin, at the service of the
world and his friends... if they're true ones, if they're true ones, the
scoundrels."""
"Captain Lebyadkin, a stout, fleshy man over six feet in height, with
curly hair and a red face, was so extremely drunk that he could scarcely
stand up before me, and articulated with difficulty."
"I had seen him
before, however, in the distance."
"""And this one!"""
"he roared again, noticing Kirillov, who was still
standing with the lantern; he raised his fist, but let it fall again at
once."
"""I forgive you for your learning!"
"Ignat Lebyadkin--high-ly
ed-u-cated....

     'A bomb of love with stinging smart
     Exploded in Ignaty's heart."
"In anguish dire I weep again
     The arm that at Sevastopol
     I lost in bitter pain!'"
"Not that I ever was at Sevastopol, or ever lost my arm, but you know
what rhyme is."""
"He pushed up to me with his ugly, tipsy face."
"""He is in a hurry, he is going home!"""
Liputin tried to persuade him.
"""He'll tell Lizaveta Nikolaevna to-morrow."""
"""Lizaveta!"""
he yelled again.
"""Stay, don't go!"
"A variation:
     'Among the Amazons a star,
     Upon her steed she flashes by,
     And smiles upon me from afar,
     The child of aris-to-cra-cy!"
To a Starry Amazon.'
You know that's a hymn.
"It's a hymn, if you're not an ass!"
"The duffers,
they don't understand!"
"Stay!"""
"He caught hold of my coat, though I pulled myself away with all my
might."
"""Tell her I'm a knight and the soul of honour, and as for that Dasha..."
"I'd pick her up and chuck her out.... She's only a serf, she daren't...""

At this point he fell down, for I pulled myself violently out of his
hands and ran into the street."
Liputin clung on to me.
"""Alexey Nilitch will pick him up."
"Do you know what I've just found out
from him?"""
he babbled in desperate haste.
"""Did you hear his verses?"
"He's
sealed those verses to the 'Starry Amazon' in an envelope and is going
to send them to-morrow to Lizaveta Nikolaevna, signed with his name in
full."
"What a fellow!"""
"""I bet you suggested it to him yourself."""
"""You'll lose your bet,"" laughed Liputin."
"""He's in love, in love like a
cat, and do you know it began with hatred."
"He hated Lizaveta Nikolaevna
at first so much, for riding on horseback that he almost swore aloud at
her in the street."
"Yes, he did abuse her!"
"Only the day before yesterday
he swore at her when she rode by--luckily she didn't hear."
"And,
suddenly, to-day--poetry!"
Do you know he means to risk a proposal?
Seriously!
"Seriously!"""
"""I wonder at you, Liputin; whenever there's anything nasty going on
you're always on the spot taking a leading part in it,"" I said angrily."
"""You're going rather far, Mr. G----v. Isn't your poor little
heart quaking, perhaps, in terror of a rival?"""
"""Wha-at!"""
"I cried, standing still."
"""Well, now to punish you I won't say anything more, and wouldn't you
like to know though?"
"Take this alone, that that lout is not a simple
captain now but a landowner of our province, and rather an important
one, too, for Nikolay Vsyevolodovitch sold him all his estate the other
day, formerly of two hundred serfs; and as God's above, I'm not lying."
"I've only just heard it, but it was from a most reliable source."
"And now
you can ferret it out for yourself; I'll say nothing more; good-bye."""
"X


Stepan Trofimovitch was awaiting me with hysterical impatience."
"It
was an hour since he had returned."
"I found him in a state resembling
intoxication; for the first five minutes at least I thought he was
drunk."
"Alas, the visit to the Drozdovs had been the finishing-stroke."
"""_Mon ami!_ I have completely lost the thread... Lise..."
"I love and
respect that angel as before; just as before; but it seems to me they
both asked me simply to find out something from me, that is more simply
to get something out of me, and then to get rid of me.... That's how it
is."""
"""You ought to be ashamed!"""
I couldn't help exclaiming.
"""My friend, now I am utterly alone."
"_Enfin, c'est ridicule._  Would you
believe it, the place is positively packed with mysteries there too."
"They
simply flew at me about those ears and noses, and some mysteries in
Petersburg too."
"You know they hadn't heard till they came about the tricks
Nicolas played here four years ago."
"'You were here, you saw it, is it true that
he is mad?'"
Where they got the idea I can't make out.
"Why is it that
Praskovya is so anxious Nicolas should be mad?"
"The woman will have it so,
she will."
"_Ce Maurice,_ or what's his name, Mavriky Nikolaevitch, _brave
homme tout de même..._ but can it be for his sake, and after she wrote
herself from Paris to _cette pauvre amie?..."
"Enfin,_ this Praskovya, as _cette
chère amie_ calls her, is a type."
"She's Gogol's Madame Box, of immortal
memory, only she's a spiteful Madame Box, a malignant Box, and in an
immensely exaggerated form."""
"""That's making her out a regular packing-case if it's an exaggerated
form."""
"""Well, perhaps it's the opposite; it's all the same, only don't
interrupt me, for I'm all in a whirl."
"They are all at loggerheads,
except Lise, she keeps on with her 'Auntie, auntie!'"
"but Lise's sly, and
there's something behind it too."
Secrets.
"She has quarrelled with the
old lady."
"_Cette pauvre_ auntie tyrannises over every one it's true, and
then there's the governor's wife, and the rudeness of local society, and
Karmazinov's 'rudeness'; and then this idea of madness, _ce Lipoutine,
ce que je ne comprends pas..._ and... and they say she's been putting
vinegar on her head, and here are we with our complaints and
letters.... Oh, how I have tormented her and at such a time!"
"_Je suis un
ingrat!_ Only imagine, I come back and find a letter from her; read it,
read it!"
"Oh, how ungrateful it was of me!"""
He gave me a letter he had just received from Varvara Petrovna.
"She
seemed to have repented of her ""stay at home."""
"The letter was amiable
but decided in tone, and brief."
"She invited Stepan Trofimovitch to come
to her the day after to-morrow, which was Sunday, at twelve o'clock, and
advised him to bring one of his friends with him."
"(My name was mentioned
in parenthesis)."
"She promised on her side to invite Shatov, as the
brother of Darya Pavlovna."
"""You can obtain a final answer from her: will
that be enough for you?"
"Is this the formality you were so anxious for?"""
"""Observe that irritable phrase about formality."
"Poor thing, poor thing,
the friend of my whole life!"
"I confess the sudden determination of my
whole future almost crushed me...."
"I confess I still had hopes, but now
_tout est dit._ I know now that all is over."
"_C'est terrible!_ Oh, that
that Sunday would never come and everything would go on in the old way."
"You would have gone on coming and I'd have gone on here....""

""You've been upset by all those nasty things Liputin said, those
slanders."""
"""My dear, you have touched on another sore spot with your friendly
finger."
"Such friendly fingers are generally merciless and sometimes
unreasonable; _pardon,_ you may not believe it, but I'd almost forgotten
all that, all that nastiness, not that I forgot it, indeed, but in
my foolishness I tried all the while I was with Lise to be happy and
persuaded myself I was happy."
"But now... Oh, now I'm thinking of
that generous, humane woman, so long-suffering with my contemptible
failings--not that she's been altogether long-suffering, but what have
I been with my horrid, worthless character!"
"I'm a capricious child, with
all the egoism of a child and none of the innocence."
"For the last twenty
years she's been looking after me like a nurse, _cette pauvre_ auntie, as
Lise so charmingly calls her.... And now, after twenty years, the child
clamours to be married, sending letter after letter, while her head's
in a vinegar-compress and... now he's got it--on Sunday I shall be a
married man, that's no joke.... And why did I keep insisting myself,
what did I write those letters for?"
"Oh, I forgot."
"Lise idolizes Darya
Pavlovna, she says so anyway; she says of her '_c'est un ange,_ only
rather a reserved one.'"
"They both advised me, even Praskovya."
"...
Praskovya didn't advise me though."
"Oh, what venom lies concealed in
that 'Box'!"
"And Lise didn't exactly advise me: 'What do you want to get
married for,' she said, 'your intellectual pleasures ought to be enough
for you.'"
She laughed.
"I forgive her for laughing, for there's an ache
in her own heart."
"You can't get on without a woman though, they said to
me."
"The infirmities of age are coming upon you, and she will tuck you
up, or whatever it is.... _Ma foi,_ I've been thinking myself all this
time I've been sitting with you that Providence was sending her to me
in the decline of my stormy years and that she would tuck me up, or
whatever they call it... _enfin,_ she'll be handy for the housekeeping."
"See what a litter there is, look how everything's lying about."
"I said it
must be cleared up this morning, and look at the book on the floor!"
"_La
pauvre amie_ was always angry at the untidiness here."
"... Ah, now I shall
no longer hear her voice!"
"_Vingt ans!_ And it seems they've had anonymous
letters."
"Only fancy, it's said that Nicolas has sold Lebyadkin his
property."
_C'est un monstre; et enfin_ what is Lebyadkin?
"Lise listens,
and listens, ooh, how she listens!"
I forgave her laughing.
"I saw her
face as she listened, and _ce Maurice..._I shouldn't care to be in his
shoes now, _brave homme tout de même,_ but rather shy; but never mind
him....""

He paused."
"He was tired and upset, and sat with drooping head, staring
at the floor with his tired eyes."
"I took advantage of the interval to
tell him of my visit to Filipov's house, and curtly and dryly expressed
my opinion that Lebyadkin's sister (whom I had never seen) really
might have been somehow victimised by Nicolas at some time during that
mysterious period of his life, as Liputin had called it, and that it
was very possible that Lebyadkin received sums of money from Nicolas for
some reason, but that was all."
"As for the scandal about Darya Pavlovna,
that was all nonsense, all that brute Liputin's misrepresentations, that
this was anyway what Alexey Nilitch warmly maintained, and we had
no grounds for disbelieving him."
"Stepan Trofimovitch listened to my
assurances with an absent air, as though they did not concern him."
"I
mentioned by the way my conversation with Kirillov, and added that he
might be mad."
"""He's not mad, but one of those shallow-minded people,"" he mumbled
listlessly."
"""_Ces gens-là supposent la nature et la societé humaine
autres que Dieu ne les a faites et qu'elles ne sont réellement._ People
try to make up to them, but Stepan Verhovensky does not, anyway."
"I saw
them that time in Petersburg _avec cette chère amie_ (oh, how I used to
wound her then), and I wasn't afraid of their abuse or even of their
praise."
I'm not afraid now either.
"_Mais parlons d'autre chose...._
I believe I have done dreadful things."
"Only fancy, I sent a letter
yesterday to Darya Pavlovna and... how I curse myself for it!"""
"""What did you write about?"""
"""Oh, my friend, believe me, it was all done in a noble spirit."
"I let
her know that I had written to Nicolas five days before, also in a noble
spirit."""
"""I understand now!"""
I cried with heat.
"""And what right had you to couple
their names like that?"""
"""But, _mon cher,_ don't crush me completely, don't shout at me; as it is
I'm utterly squashed like... a black-beetle."
"And, after all, I thought
it was all so honourable."
"Suppose that something really happened...
_en Suisse_...or was beginning."
"I was bound to question their hearts
beforehand that I..._enfin,_ that I might not constrain their hearts,
and be a stumbling-block in their paths."
"I acted simply from honourable
feeling."""
"""Oh, heavens!"
"What a stupid thing you've done!"""
I cried involuntarily.
"""Yes, yes,"" he assented with positive eagerness."
"""You have never said
anything more just, _c'était bête, mais que faire?"
"Tout est dit._ I shall
marry her just the same even if it be to cover 'another's sins.'"
"So
there was no object in writing, was there?"""
"""You're at that idea again!"""
"""Oh, you won't frighten me with your shouts now."
"You see a different
Stepan Verhovensky before you now."
The man I was is buried.
"_Enfin,
tout est dit._ And why do you cry out?"
"Simply because you're not getting
married, and you won't have to wear a certain decoration on your head."
Does that shock you again?
"My poor friend, you don't know woman, while
I have done nothing but study her."
"'If you want to conquer the world,
conquer yourself'--the one good thing that another romantic like you, my
bride's brother, Shatov, has succeeded in saying."
"I would gladly borrow
from him his phrase."
"Well, here I am ready to conquer myself, and I'm
getting married."
And what am I conquering by way of the whole world?
"Oh, my friend, marriage is the moral death of every proud soul, of all
independence."
"Married life will corrupt me, it will sap my energy, my
courage in the service of the cause."
"Children will come, probably not my
own either--certainly not my own: a wise man is not afraid to face the
truth."
"Liputin proposed this morning putting up barricades to keep out
Nicolas; Liputin's a fool."
"A woman would deceive the all-seeing eye
itself."
"_Le bon Dieu_ knew what He was in for when He was creating woman,
but I'm sure that she meddled in it herself and forced Him to create her
such as she is... and with such attributes: for who would have incurred
so much trouble for nothing?"
"I know Nastasya may be angry with me for
free-thinking, but..._enfin, tout est dit._""

He wouldn't have been himself if he could have dispensed with the cheap
gibing free-thought which was in vogue in his day."
"Now, at any rate, he
comforted himself with a gibe, but not for long."
"""Oh, if that day after to-morrow, that Sunday, might never come!"""
"he
exclaimed suddenly, this time in utter despair."
"""Why could not this
one week be without a Sunday--_si le miracle existe_?"
"What would it be to
Providence to blot out one Sunday from the calendar?"
"If only to prove
His power to the atheists _et que tout soit dit!_ Oh, how I loved her!"
"Twenty years, these twenty years, and she has never understood me!"""
"""But of whom are you talking?"
"Even I don't understand you!"""
"I asked,
wondering."
"""_Vingt ans!_ And she has not once understood me; oh, it's cruel!"
"And can
she really believe that I am marrying from fear, from poverty?"
"Oh, the
shame of it!"
"Oh, Auntie, Auntie, I do it for you!..."
"Oh, let her know,
that Auntie, that she is the one woman I have adored for twenty years!"
"She must learn this, it must be so, if not they will need force to drag
me under _ce qu'on appelle le_ wedding-crown."""
"It was the first time I had heard this confession, and so vigorously
uttered."
I won't conceal the fact that I was terribly tempted to laugh.
I was wrong.
"""He is the only one left me now, the only one, my one hope!"""
"he cried
suddenly, clasping his hands as though struck by a new idea."
"""Only he,
my poor boy, can save me now, and, oh, why doesn't he come!"
"Oh, my son,
oh, my Petrusha.... And though I do not deserve the name of father,
but rather that of tiger, yet..._Laissez-moi, mon ami,_ I'll lie down a
little, to collect my ideas."
"I am so tired, so tired."
"And I think it's
time you were in bed."
"_Voyez vous,_ it's twelve o'clock....""




CHAPTER IV."
"THE CRIPPLE


I

SHATOV WAS NOT PERVERSE but acted on my note, and called at midday on
Lizaveta Nikolaevna."
"We went in almost together; I was also going to
make my first call."
"They were all, that is Liza, her mother, and Mavriky
Nikolaevitch, sitting in the big drawing-room, arguing."
"The mother was
asking Liza to play some waltz on the piano, and as soon as Liza began
to play the piece asked for, declared it was not the right one."
"Mavriky Nikolaevitch in the simplicity of his heart took Liza's part,
maintaining that it was the right waltz."
"The elder lady was so angry
that she began to cry."
She was ill and walked with difficulty.
"Her
legs were swollen, and for the last few days she had been continually
fractious, quarrelling with every one, though she always stood rather
in awe of Liza."
They were pleased to see us.
"Liza flushed with pleasure,
and saying _""merci""_ to me, on Shatov's account of course, went to meet
him, looking at him with interest."
Shatov stopped awkwardly in the doorway.
"Thanking him for coming she led
him up to her mother."
"""This is Mr. Shatov, of whom I have told you, and this is Mr. G----v, a
great friend of mine and of Stepan Trofimovitch's."
"Mavriky Nikolaevitch
made his acquaintance yesterday, too."""
"""And which is the professor?"""
"""There's no professor at all, maman."""
"""But there is."
You said yourself that there'd be a professor.
"It's this
one, probably."""
She disdainfully indicated Shatov.
"""I didn't tell you that there'd be a professor."
"Mr. G----v is
in the service, and Mr. Shatov is a former student."""
"""A student or professor, they all come from the university just the
same."
You only want to argue.
"But the Swiss one had moustaches and a
beard."""
"""It's the son of Stepan Trofimovitch that maman always calls the
professor,"" said Liza, and she took Shatov away to the sofa at the other
end of the drawing-room."
"""When her legs swell, she's always like this, you understand she's
ill,"" she whispered to Shatov, still with the same marked curiosity,
scrutinising him, especially his shock of hair."
"""Are you an officer?"""
the old lady inquired of me.
"Liza had mercilessly
abandoned me to her."
"""N-no.--I'm in the service....""

""Mr. G----v is a great friend of Stepan Trofimovitch's,"" Liza chimed in
immediately."
"""Are you in Stepan Trofimovitch's service?"
"Yes, and he's a professor,
too, isn't he?"""
"""Ah, maman, you must dream at night of professors,"" cried Liza with
annoyance."
"""I see too many when I'm awake."
"But you always will contradict your
mother."
"Were you here four years ago when Nikolay Vsyevolodovitch was in
the neighbourhood?"""
I answered that I was.
"""And there was some Englishman with you?"""
"""No, there was not."""
Liza laughed.
"""Well, you see there was no Englishman, so it must have been idle
gossip."
And Varvara Petrovna and Stepan Trofimovitch both tell lies.
"And
they all tell lies."""
"""Auntie and Stepan Trofimovitch yesterday thought there was a
resemblance between Nikolay Vsyevolodovitch and Prince Harry in
Shakespeare's _Henry IV_, and in answer to that maman says that there was
no Englishman here,"" Liza explained to us."
"""If Harry wasn't here, there was no Englishman."
"It was no one else but
Nikolay Vsyevolodovitch at his tricks."""
"""I assure you that maman's doing it on purpose,"" Liza thought necessary
to explain to Shatov."
"""She's really heard of Shakespeare."
"I read her the
first act of _Othello_ myself."
But she's in great pain now.
"Maman, listen,
it's striking twelve, it's time you took your medicine."""
"""The doctor's come,"" a maid-servant announced at the door."
"The old lady got up and began calling her dog: ""Zemirka, Zemirka, you
come with me at least."""
"Zemirka, a horrid little old dog, instead of obeying, crept under the
sofa where Liza was sitting."
"""Don't you want to?"
Then I don't want you.
"Good-bye, my good sir, I
don't know your name or your father's,"" she said, addressing me."
"""Anton Lavrentyevitch...""

""Well, it doesn't matter, with me it goes in at one ear and out of the
other."
"Don't you come with me, Mavriky Nikolaevitch, it was Zemirka I
called."
"Thank God I can still walk without help and to-morrow I shall go
for a drive."""
She walked angrily out of the drawing-room.
"""Anton Lavrentyevitch, will you talk meanwhile to Mavriky Nikolaevitch;
I assure you you'll both be gainers by getting to know one another
better,"" said Liza, and she gave a friendly smile to Mavriky
Nikolaevitch, who beamed all over as she looked at him."
"There was no
help for it, I remained to talk to Mavriky Nikolaevitch."
"II

Lizaveta Nikolaevna's business with Shatov turned out, to my surprise,
to be really only concerned with literature."
"I had imagined, I don't
know why, that she had asked him to come with some other object."
"We,
Mavriky Nikolaevitch and I that is, seeing that they were talking aloud
and not trying to hide anything from us, began to listen, and at last
they asked our advice."
"It turned out that Lizaveta Nikolaevna was
thinking of bringing out a book which she thought would be of use,
but being quite inexperienced she needed someone to help her."
"The
earnestness with which she began to explain her plan to Shatov quite
surprised me."
"""She must be one of the new people,"" I thought."
"""She has not been to
Switzerland for nothing."""
"Shatov listened with attention, his eyes fixed on the ground, showing
not the slightest surprise that a giddy young lady in society should
take up work that seemed so out of keeping with her."
Her literary scheme was as follows.
"Numbers of papers and journals are
published in the capitals and the provinces of Russia, and every day a
number of events are reported in them."
"The year passes, the newspapers
are everywhere folded up and put away in cupboards, or are torn up
and become litter, or are used for making parcels or wrapping things."
"Numbers of these facts make an impression and are remembered by the
public, but in the course of years they are forgotten."
"Many people would
like to look them up, but it is a labour for them to embark upon this
sea of paper, often knowing nothing of the day or place or even year in
which the incident occurred."
"Yet if all the facts for a whole year were
brought together into one book, on a definite plan, and with a definite
object, under headings with references, arranged according to months and
days, such a compilation might reflect the characteristics of Russian
life for the whole year, even though the facts published are only a
small fraction of the events that take place."
"""Instead of a number of newspapers there would be a few fat books,
that's all,"" observed Shatov."
"But Lizaveta Nikolaevna clung to her idea, in spite of the difficulty
of carrying it out and her inability to describe it."
"""It ought to be
one book, and not even a very thick one,"" she maintained."
"But even if it
were thick it would be clear, for the great point would be the plan and
the character of the presentation of facts."
"Of course not all would
be collected and reprinted."
"The decrees and acts of government,
local regulations, laws--all such facts, however important, might be
altogether omitted from the proposed publication."
"They could leave out a
great deal and confine themselves to a selection of events more or
less characteristic of the moral life of the people, of the personal
character of the Russian people at the present moment."
"Of course
everything might be put in: strange incidents, fires, public
subscriptions, anything good or bad, every speech or word, perhaps even
floodings of the rivers, perhaps even some government decrees, but
only such things to be selected as are characteristic of the period;
everything would be put in with a certain view, a special significance
and intention, with an idea which would illuminate the facts looked
at in the aggregate, as a whole."
"And finally the book ought to be
interesting even for light reading, apart from its value as a work of
reference."
"It would be, so to say, a presentation of the spiritual,
moral, inner life of Russia for a whole year."
"""We want every one to buy it, we want it to be a book that will be found
on every table,"" Liza declared."
"""I understand that all lies in the plan,
and that's why I apply to you,"" she concluded."
"She grew very warm over
it, and although her explanation was obscure and incomplete, Shatov
began to understand."
"""So it would amount to something with a political tendency, a selection
of facts with a special tendency,"" he muttered, still not raising his
head."
"""Not at all, we must not select with a particular bias, and we ought
not to have any political tendency in it."
"Nothing but impartiality--that
will be the only tendency."""
"""But a tendency would be no harm,"" said Shatov, with a slight movement,
""and one can hardly avoid it if there is any selection at all."
"The very
selection of facts will suggest how they are to be understood."
"Your idea
is not a bad one."""
"""Then such a book is possible?"""
cried Liza delightedly.
"""We must look into it and consider."
It's an immense undertaking.
"One
can't work it out on the spur of the moment."
We need experience.
"And
when we do publish the book I doubt whether we shall find out how to
do it."
Possibly after many trials; but the thought is alluring.
"It's a
useful idea."""
"He raised his eyes at last, and they were positively sparkling with
pleasure, he was so interested."
"""Was it your own idea?"""
"he asked Liza, in a friendly and, as it were,
bashful way."
"""The idea's no trouble, you know, it's the plan is the trouble,"" Liza
smiled."
"""I understand very little."
"I am not very clever, and I only
pursue what is clear to me, myself....""

""Pursue?"""
"""Perhaps that's not the right word?"""
Liza inquired quickly.
"""The word is all right; I meant nothing."""
"""I thought while I was abroad that even I might be of some use."
"I have
money of my own lying idle."
"Why shouldn't I--even I--work for the common
cause?"
"Besides, the idea somehow occurred to me all at once of itself."
"I didn't invent it at all, and was delighted with it."
"But I saw at
once that I couldn't get on without someone to help, because I am not
competent to do anything of myself."
"My helper, of course, would be the
co-editor of the book."
We would go halves.
"You would give the plan and
the work."
"Mine would be the original idea and the means for publishing
it."
"Would the book pay its expenses, do you think?"""
"""If we hit on a good plan the book will go."""
"""I warn you that I am not doing it for profit; but I am very anxious
that the book should circulate and should be very proud of making a
profit."""
"""Well, but how do I come in?"""
"""Why, I invite you to be my fellow-worker, to go halves."
"You will think
out the plan."""
"""How do you know that I am capable of thinking out the plan?"""
"""People have talked about you to me, and here I've heard
..."
"I know that you are very clever and... are working for the cause ...
and think a great deal."
"Pyotr Stepanovitch Verhovensky spoke about you
in Switzerland,"" she added hurriedly."
"""He's a very clever man, isn't
he?"""
"Shatov stole a fleeting, momentary glance at her, but dropped his eyes
again."
"""Nikolay Vsyevolodovitch told me a great deal about you, too."""
Shatov suddenly turned red.
"""But here are the newspapers."""
"Liza hurriedly picked up from a chair
a bundle of newspapers that lay tied up ready."
"""I've tried to mark
the facts here for selection, to sort them, and I have put the papers
together... you will see."""
Shatov took the bundle.
"""Take them home and look at them."
"Where do you live?"""
"""In Bogoyavlensky Street, Filipov's house."""
"""I know."
"I think it's there, too, I've been told, a captain lives,
beside you, Mr. Lebyadkin,"" said Liza in the same hurried manner."
"Shatov sat for a full minute with the bundle in his outstretched hand,
making no answer and staring at the floor."
"""You'd better find someone else for these jobs."
"I shouldn't suit you at
all,"" he brought out at last, dropping his voice in an awfully strange
way, almost to a whisper."
Liza flushed crimson.
"""What jobs are you speaking of?"
"Mavriky Nikolaevitch,"" she cried,
""please bring that letter here."""
I too followed Mavriky Nikolaevitch to the table.
"""Look at this,"" she turned suddenly to me, unfolding the letter in great
excitement."
"""Have you ever seen anything like it."
Please read it aloud.
"I want Mr. Shatov to hear it too."""
"With no little astonishment I read aloud the following missive:

     ""To the Perfection, Miss Tushin."
"""Gracious Lady
    ""Lizaveta Nikolaevna!"
"""Oh, she's a sweet queen,
     Lizaveta Tushin!"
"When on side-saddle she gallops by,
     And in the breeze her fair tresses fly!"
"Or when with her mother in church she bows low
     And on devout faces a red flush doth flow!"
"Then for the joys of lawful wedlock I aspire,
     And follow her and her mother with tears of desire."
"""Composed by an unlearned man in the midst of a discussion."
"""Gracious Lady!"
"""I pity myself above all men that I did not lose my arm at Sevastopol,
not having been there at all, but served all the campaign delivering
paltry provisions, which I look on as a degradation."
"You are a goddess
of antiquity, and I am nothing, but have had a glimpse of infinity."
"Look on it as a poem and no more, for, after all, poetry is nonsense and
justifies what would be considered impudence in prose."
"Can the sun be
angry with the infusoria if the latter composes verses to her from the
drop of water, where there is a multitude of them if you look through
the microscope?"
"Even the club for promoting humanity to the larger
animals in tip-top society in Petersburg, which rightly feels compassion
for dogs and horses, despises the brief infusoria making no reference
to it whatever, because it is not big enough."
I'm not big enough either.
"The idea of marriage might seem droll, but soon I shall have property
worth two hundred souls through a misanthropist whom you ought to
despise."
"I can tell a lot and I can undertake to produce documents
that would mean Siberia."
Don't despise my proposal.
"A letter from an
infusoria is of course in verse."
"""Captain Lebyadkin your most humble friend."
"""And he has time no end."""
"""That was written by a man in a drunken condition, a worthless fellow,""
I cried indignantly."
"""I know him."""
"""That letter I received yesterday,"" Liza began to explain, flushing
and speaking hurriedly."
"""I saw myself, at once, that it came from some
foolish creature, and I haven't yet shown it to maman, for fear of
upsetting her more."
"But if he is going to keep on like that, I don't
know how to act."
"Mavriky Nikolaevitch wants to go out and forbid him to
do it."
"As I have looked upon you as a colleague,"" she turned to Shatov,
""and as you live there, I wanted to question you so as to judge what
more is to be expected of him."""
"""He's a drunkard and a worthless fellow,"" Shatov muttered with apparent
reluctance."
"""Is he always so stupid?"""
"""No, he's not stupid at all when he's not drunk."""
"""I used to know a general who wrote verses exactly like that,"" I
observed, laughing."
"""One can see from the letter that he is clever enough for his own
purposes,"" Mavriky Nikolaevitch, who had till then been silent, put in
unexpectedly."
"""He lives with some sister?"""
Liza queried.
"""Yes, with his sister."""
"""They say he tyrannises over her, is that true?"""
"Shatov looked at Liza again, scowled, and muttering, ""What business is
it of mine?"""
moved towards the door.
"""Ah, stay!"""
"cried Liza, in a flutter."
"""Where are you going?"
"We have so
much still to talk over....""

""What is there to talk over?"
"I'll let you know to-morrow."""
"""Why, the most important thing of all--the printing-press!"
"Do believe me
that I am not in jest, that I really want to work in good earnest!"""
"Liza
assured him in growing agitation."
"""If we decide to publish it, where is
it to be printed?"
"You know it's a most important question, for we shan't
go to Moscow for it, and the printing-press here is out of the
question for such a publication."
"I made up my mind long ago to set up
a printing-press of my own, in your name perhaps--and I know maman will
allow it so long as it is in your name....""

""How do you know that I could be a printer?"""
Shatov asked sullenly.
"""Why, Pyotr Stepanovitch told me of you in Switzerland, and referred
me to you as one who knows the business and able to set up a
printing-press."
"He even meant to give me a note to you from himself, but
I forgot it."""
"Shatov's face changed, as I recollect now."
"He stood for a few seconds
longer, then went out of the room."
Liza was angry.
"""Does he always go out like that?"""
"she asked, turning to me."
"I was just shrugging my shoulders when Shatov suddenly came back, went
straight up to the table and put down the roll of papers he had taken."
"""I'm not going to be your helper, I haven't the time....""

""Why?"
Why?
"I think you are angry!"""
"Liza asked him in a grieved and
imploring voice."
"The sound of her voice seemed to strike him; for some moments he looked
at her intently, as though trying to penetrate to her very soul."
"""No matter,"" he muttered, softly, ""I don't want to....""

And he went away altogether."
"Liza was completely overwhelmed, quite disproportionately in fact, so it
seemed to me."
"""Wonderfully queer man,"" Mavriky Nikolaevitch observed aloud."
"III

He certainly was queer, but in all this there was a very great deal not
clear to me."
There was something underlying it all.
"I simply did not
believe in this publication; then that stupid letter, in which there
was an offer, only too barefaced, to give information and produce
""documents,"" though they were all silent about that, and talked of
something quite different; finally that printing-press and Shatov's
sudden exit, just because they spoke of a printing-press."
"All this led
me to imagine that something had happened before I came in of which I
knew nothing; and, consequently, that it was no business of mine and
that I was in the way."
"And, indeed, it was time to take leave, I had
stayed long enough for the first call."
"I went up to say good-bye to
Lizaveta Nikolaevna."
"She seemed to have forgotten that I was in the room, and was still
standing in the same place by the table with her head bowed, plunged in
thought, gazing fixedly at one spot on the carpet."
"""Ah, you, too, are going, good-bye,"" she murmured in an ordinary
friendly tone."
"""Give my greetings to Stepan Trofimovitch, and persuade
him to come and see me as soon as he can."
"Mavriky Nikolaevitch, Anton
Lavrentyevitch is going."
"Excuse maman's not being able to come out and
say good-bye to you....""

I went out and had reached the bottom of the stairs when a footman
suddenly overtook me at the street door."
"""My lady begs you to come back....""

""The mistress, or Lizaveta Nikolaevna?"""
"""The young lady."""
"I found Liza not in the big room where we had been sitting, but in the
reception-room next to it."
"The door between it and the drawing-room,
where Mavriky Nikolaevitch was left alone, was closed."
Liza smiled to me but was pale.
"She was standing in the middle of the
room in evident indecision, visibly struggling with herself; but she
suddenly took me by the hand, and led me quickly to the window."
"""I want to see _her_ at once,"" she whispered, bending upon me a
burning, passionate, impatient glance, which would not admit a hint of
opposition."
"""I must see her with my own eyes, and I beg you to help
me."""
"She was in a perfect frenzy, and--in despair."
"""Who is it you want to see, Lizaveta Nikolaevna?"""
I inquired in dismay.
"""That Lebyadkin's sister, that lame girl.... Is it true that she's
lame?"""
I was astounded.
"""I have never seen her, but I've heard that she's lame."
"I heard it
yesterday,"" I said with hurried readiness, and also in a whisper."
"""I must see her, absolutely."
"Could you arrange it to-day?"""
I felt dreadfully sorry for her.
"""That's utterly impossible, and, besides, I should not know at all how
to set about it,"" I began persuading her."
"""I'll go to Shatov....""

""If you don't arrange it by to-morrow I'll go to her by myself, alone,
for Mavriky Nikolaevitch has refused."
"I rest all my hopes on you and
I've no one else; I spoke stupidly to Shatov...."
"I'm sure that you are
perfectly honest and perhaps ready to do anything for me, only arrange
it."""
I felt a passionate desire to help her in every way.
"""This is what I'll do,"" I said, after a moment's thought."
"""I'll go
myself to-day and will see her for sure, for sure."
"I will manage so
as to see her."
I give you my word of honour.
"Only let me confide in
Shatov."""
"""Tell him that I do desire it, and that I can't wait any longer, but
that I wasn't deceiving him just now."
"He went away perhaps because
he's very honest and he didn't like my seeming to deceive him."
"I
wasn't deceiving him, I really do want to edit books and found a
printing-press....""

""He is honest, very honest,"" I assented warmly."
"""If it's not arranged by to-morrow, though, I shall go myself whatever
happens, and even if every one were to know."""
"""I can't be with you before three o'clock to-morrow,"" I observed, after
a moment's deliberation."
"""At three o'clock then."
"Then it was true what I imagined yesterday at
Stepan Trofimovitch's, that you--are rather devoted to me?"""
"she said
with a smile, hurriedly pressing my hand to say good-bye, and hurrying
back to the forsaken Mavriky Nikolaevitch."
"I went out weighed down by my promise, and unable to understand what
had happened."
"I had seen a woman in real despair, not hesitating to
compromise herself by confiding in a man she hardly knew."
"Her womanly
smile at a moment so terrible for her and her hint that she had noticed
my feelings the day before sent a pang to my heart; but I felt sorry
for her, very sorry--that was all!"
"Her secrets became at once something
sacred for me, and if anyone had begun to reveal them to me now, I think
I should have covered my ears, and should have refused to hear anything
more."
"I only had a presentiment of something... yet I was utterly at
a loss to see how I could do anything."
"What's more I did not even yet
understand exactly what I had to arrange; an interview, but what sort
of an interview?"
And how could I bring them together?
"My only hope was
Shatov, though I could be sure that he wouldn't help me in any way."
"But
all the same, I hurried to him."
"IV

I did not find him at home till past seven o'clock that evening."
"To my
surprise he had visitors with him--Alexey Nilitch, and another gentleman
I hardly knew, one Shigalov, the brother of Virginsky's wife."
"This gentleman must, I think, have been staying about two months in
the town; I don't know where he came from."
"I had only heard that he
had written some sort of article in a progressive Petersburg magazine."
Virginsky had introduced me casually to him in the street.
"I had
never in my life seen in a man's face so much despondency, gloom, and
moroseness."
"He looked as though he were expecting the destruction of the
world, and not at some indefinite time in accordance with prophecies,
which might never be fulfilled, but quite definitely, as though it were
to be the day after to-morrow at twenty-five minutes past ten."
"We hardly
said a word to one another on that occasion, but had simply shaken hands
like two conspirators."
"I was most struck by his ears, which were of
unnatural size, long, broad, and thick, sticking out in a peculiar way."
His gestures were slow and awkward.
"If Liputin had imagined that a phalanstery might be established in our
province, this gentleman certainly knew the day and the hour when it
would be founded."
He made a sinister impression on me.
"I was the more
surprised at finding him here, as Shatov was not fond of visitors."
"I could hear from the stairs that they were talking very loud, all three
at once, and I fancy they were disputing; but as soon as I went in, they
all ceased speaking."
"They were arguing, standing up, but now they all
suddenly sat down, so that I had to sit down too."
"There was a stupid
silence that was not broken for fully three minutes."
"Though Shigalov
knew me, he affected not to know me, probably not from hostile feelings,
but for no particular reason."
"Alexey Nilitch and I bowed to one another
in silence, and for some reason did not shake hands."
"Shigalov began at
last looking at me sternly and frowningly, with the most naïve assurance
that I should immediately get up and go away."
"At last Shatov got up from
his chair and the others jumped up at once."
"They went out without saying
good-bye."
"Shigalov only said in the doorway to Shatov, who was seeing
him out:

""Remember that you are bound to give an explanation."""
"""Hang your explanation, and who the devil am I bound to?"""
said Shatov.
He showed them out and fastened the door with the latch.
"""Snipes!"""
"he said, looking at me, with a sort of wry smile."
"His face looked angry, and it seemed strange to me that he spoke first."
"When I had been to see him before (which was not often) it had usually
happened that he sat scowling in a corner, answered ill-humouredly
and only completely thawed and began to talk with pleasure after a
considerable time."
"Even so, when he was saying good-bye he always
scowled, and let one out as though he were getting rid of a personal
enemy."
"""I had tea yesterday with that Alexey Nilitch,"" I observed."
"""I think
he's mad on atheism."""
"""Russian atheism has never gone further than making a joke,"" growled
Shatov, putting up a new candle in place of an end that had burnt out."
"""No, this one doesn't seem to me a joker, I think he doesn't know how to
talk, let alone trying to make jokes."""
"""Men made of paper!"
"It all comes from flunkeyism of thought,"" Shatov
observed calmly, sitting down on a chair in the corner, and pressing the
palms of both hands on his knees."
"""There's hatred in it, too,"" he went on, after a minute's pause."
"""They'd be the first to be terribly unhappy if Russia could be suddenly
reformed, even to suit their own ideas, and became extraordinarily
prosperous and happy."
"They'd have no one to hate then, no one to curse,
nothing to find fault with."
"There is nothing in it but an immense animal
hatred for Russia which has eaten into their organism.... And it isn't
a case of tears unseen by the world under cover of a smile!"
"There has
never been a falser word said in Russia than about those unseen tears,""
he cried, almost with fury."
"""Goodness only knows what you're saying,"" I laughed."
"""Oh, you're a 'moderate liberal,'"" said Shatov, smiling too."
"""Do you
know,"" he went on suddenly, ""I may have been talking nonsense about the
'flunkeyism of thought.'"
"You will say to me no doubt directly, 'it's you
who are the son of a flunkey, but I'm not a flunkey.'"""
"""I wasn't dreaming of such a thing.... What are you saying!"""
"""You need not apologise."
I'm not afraid of you.
"Once I was only the
son of a flunkey, but now I've become a flunkey myself, like you."
"Our
Russian liberal is a flunkey before everything, and is only looking for
someone whose boots he can clean."""
"""What boots?"
"What allegory is this?"""
"""Allegory, indeed!"
"You are laughing, I see.... Stepan Trofimovitch said
truly that I lie under a stone, crushed but not killed, and do nothing
but wriggle."
"It was a good comparison of his."""
"""Stepan Trofimovitch declares that you are mad over the Germans,"" I
laughed."
"""We've borrowed something from them anyway."""
"""We took twenty kopecks, but we gave up a hundred roubles of our own."""
We were silent a minute.
"""He got that sore lying in America."""
"""Who?"
"What sore?"""
"""I mean Kirillov."
"I spent four months with him lying on the floor of a
hut."""
"""Why, have you been in America?"""
"I asked, surprised."
"""You never told me
about it."""
"""What is there to tell?"
"The year before last we spent our last farthing,
three of us, going to America in an emigrant steamer, to test the
life of the American workman on ourselves, and to verify by personal
experiment the state of a man in the hardest social conditions."
"That was
our object in going there."""
"""Good Lord!"""
I laughed.
"""You'd much better have gone somewhere in our
province at harvest-time if you wanted to 'make a personal experiment'
instead of bolting to America."""
"""We hired ourselves out as workmen to an exploiter; there were six of
us Russians working for him--students, even landowners coming from their
estates, some officers, too, and all with the same grand object."
"Well,
so we worked, sweated, wore ourselves out; Kirillov and I were exhausted
at last; fell ill--went away--we couldn't stand it."
"Our employer cheated
us when he paid us off; instead of thirty dollars, as he had agreed, he
paid me eight and Kirillov fifteen; he beat us, too, more than once."
"So
then we were left without work, Kirillov and I, and we spent four months
lying on the floor in that little town."
"He thought of one thing and I
thought of another."""
"""You don't mean to say your employer beat you?"
In America?
"How you must
have sworn at him!"""
"""Not a bit of it."
"On the contrary, Kirillov and I made up our minds
from the first that we Russians were like little children beside the
Americans, and that one must be born in America, or at least live for
many years with Americans to be on a level with them."
"And do you know,
if we were asked a dollar for a thing worth a farthing, we used to pay
it with pleasure, in fact with enthusiasm."
"We approved of everything:
spiritualism, lynch-law, revolvers, tramps."
"Once when we were travelling
a fellow slipped his hand into my pocket, took my brush, and began
brushing his hair with it."
"Kirillov and I only looked at one another,
and made up our minds that that was the right thing and that we liked it
very much....""

""The strange thing is that with us all this is not only in the brain but
is carried out in practice,"" I observed."
"""Men made of paper,"" Shatov repeated."
"""But to cross the ocean in an emigrant steamer, though, to go to an
unknown country, even to make a personal experiment and all that--by
Jove... there really is a large-hearted staunchness about it...."
"But
how did you get out of it?"""
"""I wrote to a man in Europe and he sent me a hundred roubles."""
"As Shatov talked he looked doggedly at the ground as he always did, even
when he was excited."
At this point he suddenly raised his head.
"""Do you want to know the man's name?"""
"""Who was it?"""
"""Nikolay Stavrogin."""
"He got up suddenly, turned to his limewood writing-table and
began searching for something on it."
"There was a vague, though
well-authenticated rumour among us that Shatov's wife had at one time
had a liaison with Nikolay Stavrogin, in Paris, and just about two years
ago, that is when Shatov was in America."
"It is true that this was long
after his wife had left him in Geneva."
"""If so, what possesses him now to bring his name forward and to lay
stress on it?"""
I thought.
"""I haven't paid him back yet,"" he said, turning suddenly to me again,
and looking at me intently he sat down in the same place as before in
the corner, and asked abruptly, in quite a different voice:

""You have come no doubt with some object."
"What do you want?"""
"I told him everything immediately, in its exact historical order, and
added that though I had time to think it over coolly after the first
excitement was over, I was more puzzled than ever."
"I saw that it meant
something very important to Lizaveta Nikolaevna."
"I was extremely anxious
to help her, but the trouble was that I didn't know how to keep the
promise I had made her, and didn't even quite understand now what I had
promised her."
"Then I assured him impressively once more that she had not
meant to deceive him, and had had no thought of doing so; that there had
been some misunderstanding, and that she had been very much hurt by the
extraordinary way in which he had gone off that morning."
He listened very attentively.
"""Perhaps I was stupid this morning, as I usually am.... Well, if she
didn't understand why I went away like that... so much the better for
her."""
"He got up, went to the door, opened it, and began listening on the
stairs."
"""Do you want to see that person yourself?"""
"""That's just what I wanted, but how is it to be done?"""
"I cried,
delighted."
"""Let's simply go down while she's alone."
"When he comes in he'll beat
her horribly if he finds out we've been there."
I often go in on the sly.
"I went for him this morning when he began beating her again."""
"""What do you mean?"""
"""I dragged him off her by the hair."
"He tried to beat me, but I
frightened him, and so it ended."
"I'm afraid he'll come back drunk, and
won't forget it--he'll give her a bad beating because of it."""
We went downstairs at once.
"The Lebyadkins' door was shut but not locked, and we were able to go in."
"Their lodging consisted of two nasty little rooms, with smoke-begrimed
walls on which the filthy wall-paper literally hung in tatters."
"It
had been used for some years as an eating-house, until Filipov, the
tavern-keeper, moved to another house."
"The other rooms below what had
been the eating-house were now shut up, and these two were all the
Lebyadkins had."
"The furniture consisted of plain benches and deal
tables, except for an old arm-chair that had lost its arms."
"In the
second room there was the bedstead that belonged to Mlle."
"Lebyadkin
standing in the corner, covered with a chintz quilt; the captain himself
went to bed anywhere on the floor, often without undressing."
"Everything
was in disorder, wet and filthy; a huge soaking rag lay in the middle
of the floor in the first room, and a battered old shoe lay beside it
in the wet."
It was evident that no one looked after anything here.
"The
stove was not heated, food was not cooked; they had not even a samovar
as Shatov told me."
"The captain had come to the town with his sister
utterly destitute, and had, as Liputin said, at first actually gone from
house to house begging."
"But having unexpectedly received some money, he
had taken to drinking at once, and had become so besotted that he was
incapable of looking after things."
Mlle.
"Lebyadkin, whom I was so anxious to see, was sitting quietly at
a deal kitchen table on a bench in the corner of the inner room, not
making a sound."
"When we opened the door she did not call out to us or
even move from her place."
"Shatov said that the door into the passage
would not lock and it had once stood wide open all night."
"By the dim
light of a thin candle in an iron candlestick, I made out a woman of
about thirty, perhaps, sickly and emaciated, wearing an old dress of
dark cotton material, with her long neck uncovered, her scanty dark hair
twisted into a knot on the nape of her neck, no larger than the fist of
a two-year-old child."
She looked at us rather cheerfully.
"Besides the
candlestick, she had on the table in front of her a little peasant
looking-glass, an old pack of cards, a tattered book of songs, and a
white roll of German bread from which one or two bites had been taken."
It was noticeable that Mlle.
"Lebyadkin used powder and rouge, and
painted her lips."
"She also blackened her eyebrows, which were fine,
long, and black enough without that."
"Three long wrinkles stood sharply
conspicuous across her high, narrow forehead in spite of the powder on
it."
"I already knew that she was lame, but on this occasion she did not
attempt to get up or walk."
"At some time, perhaps in early youth, that
wasted face may have been pretty; but her soft, gentle grey eyes were
remarkable even now."
"There was something dreamy and sincere in her
gentle, almost joyful, expression."
"This gentle serene joy, which was
reflected also in her smile, astonished me after all I had heard of the
Cossack whip and her brother's violence."
"Strange to say, instead of the
oppressive repulsion and almost dread one usually feels in the presence
of these creatures afflicted by God, I felt it almost pleasant to look
at her from the first moment, and my heart was filled afterwards with
pity in which there was no trace of aversion."
"""This is how she sits literally for days together, utterly alone,
without moving; she tries her fortune with the cards, or looks in the
looking-glass,"" said Shatov, pointing her out to me from the doorway."
"""He doesn't feed her, you know."
"The old woman in the lodge brings her
something sometimes out of charity; how can they leave her all alone
like this with a candle!"""
"To my surprise Shatov spoke aloud, just as though she were not in the
room."
"""Good day, Shatushka!"""
Mlle.
Lebyadkin said genially.
"""I've brought you a visitor, Marya Timofyevna,"" said Shatov."
"""The visitor is very welcome."
"I don't know who it is you've brought, I
don't seem to remember him."""
"She scrutinised me intently from behind the
candle, and turned again at once to Shatov (and she took no more notice
of me for the rest of the conversation, as though I had not been near
her)."
"""Are you tired of walking up and down alone in your garret?"""
"she
laughed, displaying two rows of magnificent teeth."
"""I was tired of it, and I wanted to come and see you."""
"Shatov moved a bench up to the table, sat down on it and made me sit
beside him."
"""I'm always glad to have a talk, though you're a funny person,
Shatushka, just like a monk."
When did you comb your hair last?
"Let me
do it for you."""
And she pulled a little comb out of her pocket.
"""I don't
believe you've touched it since I combed it last."""
"""Well, I haven't got a comb,"" said Shatov, laughing too."
"""Really?"
"Then I'll give you mine; only remind me, not this one but
another."""
With a most serious expression she set to work to comb his hair.
"She
even parted it on one side; drew back a little, looked to see whether it
was right and put the comb back in her pocket."
"""Do you know what, Shatushka?"""
She shook her head.
"""You may be a very
sensible man but you're dull."
It's strange for me to look at all of you.
I don't understand how it is people are dull.
Sadness is not dullness.
"I'm happy."""
"""And are you happy when your brother's here?"""
"""You mean Lebyadkin?"
He's my footman.
"And I don't care whether he's
here or not."
"I call to him: 'Lebyadkin, bring the water!'"
"or 'Lebyadkin,
bring my shoes!'"
and he runs.
"Sometimes one does wrong and can't help
laughing at him."""
"""That's just how it is,"" said Shatov, addressing me aloud without
ceremony."
"""She treats him just like a footman."
"I've heard her myself
calling to him, 'Lebyadkin, give me some water!'"
"And she laughed as
she said it."
"The only difference is that he doesn't fetch the water but
beats her for it; but she isn't a bit afraid of him."
"She has some sort
of nervous fits, almost every day, and they are destroying her memory
so that afterwards she forgets everything that's just happened, and is
always in a muddle over time."
"You imagine she remembers how you came in;
perhaps she does remember, but no doubt she has changed everything to
please herself, and she takes us now for different people from what we
are, though she knows I'm 'Shatushka.'"
"It doesn't matter my speaking
aloud, she soon leaves off listening to people who talk to her, and
plunges into dreams."
"Yes, plunges."
"She's an extraordinary person for
dreaming; she'll sit for eight hours, for whole days together in the
same place."
"You see there's a roll lying there, perhaps she's only taken
one bite at it since the morning, and she'll finish it to-morrow."
"Now
she's begun trying her fortune on cards....""

""I keep trying my fortune, Shatushka, but it doesn't come out right,""
Marya Timofyevna put in suddenly, catching the last word, and without
looking at it she put out her left hand for the roll (she had heard
something about the roll too very likely)."
"She got hold of the roll
at last and after keeping it for some time in her left hand, while her
attention was distracted by the conversation which sprang up again, she
put it back again on the table unconsciously without having taken a bite
of it."
"""It always comes out the same, a journey, a wicked man, somebody's
treachery, a death-bed, a letter, unexpected news."
"I think it's all
nonsense."
"Shatushka, what do you think?"
"If people can tell lies why
shouldn't a card?"""
She suddenly threw the cards together again.
"""I said
the same thing to Mother Praskovya, she's a very venerable woman, she
used to run to my cell to tell her fortune on the cards, without letting
the Mother Superior know."
"Yes, and she wasn't the only one who came to
me."
"They sigh, and shake their heads at me, they talk it over while I
laugh."
"'Where are you going to get a letter from, Mother Praskovya,' I
say, 'when you haven't had one for twelve years?'"
"Her daughter had been
taken away to Turkey by her husband, and for twelve years there had been
no sight nor sound of her."
"Only I was sitting the next evening at tea
with the Mother Superior (she was a princess by birth), there was some
lady there too, a visitor, a great dreamer, and a little monk from Athos
was sitting there too, a rather absurd man to my thinking."
"What do you
think, Shatushka, that monk from Athos had brought Mother Praskovya a
letter from her daughter in Turkey, that morning--so much for the knave
of diamonds--unexpected news!"
"We were drinking our tea, and the monk
from Athos said to the Mother Superior, 'Blessed Mother Superior, God
has blessed your convent above all things in that you preserve so great
a treasure in its precincts,' said he."
'What treasure is that?'
"asked
the Mother Superior."
"'The Mother Lizaveta, the Blessed.'"
"This Lizaveta
the Blessed was enshrined in the nunnery wall, in a cage seven feet long
and five feet high, and she had been sitting there for seventeen years
in nothing but a hempen shift, summer and winter, and she always kept
pecking at the hempen cloth with a straw or a twig of some sort, and she
never said a word, and never combed her hair, or washed, for seventeen
years."
"In the winter they used to put a sheepskin in for her, and every
day a piece of bread and a jug of water."
"The pilgrims gaze at her, sigh
and exclaim, and make offerings of money."
"'A treasure you've pitched
on,' answered the Mother Superior--(she was angry, she disliked Lizaveta
dreadfully)--'Lizaveta only sits there out of spite, out of pure
obstinacy, it is nothing but hypocrisy.'"
"I didn't like this; I was
thinking at the time of shutting myself up too."
"'I think,' said I, 'that
God and nature are just the same thing.'"
"They all cried out with
one voice at me, 'Well, now!'"
"The Mother Superior laughed, whispered
something to the lady and called me up, petted me, and the lady gave me
a pink ribbon."
Would you like me to show it to you?
"And the monk began
to admonish me."
"But he talked so kindly, so humbly, and so wisely, I
suppose."
I sat and listened.
'Do you understand?'
he asked.
"'No,' I
said, 'I don't understand a word, but leave me quite alone.'"
"Ever since
then they've left me in peace, Shatushka."
"And at that time an old woman
who was living in the convent doing penance for prophesying the future,
whispered to me as she was coming out of church, 'What is the mother of
God?"
What do you think?'
"'The great mother,' I answer, 'the hope of
the human race.'"
"'Yes,' she answered, 'the mother of God is the great
mother--the damp earth, and therein lies great joy for men."
"And every
earthly woe and every earthly tear is a joy for us; and when you water
the earth with your tears a foot deep, you will rejoice at everything at
once, and your sorrow will be no more, such is the prophecy.'"
"That word
sank into my heart at the time."
"Since then when I bow down to the ground
at my prayers, I've taken to kissing the earth."
I kiss it and weep.
"And
let me tell you, Shatushka, there's no harm in those tears; and even
if one has no grief, one's tears flow from joy."
"The tears flow of
themselves, that's the truth."
"I used to go out to the shores of the
lake; on one side was our convent and on the other the pointed mountain,
they called it the Peak."
"I used to go up that mountain, facing the east,
fall down to the ground, and weep and weep, and I don't know how long
I wept, and I don't remember or know anything about it."
"I would get up,
and turn back when the sun was setting, it was so big, and splendid and
glorious--do you like looking at the sun, Shatushka?"
"It's beautiful but
sad."
"I would turn to the east again, and the shadow, the shadow of our
mountain was flying like an arrow over our lake, long, long and narrow,
stretching a mile beyond, right up to the island on the lake and cutting
that rocky island right in two, and as it cut it in two, the sun would
set altogether and suddenly all would be darkness."
"And then I used to be
quite miserable, suddenly I used to remember, I'm afraid of the dark,
Shatushka."
"And what I wept for most was my baby....""

""Why, had you one?"""
"And Shatov, who had been listening attentively all
the time, nudged me with his elbow."
"""Why, of course."
"A little rosy baby with tiny little nails, and my only
grief is I can't remember whether it was a boy or a girl."
"Sometimes
I remember it was a boy, and sometimes it was a girl."
"And when he was
born, I wrapped him in cambric and lace, and put pink ribbons on him,
strewed him with flowers, got him ready, said prayers over him."
"I took
him away un-christened and carried him through the forest, and I was
afraid of the forest, and I was frightened, and what I weep for most is
that I had a baby and I never had a husband."""
"""Perhaps you had one?"""
Shatov queried cautiously.
"""You're absurd, Shatushka, with your reflections."
"I had, perhaps I had,
but what's the use of my having had one, if it's just the same as though
I hadn't."
There's an easy riddle for you.
"Guess it!"""
she laughed.
"""Where did you take your baby?"""
"""I took it to the pond,"" she said with a sigh."
Shatov nudged me again.
"""And what if you never had a baby and all this is only a wild dream?"""
"""You ask me a hard question, Shatushka,"" she answered dreamily, without
a trace of surprise at such a question."
"""I can't tell you anything about
that, perhaps I hadn't; I think that's only your curiosity."
"I shan't
leave off crying for him anyway, I couldn't have dreamt it."""
"And big
tears glittered in her eyes."
"""Shatushka, Shatushka, is it true that your
wife ran away from you?"""
"She suddenly put both hands on his shoulders, and looked at him
pityingly."
"""Don't be angry, I feel sick myself."
"Do you know, Shatushka,
I've had a dream: he came to me again, he beckoned me, called me."
"'My
little puss,' he cried to me, 'little puss, come to me!'"
"And I was more
delighted at that 'little puss' than anything; he loves me, I thought."""
"""Perhaps he will come in reality,"" Shatov muttered in an undertone."
"""No, Shatushka, that's a dream...."
He can't come in reality.
"You know
the song:

     'A new fine house I do not crave,
     This tiny cell's enough for me;
     There will I dwell my soul to save
     And ever pray to God for thee.'"
"Ach, Shatushka, Shatushka, my dear, why do you never ask me about
anything?"""
"""Why, you won't tell."
"That's why I don't ask."""
"""I won't tell, I won't tell,"" she answered quickly."
"""You may kill me, I
won't tell."
"You may burn me, I won't tell."
"And whatever I had to bear
I'd never tell, people won't find out!"""
"""There, you see."
"Every one has something of their own,"" Shatov said,
still more softly, his head drooping lower and lower."
"""But if you were to ask perhaps I should tell, perhaps I should!"""
she repeated ecstatically.
"""Why don't you ask?"
"Ask, ask me nicely,
Shatushka, perhaps I shall tell you."
"Entreat me, Shatushka, so that I
shall consent of myself."
"Shatushka, Shatushka!"""
But Shatushka was silent.
There was complete silence lasting a minute.
Tears slowly trickled down her painted cheeks.
"She sat forgetting her
two hands on Shatov's shoulders, but no longer looking at him."
"""Ach, what is it to do with me, and it's a sin."""
"Shatov suddenly got up
from the bench."
"""Get up!"""
"He angrily pulled the bench from under me and put it back
where it stood before."
"""He'll be coming, so we must mind he doesn't guess."
"It's time we were
off."""
"""Ach, you're talking of my footman,"" Marya Timofyevna laughed suddenly."
"""You're afraid of him."
"Well, good-bye, dear visitors, but listen for one
minute, I've something to tell you."
"That Nilitch came here with Filipov,
the landlord, a red beard, and my fellow had flown at me just then, so
the landlord caught hold of him and pulled him about the room while he
shouted 'It's not my fault, I'm suffering for another man's sin!'"
"So
would you believe it, we all burst out laughing....""

""Ach, Timofyevna, why it was I, not the red beard, it was I pulled
him away from you by his hair, this morning; the landlord came the day
before yesterday to make a row; you've mixed it up."""
"""Stay, I really have mixed it up."
Perhaps it was you.
"Why dispute about
trifles?"
"What does it matter to him who it is gives him a beating?"""
"She
laughed."
"""Come along!"""
Shatov pulled me.
"""The gate's creaking, he'll find us and
beat her."""
"And before we had time to run out on to the stairs we heard a drunken
shout and a shower of oaths at the gate."
Shatov let me into his room and locked the door.
"""You'll have to stay a minute if you don't want a scene."
"He's squealing
like a little pig, he must have stumbled over the gate again."
"He falls
flat every time."""
"We didn't get off without a scene, however."
"VI

Shatov stood at the closed door of his room and listened; suddenly he
sprang back."
"""He's coming here, I knew he would,"" he whispered furiously."
"""Now
there'll be no getting rid of him till midnight."""
Several violent thumps of a fist on the door followed.
"""Shatov, Shatov, open!"""
yelled the captain.
"""Shatov, friend!"
"'I have come, to thee to tell thee
     That the sun doth r-r-rise apace,
     That the forest glows and tr-r-rembles
     In... the fire of...his...embrace."
"Tell thee I have waked, God damn thee,
     Wakened under the birch-twigs....'

  (""As it might be under the birch-rods, ha ha!"")"
"'Every little bird...is...thirsty,
     Says I'm going to...have a drink,
     But I don't...know what to drink....'

""Damn his stupid curiosity!"
"Shatov, do you understand how good it is to
be alive!"""
"""Don't answer!"""
Shatov whispered to me again.
"""Open the door!"
"Do you understand that there's something higher than
brawling... in mankind; there are moments of an hon-hon-honourable
man.... Shatov, I'm good; I'll forgive you.... Shatov, damn the
manifestoes, eh?"""
Silence.
"""Do you understand, you ass, that I'm in love, that I've bought a
dress-coat, look, the garb of love, fifteen roubles; a captain's love
calls for the niceties of style.... Open the door!"""
"he roared savagely
all of a sudden, and he began furiously banging with his fists again."
"""Go to hell!"""
Shatov roared suddenly.
"""S-s-slave!"
"Bond-slave, and your sister's a slave, a bondswoman... a
th... th..."
"ief!"""
"""And you sold your sister."""
"""That's a lie!"
I put up with the libel though.
"I could with one word...
do you understand what she is?"""
"""What?"""
Shatov at once drew near the door inquisitively.
"""But will you understand?"""
"""Yes, I shall understand, tell me what?"""
"""I'm not afraid to say!"
"I'm never afraid to say anything in public!..."""
"""You not afraid?"
"A likely story,"" said Shatov, taunting him, and nodding
to me to listen."
"""Me afraid?"""
"""Yes, I think you are."""
"""Me afraid?"""
"""Well then, tell away if you're not afraid of your master's whip....
You're a coward, though you are a captain!"""
"""I..."
"I... she's... she's..."" faltered Lebyadkin in a voice shaking with
excitement."
"""Well?"""
Shatov put his ear to the door.
"A silence followed, lasting at least half a minute."
"""Sc-ou-oundrel!"""
"came from the other side of the door at last, and the
captain hurriedly beat a retreat downstairs, puffing like a samovar,
stumbling on every step."
"""Yes, he's a sly one, and won't give himself away even when he's drunk."""
Shatov moved away from the door.
"""What's it all about?"""
I asked.
"Shatov waved aside the question, opened the door and began listening
on the stairs again."
"He listened a long while, and even stealthily
descended a few steps."
At last he came back.
"""There's nothing to be heard; he isn't beating her; he must have flopped
down at once to go to sleep."
"It's time for you to go."""
"""Listen, Shatov, what am I to gather from all this?"""
"""Oh, gather what you like!"""
"he answered in a weary and disgusted voice,
and he sat down to his writing-table."
I went away.
"An improbable idea was growing stronger and stronger in my
mind."
"I thought of the next day with distress....


VII

This ""next day,"" the very Sunday which was to decide Stepan
Trofimovitch's fate irrevocably, was one of the most memorable days in
my chronicle."
"It was a day of surprises, a day that solved past riddles
and suggested new ones, a day of startling revelations, and still more
hopeless perplexity."
"In the morning, as the reader is already aware, I
had by Varvara Petrovna's particular request to accompany my friend on
his visit to her, and at three o'clock in the afternoon I had to be with
Lizaveta Nikolaevna in order to tell her--I did not know what--and to
assist her--I did not know how."
"And meanwhile it all ended as no one
could have expected."
"In a word, it was a day of wonderful coincidences."
"To begin with, when Stepan Trofimovitch and I arrived at Varvara
Petrovna's at twelve o'clock punctually, the time she had fixed, we did
not find her at home; she had not yet come back from church."
"My poor
friend was so disposed, or, more accurately speaking, so indisposed that
this circumstance crushed him at once; he sank almost helpless into
an arm-chair in the drawing-room."
"I suggested a glass of water; but in
spite of his pallor and the trembling of his hands, he refused it
with dignity."
"His get-up for the occasion was, by the way, extremely
recherché: a shirt of batiste and embroidered, almost fit for a ball, a
white tie, a new hat in his hand, new straw-coloured gloves, and even a
suspicion of scent."
"We had hardly sat down when Shatov was shown in by
the butler, obviously also by official invitation."
"Stepan Trofimovitch
was rising to shake hands with him, but Shatov, after looking
attentively at us both, turned away into a corner, and sat down there
without even nodding to us."
"Stepan Trofimovitch looked at me in dismay
again."
We sat like this for some minutes longer in complete silence.
"Stepan
Trofimovitch suddenly began whispering something to me very quickly,
but I could not catch it; and indeed, he was so agitated himself that he
broke off without finishing."
"The butler came in once more, ostensibly to
set something straight on the table, more probably to take a look at us."
"Shatov suddenly addressed him with a loud question:

""Alexey Yegorytch, do you know whether Darya Pavlovna has gone with
her?"""
"""Varvara Petrovna was pleased to drive to the cathedral alone, and Darya
Pavlovna was pleased to remain in her room upstairs, being indisposed,""
Alexey Yegorytch announced formally and reprovingly."
"My poor friend again stole a hurried and agitated glance at me, so
that at last I turned away from him."
"Suddenly a carriage rumbled at the
entrance, and some commotion at a distance in the house made us aware
of the lady's return."
"We all leapt up from our easy chairs, but again
a surprise awaited us; we heard the noise of many footsteps, so our
hostess must have returned not alone, and this certainly was rather
strange, since she had fixed that time herself."
"Finally, we heard some
one come in with strange rapidity as though running, in a way that
Varvara Petrovna could not have come in."
"And, all at once she almost
flew into the room, panting and extremely agitated."
"After her a little
later and much more quickly Lizaveta Nikolaevna came in, and with her,
hand in hand, Marya Timofyevna Lebyadkin!"
"If I had seen this in my
dreams, even then I should not have believed it."
"To explain their utterly unexpected appearance, I must go back an
hour and describe more in detail an extraordinary adventure which had
befallen Varvara Petrovna in church."
"In the first place almost the whole town, that is, of course, all of the
upper stratum of society, were assembled in the cathedral."
"It was known
that the governor's wife was to make her appearance there for the
first time since her arrival amongst us."
"I must mention that there were
already rumours that she was a free-thinker, and a follower of ""the new
principles."""
"All the ladies were also aware that she would be dressed
with magnificence and extraordinary elegance."
"And so the costumes of our
ladies were elaborate and gorgeous for the occasion."
"Only Varvara Petrovna was modestly dressed in black as she always was,
and had been for the last four years."
"She had taken her usual place in
church in the first row on the left, and a footman in livery had put
down a velvet cushion for her to kneel on; everything in fact, had been
as usual."
"But it was noticed, too, that all through the service she
prayed with extreme fervour."
"It was even asserted afterwards when people
recalled it, that she had had tears in her eyes."
"The service was over at
last, and our chief priest, Father Pavel, came out to deliver a solemn
sermon."
We liked his sermons and thought very highly of them.
"We used
even to try to persuade him to print them, but he never could make up
his mind to."
On this occasion the sermon was a particularly long one.
"And behold, during the sermon a lady drove up to the church in an old
fashioned hired droshky, that is, one in which the lady could only sit
sideways, holding on to the driver's sash, shaking at every jolt like a
blade of grass in the breeze."
"Such droshkys are still to be seen in our
town."
"Stopping at the corner of the cathedral--for there were a number
of carriages, and mounted police too, at the gates--the lady sprang out
of the droshky and handed the driver four kopecks in silver."
"""Isn't it enough, Vanya?"""
"she cried, seeing his grimace."
"""It's all I've
got,"" she added plaintively."
"""Well, there, bless you."
"I took you without fixing the price,"" said the
driver with a hopeless gesture, and looking at her he added as though
reflecting:

""And it would be a sin to take advantage of you too."""
"Then, thrusting his leather purse into his bosom, he touched up his
horse and drove off, followed by the jeers of the drivers standing near."
"Jeers, and wonder too, followed the lady as she made her way to the
cathedral gates, between the carriages and the footmen waiting for
their masters to come out."
"And indeed, there certainly was something
extraordinary and surprising to every one in such a person's suddenly
appearing in the street among people."
"She was painfully thin and she
limped, she was heavily powdered and rouged; her long neck was quite
bare, she had neither kerchief nor pelisse; she had nothing on but an
old dark dress in spite of the cold and windy, though bright, September
day."
"She was bareheaded, and her hair was twisted up into a tiny knot,
and on the right side of it was stuck an artificial rose, such as are
used to dedicate cherubs sold in Palm week."
"I had noticed just such a
one with a wreath of paper roses in a corner under the ikons when I was
at Marya Timofyevna's the day before."
"To put a finishing-touch to it,
though the lady walked with modestly downcast eyes there was a sly and
merry smile on her face."
"If she had lingered a moment longer, she would
perhaps not have been allowed to enter the cathedral."
"But she succeeded
in slipping by, and entering the building, gradually pressed forward."
"Though it was half-way through the sermon, and the dense crowd that
filled the cathedral was listening to it with absorbed and silent
attention, yet several pairs of eyes glanced with curiosity and
amazement at the new-comer."
"She sank on to the floor, bowed her painted
face down to it, lay there a long time, unmistakably weeping; but
raising her head again and getting up from her knees, she soon
recovered, and was diverted."
"Gaily and with evident and intense
enjoyment she let her eyes rove over the faces, and over the walls
of the cathedral."
"She looked with particular curiosity at some of the
ladies, even standing on tip-toe to look at them, and even laughed once
or twice, giggling strangely."
"But the sermon was over, and they brought
out the cross."
"The governor's wife was the first to go up to the cross,
but she stopped short two steps from it, evidently wishing to make way
for Varvara Petrovna, who, on her side, moved towards it quite directly
as though she noticed no one in front of her."
"There was an obvious and,
in its way, clever malice implied in this extraordinary act of deference
on the part of the governor's wife; every one felt this; Varvara
Petrovna must have felt it too; but she went on as before, apparently
noticing no one, and with the same unfaltering air of dignity kissed the
cross, and at once turned to leave the cathedral."
"A footman in livery
cleared the way for her, though every one stepped back spontaneously to
let her pass."
"But just as she was going out, in the porch the closely
packed mass of people blocked the way for a moment."
"Varvara Petrovna
stood still, and suddenly a strange, extraordinary creature, the woman
with the paper rose on her head, squeezed through the people, and
fell on her knees before her."
"Varvara Petrovna, who was not easily
disconcerted, especially in public, looked at her sternly and with
dignity."
"I hasten to observe here, as briefly as possible, that though Varvara
Petrovna had become, it was said, excessively careful and even stingy,
yet sometimes she was not sparing of money, especially for benevolent
objects."
She was a member of a charitable society in the capital.
"In
the last famine year she had sent five hundred roubles to the chief
committee for the relief of the sufferers, and people talked of it in
the town."
"Moreover, just before the appointment of the new governor, she
had been on the very point of founding a local committee of ladies to
assist the poorest mothers in the town and in the province."
"She
was severely censured among us for ambition; but Varvara Petrovna's
well-known strenuousness and, at the same time, her persistence nearly
triumphed over all obstacles."
"The society was almost formed, and the
original idea embraced a wider and wider scope in the enthusiastic mind
of the foundress."
"She was already dreaming of founding a similar society
in Moscow, and the gradual expansion of its influence over all the
provinces of Russia."
"And now, with the sudden change of governor,
everything was at a standstill; and the new governor's wife had, it was
said, already uttered in society some biting, and, what was worse, apt
and sensible remarks about the impracticability of the fundamental idea
of such a committee, which was, with additions of course, repeated to
Varvara Petrovna."
"God alone knows the secrets of men's hearts; but I
imagine that Varvara Petrovna stood still now at the very cathedral
gates positively with a certain pleasure, knowing that the governor's
wife and, after her, all the congregation, would have to pass by
immediately, and ""let her see for herself how little I care what
she thinks, and what pointed things she says about the vanity of my
benevolence."
"So much for all of you!"""
"""What is it my dear?"
"What are you asking?"""
"said Varvara Petrovna,
looking more attentively at the kneeling woman before her, who gazed at
her with a fearfully panic-stricken, shame-faced, but almost reverent
expression, and suddenly broke into the same strange giggle."
"""What does she want?"
"Who is she?"""
Varvara Petrovna bent an imperious and inquiring gaze on all around her.
Every one was silent.
"""You are unhappy?"
"You are in need of help?"""
"""I am in need...."
"I have come..."" faltered the ""unhappy"" creature, in a
voice broken with emotion."
"""I have come only to kiss your hand....""

Again she giggled."
"With the childish look with which little children
caress someone, begging for a favour, she stretched forward to seize
Varvara Petrovna's hand, but, as though panic-stricken, drew her hands
back."
"""Is that all you have come for?"""
"said Varvara Petrovna, with a
compassionate smile; but at once she drew her mother-of-pearl purse out
of her pocket, took out a ten-rouble note and gave it to the unknown."
The latter took it.
"Varvara Petrovna was much interested and evidently
did not look upon her as an ordinary low-class beggar."
"""I say, she gave her ten roubles!"""
someone said in the crowd.
"""Let me kiss your hand,"" faltered the unknown, holding tight in the
fingers of her left hand the corner of the ten-rouble note, which
fluttered in the draught."
"Varvara Petrovna frowned slightly, and with
a serious, almost severe, face held out her hand."
"The cripple kissed it
with reverence."
Her grateful eyes shone with positive ecstasy.
"At that
moment the governor's wife came up, and a whole crowd of ladies and high
officials flocked after her."
"The governor's wife was forced to stand
still for a moment in the crush; many people stopped."
"""You are trembling."
"Are you cold?"""
"Varvara Petrovna observed suddenly,
and flinging off her pelisse which a footman caught in mid-air, she took
from her own shoulders a very expensive black shawl, and with her own
hands wrapped it round the bare neck of the still kneeling woman."
"""But get up, get up from your knees I beg you!"""
The woman got up.
"""Where do you live?"
"Is it possible no one knows where she lives?"""
Varvara Petrovna glanced round impatiently again.
"But the crowd was
different now: she saw only the faces of acquaintances, people in
society, surveying the scene, some with severe astonishment, others with
sly curiosity and at the same time guileless eagerness for a sensation,
while others positively laughed."
"""I believe her name's Lebyadkin,"" a good-natured person volunteered at
last in answer to Varvara Petrovna."
"It was our respectable and respected
merchant Andreev, a man in spectacles with a grey beard, wearing Russian
dress and holding a high round hat in his hands."
"""They live in the
Filipovs' house in Bogoyavlensky Street."""
"""Lebyadkin?"
Filipovs' house?
I have heard something....
"Thank you, Nikon
Semyonitch."
"But who is this Lebyadkin?"""
"""He calls himself a captain, a man, it must be said, not over careful
in his behaviour."
And no doubt this is his sister.
"She must have escaped
from under control,"" Nikon Semyonitch went on, dropping his voice, and
glancing significantly at Varvara Petrovna."
"""I understand."
"Thank you, Nikon Semyonitch."
Your name is Mlle.
"Lebyadkin?"""
"""No, my name's not Lebyadkin."""
"""Then perhaps your brother's name is Lebyadkin?"""
"""My brother's name is Lebyadkin."""
"""This is what I'll do, I'll take you with me now, my dear, and you shall
be driven from me to your family."
"Would you like to go with me?"""
"""Ach, I should!"""
cried Mlle.
"Lebyadkin, clasping her hands."
"""Auntie, auntie, take me with you too!"""
"the voice of Lizaveta Nikolaevna
cried suddenly."
"I must observe that Lizaveta Nikolaevna had come to the cathedral with
the governor's wife, while Praskovya Ivanovna had by the doctor's
orders gone for a drive in her carriage, taking Mavriky Nikolaevitch
to entertain her."
"Liza suddenly left the governor's wife and ran up to
Varvara Petrovna."
"""My dear, you know I'm always glad to have you, but what will your
mother say?"""
"Varvara Petrovna began majestically, but she became
suddenly confused, noticing Liza's extraordinary agitation."
"""Auntie, auntie, I must come with you!"""
"Liza implored, kissing Varvara
Petrovna."
"_""Mais qu'avez vous donc, Lise?"
"""_ the governor's wife asked with
expressive wonder."
"""Ah, forgive me, darling, _chère cousine,_ I'm going to auntie's."""
"Liza turned in passing to her unpleasantly surprised _chère cousine_, and
kissed her twice."
"""And tell maman to follow me to auntie's directly; maman meant, fully
meant to come and see you, she said so this morning herself, I forgot to
tell you,"" Liza pattered on."
"""I beg your pardon, don't be angry, _Julie,
chère...cousine...._Auntie, I'm ready!"""
"""If you don't take me with you, auntie, I'll run after your carriage,
screaming,"" she whispered rapidly and despairingly in Varvara Petrovna's
ear; it was lucky that no one heard."
"Varvara Petrovna positively
staggered back, and bent her penetrating gaze on the mad girl."
"That gaze
settled everything."
She made up her mind to take Liza with her.
"""We must put an end to this!"""
broke from her lips.
"""Very well, I'll
take you with pleasure, Liza,"" she added aloud, ""if Yulia Mihailovna
is willing to let you come, of course."""
"With a candid air and
straightforward dignity she addressed the governor's wife directly."
"""Oh, certainly, I don't want to deprive her of such a pleasure
especially as I am myself..."" Yulia Mihailovna lisped with amazing
affability--""I myself... know well what a fantastic, wilful little head
it is!"""
Yulia Mihailovna gave a charming smile.
"""I thank you extremely,"" said Varvara Petrovna, with a courteous and
dignified bow."
"""And I am the more gratified,"" Yulia Mihailovna went on, lisping almost
rapturously, flushing all over with agreeable excitement, ""that, apart
from the pleasure of being with you Liza should be carried away by such
an excellent, I may say lofty, feeling... of compassion..."" (she
glanced at the ""unhappy creature"") ""and... and at the very portal of the
temple....""

""Such a feeling does you honour,"" Varvara Petrovna approved
magnificently."
"Yulia Mihailovna impulsively held out her hand and
Varvara Petrovna with perfect readiness touched it with her fingers."
"The
general effect was excellent, the faces of some of those present beamed
with pleasure, some bland and insinuating smiles were to be seen."
"In short it was made manifest to every one in the town that it was not
Yulia Mihailovna who had up till now neglected Varvara Petrovna in not
calling upon her, but on the contrary that Varvara Petrovna had ""kept
Yulia Mihailovna within bounds at a distance, while the latter would
have hastened to pay her a visit, going on foot perhaps if necessary,
had she been fully assured that Varvara Petrovna would not turn her
away."""
And Varvara Petrovna's prestige was enormously increased.
"""Get in, my dear."""
Varvara Petrovna motioned Mlle.
"Lebyadkin towards the
carriage which had driven up."
"The ""unhappy creature"" hurried gleefully to the carriage door, and there
the footman lifted her in."
"""What!"
"You're lame!"""
"cried Varvara Petrovna, seeming quite alarmed,
and she turned pale."
"(Every one noticed it at the time, but did not
understand it.)"
The carriage rolled away.
"Varvara Petrovna's house was very near
the cathedral."
"Liza told me afterwards that Miss Lebyadkin laughed
hysterically for the three minutes that the drive lasted, while Varvara
Petrovna sat ""as though in a mesmeric sleep."""
Liza's own expression.
"CHAPTER V. THE SUBTLE SERPENT


I

VARVARA PETROVNA rang the bell and threw herself into an easy chair by
the window."
"""Sit here, my dear."""
"She motioned Marya Timofyevna to a seat in the
middle of the room, by a large round table."
"""Stepan Trofimovitch,
what is the meaning of this?"
"See, see, look at this woman, what is the
meaning of it?"""
"""I..."
"I..."" faltered Stepan Trofimovitch."
But a footman came in.
"""A cup of coffee at once, we must have it as quickly as possible!"
"Keep
the horses!"""
"_""Mais, chère et excellente amie, dans quelle inquiétude...""_ Stepan
Trofimovitch exclaimed in a dying voice."
"""Ach!"
French!
French!
"I can see at once that it's the highest society,""
cried Marya Timofyevna, clapping her hands, ecstatically preparing
herself to listen to a conversation in French."
"Varvara Petrovna stared
at her almost in dismay."
"We all sat in silence, waiting to see how it would end."
"Shatov did not
lift up his head, and Stepan Trofimovitch was overwhelmed with confusion
as though it were all his fault; the perspiration stood out on his
temples."
"I glanced at Liza (she was sitting in the corner almost beside
Shatov)."
"Her eyes darted keenly from Varvara Petrovna to the cripple and
back again; her lips were drawn into a smile, but not a pleasant
one."
Varvara Petrovna saw that smile.
"Meanwhile Marya Timofyevna was
absolutely transported."
"With evident enjoyment and without a trace
of embarrassment she stared at Varvara Petrovna's beautiful
drawing-room--the furniture, the carpets, the pictures on the walls, the
old-fashioned painted ceiling, the great bronze crucifix in the corner,
the china lamp, the albums, the objects on the table."
"""And you're here, too, Shatushka!"""
she cried suddenly.
"""Only fancy, I
saw you a long time ago, but I thought it couldn't be you!"
"How could you
come here!"""
And she laughed gaily.
"""You know this woman?"""
"said Varvara Petrovna, turning to him at once."
"""I know her,"" muttered Shatov."
"He seemed about to move from his chair,
but remained sitting."
"""What do you know of her?"
"Make haste, please!"""
"""Oh, well..."" he stammered with an incongruous smile."
"""You see for
yourself....""

""What do I see?"
"Come now, say something!"""
"""She lives in the same house as I do... with her brother... an officer."""
"""Well?"""
Shatov stammered again.
"""It's not worth talking about..."" he muttered, and relapsed into
determined silence."
He positively flushed with determination.
"""Of course one can expect nothing else from you,"" said Varvara Petrovna
indignantly."
"It was clear to her now that they all knew something and,
at the same time, that they were all scared, that they were evading her
questions, and anxious to keep something from her."
"The footman came in and brought her, on a little silver tray, the cup of
coffee she had so specially ordered, but at a sign from her moved with
it at once towards Marya Timofyevna."
"""You were very cold just now, my dear; make haste and drink it and get
warm."""
"_""Merci."
"""_

Marya Timofyevna took the cup and at once went off into a giggle
at having said _merci_ to the footman."
"But meeting Varvara Petrovna's
reproving eyes, she was overcome with shyness and put the cup on the
table."
"""Auntie, surely you're not angry?"""
"she faltered with a sort of flippant
playfulness."
"""Wh-a-a-t?"""
"Varvara Petrovna started, and drew herself up in her chair."
"""I'm not your aunt."
"What are you thinking of?"""
"Marya Timofyevna, not expecting such an angry outburst, began trembling
all over in little convulsive shudders, as though she were in a fit, and
sank back in her chair."
"""I..."
"I... thought that was the proper way,"" she faltered, gazing
open-eyed at Varvara Petrovna."
"""Liza called you that."""
"""What Liza?"""
"""Why, this young lady here,"" said Marya Timofyevna, pointing with her
finger."
"""So she's Liza already?"""
"""You called her that yourself just now,"" said Marya Timofyevna growing
a little bolder."
"""And I dreamed of a beauty like that,"" she added,
laughing, as it were accidentally."
"Varvara Petrovna reflected, and grew calmer, she even smiled faintly at
Marya Timofyevna's last words; the latter, catching her smile, got up
from her chair, and limping, went timidly towards her."
"""Take it."
I forgot to give it back.
"Don't be angry with my rudeness."""
"She took from her shoulders the black shawl that Varvara Petrovna had
wrapped round her."
"""Put it on again at once, and you can keep it always."
"Go and sit down,
drink your coffee, and please don't be afraid of me, my dear, don't
worry yourself."
"I am beginning to understand you."""
"_""Chère amie...""_ Stepan Trofimovitch ventured again."
"""Ach, Stepan Trofimovitch, it's bewildering enough without you."
"You
might at least spare me...."
"Please ring that bell there, near you, to
the maid's room."""
A silence followed.
"Her eyes strayed irritably and suspiciously over all
our faces."
"Agasha, her favourite maid, came in."
"""Bring me my check shawl, the one I bought in Geneva."
"What's Darya
Pavlovna doing?"""
"""She's not very well, madam."""
"""Go and ask her to come here."
"Say that I want her particularly, even if
she's not well."""
"At that instant there was again, as before, an unusual noise of steps
and voices in the next room, and suddenly Praskovya Ivanovna, panting
and ""distracted,"" appeared in the doorway."
"She was leaning on the arm of
Mavriky Nikolaevitch."
"""Ach, heavens, I could scarcely drag myself here."
"Liza, you mad girl,
how you treat your mother!"""
"she squeaked, concentrating in that squeak,
as weak and irritable people are wont to do, all her accumulated
irritability."
"""Varvara Petrovna, I've come for my daughter!"""
"Varvara Petrovna looked at her from under her brows, half rose to meet
her, and scarcely concealing her vexation brought out: ""Good morning,
Praskovya Ivanovna, please be seated, I knew you would come!"""
"II

There could be nothing surprising to Praskovya Ivanovna in such a
reception."
"Varvara Petrovna had from childhood upwards treated her
old school friend tyrannically, and under a show of friendship almost
contemptuously."
And this was an exceptional occasion too.
"During the
last few days there had almost been a complete rupture between the two
households, as I have mentioned incidentally already."
"The reason of this
rupture was still a mystery to Varvara Petrovna, which made it all
the more offensive; but the chief cause of offence was that Praskovya
Ivanovna had succeeded in taking up an extraordinarily supercilious
attitude towards Varvara Petrovna."
"Varvara Petrovna was wounded of
course, and meanwhile some strange rumours had reached her which also
irritated her extremely, especially by their vagueness."
"Varvara Petrovna
was of a direct and proudly frank character, somewhat slap-dash in her
methods, indeed, if the expression is permissible."
"There was nothing
she detested so much as secret and mysterious insinuations, she always
preferred war in the open."
"Anyway, the two ladies had not met for five
days."
"The last visit had been paid by Varvara Petrovna, who had come
back from ""that Drozdov woman"" offended and perplexed."
"I can say with
certainty that Praskovya Ivanovna had come on this occasion with the
naïve conviction that Varvara Petrovna would, for some reason, be sure
to stand in awe of her."
"This was evident from the very expression of her
face."
"Evidently too, Varvara Petrovna was always possessed by a demon of
haughty pride whenever she had the least ground for suspecting that she
was for some reason supposed to be humiliated."
"Like many weak people,
who for a long time allow themselves to be insulted without resenting
it, Praskovya Ivanovna showed an extraordinary violence in her attack at
the first favourable opportunity."
"It is true that she was not well, and
always became more irritable in illness."
"I must add finally, that our
presence in the drawing-room could hardly be much check to the two
ladies who had been friends from childhood, if a quarrel had broken out
between them."
"We were looked upon as friends of the family, and almost
as their subjects."
I made that reflection with some alarm at the time.
"Stepan Trofimovitch, who had not sat down since the entrance of Varvara
Petrovna, sank helplessly into an arm-chair on hearing Praskovya
Ivanovna's squeal, and tried to catch my eye with a look of despair."
"Shatov turned sharply in his chair, and growled something to himself."
I believe he meant to get up and go away.
"Liza rose from her chair but
sank back again at once without even paying befitting attention to her
mother's squeal--not from ""waywardness,"" but obviously because she
was entirely absorbed by some other overwhelming impression."
"She was
looking absent-mindedly into the air, no longer noticing even Marya
Timofyevna."
"III

""Ach, here!"""
"Praskovya Ivanovna indicated an easy chair near the table
and sank heavily into it with the assistance of Mavriky Nikolaevitch."
"""I wouldn't have sat down in your house, my lady, if it weren't for my
legs,"" she added in a breaking voice."
"Varvara Petrovna raised her head a little, and with an expression of
suffering pressed the fingers of her right hand to her right temple,
evidently in acute pain _(tic douloureux)_."
"""Why so, Praskovya Ivanovna; why wouldn't you sit down in my house?"
"I
possessed your late husband's sincere friendship all his life; and you
and I used to play with our dolls at school together as girls."""
Praskovya Ivanovna waved her hands.
"""I knew that was coming!"
"You always begin about the school when you want
to reproach me--that's your way."
"But to my thinking that's only fine
talk."
"I can't stand the school you're always talking about."""
"""You've come in rather a bad temper, I'm afraid; how are your legs?"
"Here
they're bringing you some coffee, please have some, drink it and don't
be cross."""
"""Varvara Petrovna, you treat me as though I were a child."
"I won't have
any coffee, so there!"""
And she pettishly waved away the footman who was bringing her coffee.
(All the others refused coffee too except Mavriky Nikolaevitch and me.
"Stepan Trofimovitch took it, but put it aside on the table."
"Though Marya
Timofyevna was very eager to have another cup and even put out her hand
to take it, on second thoughts she refused it ceremoniously, and was
obviously pleased with herself for doing so.)"
Varvara Petrovna gave a wry smile.
"""I'll tell you what it is, Praskovya Ivanovna, my friend, you must
have taken some fancy into your head again, and that's why you've come."
You've simply lived on fancies all your life.
"You flew into a fury at
the mere mention of our school; but do you remember how you came and
persuaded all the class that a hussar called Shablykin had proposed to
you, and how Mme."
Lefebure proved on the spot you were lying.
"Yet you
weren't lying, you were simply imagining it all to amuse yourself."
"Come,
tell me, what is it now?"
"What are you fancying now; what is it vexes
you?"""
"""And you fell in love with the priest who used to teach us scripture at
school--so much for you, since you've such a spiteful memory."
"Ha ha ha!"""
She laughed viciously and went off into a fit of coughing.
"""Ah, you've not forgotten the priest then..."" said Varvara Petrovna,
looking at her vindictively."
Her face turned green.
"Praskovya Ivanovna suddenly assumed a dignified
air."
"""I'm in no laughing mood now, madam."
"Why have you drawn my daughter
into your scandals in the face of the whole town?"
"That's what I've come
about."""
"""My scandals?"""
Varvara Petrovna drew herself up menacingly.
"""Maman, I entreat you too, to restrain yourself,"" Lizaveta Nikolaevna
brought out suddenly."
"""What's that you say?"""
"The maman was on the point of breaking into a
squeal again, but catching her daughter's flashing eye, she subsided
suddenly."
"""How could you talk about scandal, maman?"""
"cried Liza, flushing red."
"""I came of my own accord with Yulia Mihailovna's permission, because I
wanted to learn this unhappy woman's story and to be of use to her."""
"""This unhappy woman's story!"""
"Praskovya Ivanovna drawled with a spiteful
laugh."
"""Is it your place to mix yourself up with such 'stories.'"
"Ach,
enough of your tyrannising!"""
She turned furiously to Varvara Petrovna.
"""I don't know whether it's true or not, they say you keep the whole town
in order, but it seems your turn has come at last."""
Varvara Petrovna sat straight as an arrow ready to fly from the bow.
"For
ten seconds she looked sternly and immovably at Praskovya Ivanovna."
"""Well, Praskovya, you must thank God that all here present are our
friends,"" she said at last with ominous composure."
"""You've said a great
deal better unsaid."""
"""But I'm not so much afraid of what the world will say, my lady, as
some people."
"It's you who, under a show of pride, are trembling at what
people will say."
"And as for all here being your friends, it's better for
you than if strangers had been listening."""
"""Have you grown wiser during this last week?"""
"""It's not that I've grown wiser, but simply that the truth has come out
this week."""
"""What truth has come out this week?"
"Listen, Praskovya Ivanovna, don't
irritate me."
"Explain to me this minute, I beg you as a favour, what
truth has come out and what do you mean by that?"""
"""Why there it is, sitting before you!"""
"and Praskovya Ivanovna suddenly
pointed at Marya Timofyevna with that desperate determination which
takes no heed of consequences, if only it can make an impression at
the moment."
"Marya Timofyevna, who had watched her all the time with
light-hearted curiosity, laughed exultingly at the sight of the wrathful
guest's finger pointed impetuously at her, and wriggled gleefully in her
easy chair."
"""God Almighty have mercy on us, they've all gone crazy!"""
"exclaimed
Varvara Petrovna, and turning pale she sank back in her chair."
She turned so pale that it caused some commotion.
"Stepan Trofimovitch
was the first to rush up to her."
"I drew near also; even Liza got up from
her seat, though she did not come forward."
"But the most alarmed of all
was Praskovya Ivanovna herself."
"She uttered a scream, got up as far as
she could and almost wailed in a lachrymose voice:

""Varvara Petrovna, dear, forgive me for my wicked foolishness!"
"Give her
some water, somebody."""
"""Don't whimper, please, Praskovya Ivanovna, and leave me alone,
gentlemen, please, I don't want any water!"""
"Varvara Petrovna pronounced
in a firm though low voice, with blanched lips."
"""Varvara Petrovna, my dear,"" Praskovya Ivanovna went on, a little
reassured, ""though I am to blame for my reckless words, what's upset me
more than anything are these anonymous letters that some low creatures
keep bombarding me with; they might write to you, since it concerns you,
but I've a daughter!"""
"Varvara Petrovna looked at her in silence, with wide-open eyes,
listening with wonder."
"At that moment a side-door in the corner opened
noiselessly, and Darya Pavlovna made her appearance."
"She stood still and
looked round."
She was struck by our perturbation.
"Probably she did not
at first distinguish Marya Timofyevna, of whose presence she had not
been informed."
"Stepan Trofimovitch was the first to notice her; he made
a rapid movement, turned red, and for some reason proclaimed in a loud
voice: ""Darya Pavlovna!"""
so that all eyes turned on the new-comer.
"""Oh, is this your Darya Pavlovna!"""
cried Marya Timofyevna.
"""Well,
Shatushka, your sister's not like you."
"How can my fellow call such a
charmer the serf-wench Dasha?"""
"Meanwhile Darya Pavlovna had gone up to Varvara Petrovna, but struck
by Marya Timofyevna's exclamation she turned quickly and stopped just
before her chair, looking at the imbecile with a long fixed gaze."
"""Sit down, Dasha,"" Varvara Petrovna brought out with terrifying
composure."
"""Nearer, that's right."
"You can see this woman, sitting down."
"Do you know her?"""
"""I have never seen her,"" Dasha answered quietly, and after a pause she
added at once:

""She must be the invalid sister of Captain Lebyadkin."""
"""And it's the first time I've set eyes on you, my love, though I've been
interested and wanted to know you a long time, for I see how
well-bred you are in every movement you make,"" Marya Timofyevna cried
enthusiastically."
"""And though my footman swears at you, can such a
well-educated charming person as you really have stolen money from
him?"
"For you are sweet, sweet, sweet, I tell you that from myself!"""
"she
concluded, enthusiastically waving her hand."
"""Can you make anything of it?"""
"Varvara Petrovna asked with proud
dignity."
"""I understand it....""

""Have you heard about the money?"""
"""No doubt it's the money that I undertook at Nikolay Vsyevolodovitch's
request to hand over to her brother, Captain Lebyadkin."""
A silence followed.
"""Did Nikolay Vsyevolodovitch himself ask you to do so?"""
"""He was very anxious to send that money, three hundred roubles, to Mr.
Lebyadkin."
"And as he didn't know his address, but only knew that he
was to be in our town, he charged me to give it to Mr. Lebyadkin if he
came."""
"""What is the money... lost?"
"What was this woman speaking about just
now?"""
"""That I don't know."
"I've heard before that Mr. Lebyadkin says I didn't
give him all the money, but I don't understand his words."
"There were
three hundred roubles and I sent him three hundred roubles."""
Darya Pavlovna had almost completely regained her composure.
"And it was
difficult, I may mention, as a rule, to astonish the girl or ruffle her
calm for long--whatever she might be feeling."
"She brought out all her
answers now without haste, replied immediately to every question with
accuracy, quietly, smoothly, and without a trace of the sudden emotion
she had shown at first, or the slightest embarrassment which might
have suggested a consciousness of guilt."
"Varvara Petrovna's eyes were
fastened upon her all the time she was speaking."
"Varvara Petrovna
thought for a minute:

""If,"" she pronounced at last firmly, evidently addressing all present,
though she only looked at Dasha, ""if Nikolay Vsyevolodovitch
did not appeal even to me but asked you to do this for him,
he must have had his reasons for doing so."
"I don't consider I have
any right to inquire into them, if they are kept secret from me."
"But the
very fact of your having taken part in the matter reassures me on that
score, be sure of that, Darya, in any case."
"But you see, my dear, you
may, through ignorance of the world, have quite innocently done
something imprudent; and you did so when you undertook to have dealings
with a low character."
"The rumours spread by this rascal show what a
mistake you made."
"But I will find out about him, and as it is my task to
protect you, I shall know how to defend you."
"But now all this must be
put a stop to."""
"""The best thing to do,"" said Marya Timofyevna, popping up from her
chair, ""is to send him to the footmen's room when he comes."
"Let him
sit on the benches there and play cards with them while we sit here and
drink coffee."
"We might send him a cup of coffee too, but I have a great
contempt for him."""
And she wagged her head expressively.
"""We must put a stop to this,"" Varvara Petrovna repeated, listening
attentively to Marya Timofyevna."
"""Ring, Stepan Trofimovitch, I beg you."""
"Stepan Trofimovitch rang, and suddenly stepped forward, all excitement."
"""If... if..."" he faltered feverishly, flushing, breaking off and
stuttering, ""if I too have heard the most revolting story, or rather
slander, it was with utter indignation..._enfin c'est un homme perdu, et
quelque chose comme un forçat evadé...._""

He broke down and could not go on."
"Varvara Petrovna, screwing up her
eyes, looked him up and down."
The ceremonious butler Alexey Yegorytch came in.
"""The carriage,"" Varvara Petrovna ordered."
"""And you, Alexey Yegorytch,
get ready to escort Miss Lebyadkin home; she will give you the address
herself."""
"""Mr. Lebyadkin has been waiting for her for some time downstairs, and
has been begging me to announce him."""
"""That's impossible, Varvara Petrovna!"""
"and Mavriky Nikolaevitch, who had
sat all the time in unbroken silence, suddenly came forward in alarm."
"""If I may speak, he is not a man who can be admitted into society."
"He... he... he's an impossible person, Varvara Petrovna!"""
"""Wait a moment,"" said Varvara Petrovna to Alexey Yegorytch, and he
disappeared at once."
"_""C'est un homme malhonnête et je crois même que c'est un forçat evadé
ou quelque chose dans ce genre,""_ Stepan Trofimovitch muttered again, and
again he flushed red and broke off."
"""Liza, it's time we were going,"" announced Praskovya Ivanovna
disdainfully, getting up from her seat."
"She seemed sorry that in her
alarm she had called herself a fool."
"While Darya Pavlovna was speaking,
she listened, pressing her lips superciliously."
"But what struck me most
was the expression of Lizaveta Nikolaevna from the moment Darya Pavlovna
had come in."
"There was a gleam of hatred and hardly disguised contempt
in her eyes."
"""Wait one minute, Praskovya Ivanovna, I beg you."""
"Varvara Petrovna
detained her, still with the same exaggerated composure."
"""Kindly sit
down."
"I intend to speak out, and your legs are bad."
"That's right, thank
you."
I lost my temper just now and uttered some impatient words.
"Be so
good as to forgive me."
"I behaved foolishly and I'm the first to regret
it, because I like fairness in everything."
"Losing your temper too,
of course, you spoke of certain anonymous letters."
"Every anonymous
communication is deserving of contempt, just because it's not signed."
"If
you think differently I'm sorry for you."
"In any case, if I were in your
place, I would not pry into such dirty corners, I would not soil my
hands with it."
But you have soiled yours.
"However, since you have
begun on the subject yourself, I must tell you that six days ago I too
received a clownish anonymous letter."
"In it some rascal informs me that
Nikolay Vsyevolodovitch has gone out of his mind, and that I have reason
to fear some lame woman, who 'is destined to play a great part in
my life.'"
I remember the expression.
"Reflecting and being aware that
Nikolay Vsyevolodovitch has very numerous enemies, I promptly sent for a
man living here, one of his secret enemies, and the most vindictive and
contemptible of them, and from my conversation with him I gathered what
was the despicable source of the anonymous letter."
"If you too, my poor
Praskovya Ivanovna, have been worried by similar letters on my account,
and as you say 'bombarded' with them, I am, of course, the first to
regret having been the innocent cause of it."
"That's all I wanted to tell
you by way of explanation."
"I'm very sorry to see that you are so
tired and so upset."
"Besides, I have quite made up my mind to see that
suspicious personage of whom Mavriky Nikolaevitch said just now, a
little inappropriately, that it was impossible to receive him."
"Liza in
particular need have nothing to do with it."
"Come to me, Liza, my dear,
let me kiss you again."""
Liza crossed the room and stood in silence before Varvara Petrovna.
"The
latter kissed her, took her hands, and, holding her at arm's-length,
looked at her with feeling, then made the sign of the cross over her and
kissed her again."
"""Well, good-bye, Liza"" (there was almost the sound of tears in Varvara
Petrovna's voice), ""believe that I shall never cease to love you
whatever fate has in store for you."
God be with you.
"I have always
blessed His Holy Will....""

She would have added something more, but restrained herself and broke
off."
"Liza was walking back to her place, still in the same silence, as
it were plunged in thought, but she suddenly stopped before her mother."
"""I am not going yet, mother."
"I'll stay a little longer at auntie's,"" she
brought out in a low voice, but there was a note of iron determination
in those quiet words."
"""My goodness!"
"What now?"""
"wailed Praskovya Ivanovna, clasping her hands
helplessly."
"But Liza did not answer, and seemed indeed not to hear her;
she sat down in the same corner and fell to gazing into space again as
before."
There was a look of pride and triumph in Varvara Petrovna's face.
"""Mavriky Nikolaevitch, I have a great favour to ask of you."
"Be so kind
as to go and take a look at that person downstairs, and if there is any
possibility of admitting him, bring him up here."""
Mavriky Nikolaevitch bowed and went out.
"A moment later he brought in
Mr. Lebyadkin."
"IV

I have said something of this gentleman's outward appearance."
"He was a
tall, curly-haired, thick-set fellow about forty with a purplish, rather
bloated and flabby face, with cheeks that quivered at every movement of
his head, with little bloodshot eyes that were sometimes rather crafty,
with moustaches and side-whiskers, and with an incipient double chin,
fleshy and rather unpleasant-looking."
"But what was most striking about
him was the fact that he appeared now wearing a dress-coat and clean
linen."
"""There are people on whom clean linen is almost unseemly,"" as Liputin
had once said when Stepan Trofimovitch reproached him in jest for being
untidy."
"The captain had perfectly new black gloves too, of which he
held the right one in his hand, while the left, tightly stretched and
unbuttoned, covered part of the huge fleshy fist in which he held a
brand-new, glossy round hat, probably worn for the first time that day."
"It appeared therefore that ""the garb of love,"" of which he had shouted
to Shatov the day before, really did exist."
"All this, that is, the
dress-coat and clean linen, had been procured by Liputin's advice with
some mysterious object in view (as I found out later)."
"There was no
doubt that his coming now (in a hired carriage) was at the instigation
and with the assistance of someone else; it would never have dawned on
him, nor could he by himself have succeeded in dressing, getting ready
and making up his mind in three-quarters of an hour, even if the scene
in the porch of the cathedral had reached his ears at once."
"He was not
drunk, but was in the dull, heavy, dazed condition of a man suddenly
awakened after many days of drinking."
"It seemed as though he would be
drunk again if one were to put one's hands on his shoulders and rock
him to and fro once or twice."
"He was hurrying into the drawing-room but
stumbled over a rug near the doorway."
"Marya Timofyevna was helpless with
laughter."
"He looked savagely at her and suddenly took a few rapid steps
towards Varvara Petrovna."
"""I have come, madam..."" he blared out like a trumpet-blast."
"""Be so good, sir, as to take a seat there, on that chair,"" said Varvara
Petrovna, drawing herself up."
"""I shall hear you as well from there, and
it will be more convenient for me to look at you from here."""
"The captain stopped short, looking blankly before him."
"He turned,
however, and sat down on the seat indicated close to the door."
"An
extreme lack of self-confidence and at the same time insolence, and a
sort of incessant irritability, were apparent in the expression of his
face."
"He was horribly scared, that was evident, but his self-conceit
was wounded, and it might be surmised that his mortified vanity might on
occasion lead him to any effrontery, in spite of his cowardice."
"He was
evidently uneasy at every movement of his clumsy person."
"We all know
that when such gentlemen are brought by some marvellous chance into
society, they find their worst ordeal in their own hands, and the
impossibility of disposing them becomingly, of which they are conscious
at every moment."
"The captain sat rigid in his chair, with his hat and
gloves in his hands and his eyes fixed with a senseless stare on the
stern face of Varvara Petrovna."
"He would have liked, perhaps, to have
looked about more freely, but he could not bring himself to do so yet."
"Marya Timofyevna, apparently thinking his appearance very funny, laughed
again, but he did not stir."
"Varvara Petrovna ruthlessly kept him in this
position for a long time, a whole minute, staring at him without mercy."
"""In the first place allow me to learn your name from yourself,"" Varvara
Petrovna pronounced in measured and impressive tones."
"""Captain Lebyadkin,"" thundered the captain."
"""I have come, madam..."" He
made a movement again."
"""Allow me!"""
Varvara Petrovna checked him again.
"""Is this unfortunate
person who interests me so much really your sister?"""
"""My sister, madam, who has escaped from control, for she is in a certain
condition....""

He suddenly faltered and turned crimson."
"""Don't misunderstand me,
madam,"" he said, terribly confused."
"""Her own brother's not going to
throw mud at her... in a certain condition doesn't mean in such a
condition... in the sense of an injured reputation... in the last
stage..."" he suddenly broke off."
"""Sir!"""
"said Varvara Petrovna, raising her head."
"""In this condition!"""
"he concluded suddenly, tapping the middle of his
forehead with his finger."
A pause followed.
"""And has she suffered in this way for long?"""
"asked Varvara Petrovna,
with a slight drawl."
"""Madam, I have come to thank you for the generosity you showed in the
porch, in a Russian, brotherly way."""
"""Brotherly?"""
"""I mean, not brotherly, but simply in the sense that I am my sister's
brother; and believe me, madam,"" he went on more hurriedly, turning
crimson again, ""I am not so uneducated as I may appear at first sight in
your drawing-room."
"My sister and I are nothing, madam, compared with the
luxury we observe here."
"Having enemies who slander us, besides."
"But on
the question of reputation Lebyadkin is proud, madam... and... and ...
and I've come to repay with thanks...."
"Here is money, madam!"""
"At this point he pulled out a pocket-book, drew out of it a bundle of
notes, and began turning them over with trembling fingers in a perfect
fury of impatience."
"It was evident that he was in haste to explain
something, and indeed it was quite necessary to do so."
"But probably
feeling himself that his fluster with the money made him look even more
foolish, he lost the last traces of self-possession."
"The money refused
to be counted."
"His fingers fumbled helplessly, and to complete his shame
a green note escaped from the pocket-book, and fluttered in zigzags on
to the carpet."
"""Twenty roubles, madam."""
"He leapt up suddenly with the roll of notes in
his hand, his face perspiring with discomfort."
"Noticing the note which
had dropped on the floor, he was bending down to pick it up, but for
some reason overcome by shame, he dismissed it with a wave."
"""For your servants, madam; for the footman who picks it up."
"Let them
remember my sister!"""
"""I cannot allow that,"" Varvara Petrovna brought out hurriedly, even with
some alarm."
"""In that case...""

He bent down, picked it up, flushing crimson, and suddenly going up to
Varvara Petrovna held out the notes he had counted."
"""What's this?"""
"she cried, really alarmed at last, and positively
shrinking back in her chair."
"Mavriky Nikolaevitch, Stepan Trofimovitch, and I all stepped forward."
"""Don't be alarmed, don't be alarmed; I'm not mad, by God, I'm not mad,""
the captain kept asseverating excitedly."
"""Yes, sir, you're out of your senses."""
"""Madam, she's not at all as you suppose."
I am an insignificant link.
"Oh, madam, wealthy are your mansions, but poor is the dwelling of Marya
Anonyma, my sister, whose maiden name was Lebyadkin, but whom we'll call
Anonyma for the time, only for _the time,_ madam, for God Himself will
not suffer it forever."
"Madam, you gave her ten roubles and she took it,
because it was from _you,_ madam!"
"Do you hear, madam?"
"From no one else
in the world would this Marya Anonyma take it, or her grandfather, the
officer killed in the Caucasus before the very eyes of Yermolov, would
turn in his grave."
"But from you, madam, from you she will take anything."
"But with one hand she takes it, and with the other she holds out to
you twenty roubles by way of subscription to one of the benevolent
committees in Petersburg and Moscow, of which you are a member... for
you published yourself, madam, in the _Moscow News,_ that you are ready to
receive subscriptions in our town, and that any one may subscribe....""

The captain suddenly broke off; he breathed hard as though after some
difficult achievement."
"All he said about the benevolent society had
probably been prepared beforehand, perhaps under Liputin's supervision."
He perspired more than ever; drops literally trickled down his temples.
Varvara Petrovna looked searchingly at him.
"""The subscription list,"" she said severely, ""is always downstairs in
charge of my porter."
"There you can enter your subscriptions if you wish
to."
"And so I beg you to put your notes away and not to wave them in the
air."
That's right.
I beg you also to go back to your seat.
That's right.
"I am very sorry, sir, that I made a mistake about your sister, and gave
her something as though she were poor when she is so rich."
"There's only
one thing I don't understand, why she can only take from me, and no one
else."
"You so insisted upon that that I should like a full explanation."""
"""Madam, that is a secret that may be buried only in the grave!"""
"answered
the captain."
"""Why?"""
"Varvara Petrovna asked, not quite so firmly."
"""Madam, madam...""

He relapsed into gloomy silence, looking on the floor, laying his right
hand on his heart."
"Varvara Petrovna waited, not taking her eyes off him."
"""Madam!"""
he roared suddenly.
"""Will you allow me to ask you one question?"
"Only one, but frankly, directly, like a Russian, from the heart?"""
"""Kindly do so."""
"""Have you ever suffered madam, in your life?"""
"""You simply mean to say that you have been or are being ill-treated by
someone."""
"""Madam, madam!"""
"He jumped up again, probably unconscious of doing
so, and struck himself on the breast."
"""Here in this bosom so much has
accumulated, so much that God Himself will be amazed when it is revealed
at the Day of Judgment."""
"""H'm!"
"A strong expression!"""
"""Madam, I speak perhaps irritably....""

""Don't be uneasy."
"I know myself when to stop you."""
"""May I ask you another question, madam?"""
"""Ask another question."""
"""Can one die simply from the generosity of one's feelings?"""
"""I don't know, as I've never asked myself such a question."""
"""You don't know!"
"You've never asked yourself such a question,"" he said
with pathetic irony."
"""Well, if that's it, if that's it...

_""Be still, despairing heart!"
"""_

And he struck himself furiously on the chest."
"He was by now walking
about the room again."
"It is typical of such people to be utterly incapable of keeping their
desires to themselves; they have, on the contrary, an irresistible
impulse to display them in all their unseemliness as soon as they arise."
"When such a gentleman gets into a circle in which he is not at home
he usually begins timidly,--but you have only to give him an inch and he
will at once rush into impertinence."
The captain was already excited.
"He walked about waving his arms and not listening to questions, talked
about himself very, very quickly, so that sometimes his tongue would not
obey him, and without finishing one phrase he passed to another."
"It is
true he was probably not quite sober."
"Moreover, Lizaveta Nikolaevna
was sitting there too, and though he did not once glance at her, her
presence seemed to over-excite him terribly; that, however, is only my
supposition."
"There must have been some reason which led Varvara Petrovna
to resolve to listen to such a man in spite of her repugnance."
"Praskovya
Ivanovna was simply shaking with terror, though, I believe she really
did not quite understand what it was about."
"Stepan Trofimovitch was
trembling too, but that was, on the contrary, because he was disposed to
understand everything, and exaggerate it."
"Mavriky Nikolaevitch stood in
the attitude of one ready to defend all present; Liza was pale, and she
gazed fixedly with wide-open eyes at the wild captain."
"Shatov sat in
the same position as before, but, what was strangest of all, Marya
Timofyevna had not only ceased laughing, but had become terribly sad."
"She leaned her right elbow on the table, and with a prolonged, mournful
gaze watched her brother declaiming."
"Darya Pavlovna alone seemed to me
calm."
"""All that is nonsensical allegory,"" said Varvara Petrovna, getting angry
at last."
"""You haven't answered my question, why?"
"I insist on an answer."""
"""I haven't answered, why?"
"You insist on an answer, why?"""
"repeated
the captain, winking."
"""That little word 'why' has run through all the
universe from the first day of creation, and all nature cries every
minute to it's Creator, 'why?'"
"And for seven thousand years it has had
no answer, and must Captain Lebyadkin alone answer?"
"And is that justice,
madam?"""
"""That's all nonsense and not to the point!"""
"cried Varvara Petrovna,
getting angry and losing patience."
"""That's allegory; besides, you
express yourself too sensationally, sir, which I consider impertinence."""
"""Madam,"" the captain went on, not hearing, ""I should have liked perhaps
to be called Ernest, yet I am forced to bear the vulgar name Ignat--why
is that do you suppose?"
"I should have liked to be called Prince de
Monbart, yet I am only Lebyadkin, derived from a swan."
* Why is that?
"I am a poet, madam, a poet in soul, and might be getting a thousand
roubles at a time from a publisher, yet I am forced to live in a pig
pail."
Why?
"Why, madam?"
"To my mind Russia is a freak of nature and
nothing else."""
"* From Lebyed, a Swan."
"""Can you really say nothing more definite?"""
"""I can read you the poem, 'The Cockroach,' madam."""
"""Wha-a-t?"""
"""Madam, I'm not mad yet!"
"I shall be mad, no doubt I shall be, but I'm
not so yet."
"Madam, a friend of mine--a most honourable man--has written
a Krylov's fable, called 'The Cockroach.'"
"May I read it?"""
"""You want to read some fable of Krylov's?"""
"""No, it's not a fable of Krylov's I want to read."
"It's my fable, my own
composition."
"Believe me, madam, without offence I'm not so uneducated
and depraved as not to understand that Russia can boast of a great
fable-writer, Krylov, to whom the Minister of Education has raised a
monument in the Summer Gardens for the diversion of the young."
"Here,
madam, you ask me why?"
"The answer is at the end of this fable, in
letters of fire."""
"""Read your fable."""
"""Lived a cockroach in the world
     Such was his condition,
     In a glass he chanced to fall
     Full of fly-perdition."""
"""Heavens!"
"What does it mean?"""
cried Varvara Petrovna.
"""That's when flies get into a glass in the summer-time,"" the captain
explained hurriedly with the irritable impatience of an author interrupted
in reading."
"""Then it is perdition to the flies, any fool can understand."
"Don't interrupt, don't interrupt."
"You'll see, you'll see...."" He kept waving
his arms."
"""But he squeezed against the flies,
     They woke up and cursed him,
     Raised to Jove their angry cries;
     'The glass is full to bursting!'"
"In the middle of the din
     Came along Nikifor,
     Fine old man, and looking in..."
I haven't quite finished it.
"But no matter, I'll tell it in words,""
the captain rattled on."
"""Nikifor takes the glass, and in spite of their
outcry empties away the whole stew, flies, and beetles and all, into the
pig pail, which ought to have been done long ago."
"But observe, madam,
observe, the cockroach doesn't complain."
"That's the answer to your
question, why?"""
he cried triumphantly.
"""'The cockroach does not
complain.'"
"As for Nikifor he typifies nature,"" he added, speaking
rapidly and walking complacently about the room."
Varvara Petrovna was terribly angry.
"""And allow me to ask you about that money said to have been received
from Nikolay Vsyevolodovitch, and not to have been given to you, about
which you dared to accuse a person belonging to my household."""
"""It's a slander!"""
"roared Lebyadkin, flinging up his right hand
tragically."
"""No, it's not a slander."""
"""Madam, there are circumstances that force one to endure family disgrace
rather than proclaim the truth aloud."
"Lebyadkin will not blab, madam!"""
"He seemed dazed; he was carried away; he felt his importance; he
certainly had some fancy in his mind."
"By now he wanted to insult some
one, to do something nasty to show his power."
"""Ring, please, Stepan Trofimovitch,"" Varvara Petrovna asked him."
"""Lebyadkin's cunning, madam,"" he said, winking with his evil smile;
""he's cunning, but he too has a weak spot, he too at times is in the
portals of passions, and these portals are the old military hussars'
bottle, celebrated by Denis Davydov."
"So when he is in those portals,
madam, he may happen to send a letter in verse, a most magnificent
letter--but which afterwards he would have wished to take back, with the
tears of all his life; for the feeling of the beautiful is destroyed."
"But the bird has flown, you won't catch it by the tail."
"In those portals
now, madam, Lebyadkin may have spoken about an honourable young lady,
in the honourable indignation of a soul revolted by wrongs, and his
slanderers have taken advantage of it."
"But Lebyadkin is cunning, madam!"
"And in vain a malignant wolf sits over him every minute, filling his
glass and waiting for the end."
Lebyadkin won't blab.
"And at the bottom
of the bottle he always finds instead Lebyadkin's cunning."
"But enough,
oh, enough, madam!"
"Your splendid halls might belong to the noblest in
the land, but the cockroach will not complain."
"Observe that, observe
that he does not complain, and recognise his noble spirit!"""
"At that instant a bell rang downstairs from the porter's room, and
almost at the same moment Alexey Yegorytch appeared in response to
Stepan Trofimovitch's ring, which he had somewhat delayed answering."
"The
correct old servant was unusually excited."
"""Nikolay Vsyevolodovitch has graciously arrived this moment and is
coming here,"" he pronounced, in reply to Varvara Petrovna's questioning
glance."
"I particularly remember her at that moment; at first she turned
pale, but suddenly her eyes flashed."
"She drew herself up in her chair
with an air of extraordinary determination."
"Every one was astounded
indeed."
"The utterly unexpected arrival of Nikolay Vsyevolodovitch,
who was not expected for another month, was not only strange from its
unexpectedness but from its fateful coincidence with the present moment."
"Even the captain remained standing like a post in the middle of the room
with his mouth wide open, staring at the door with a fearfully stupid
expression."
"And, behold, from the next room--a very large and long apartment--came
the sound of swiftly approaching footsteps, little, exceedingly rapid
steps; someone seemed to be running, and that someone suddenly flew
into the drawing-room, not Nikolay Vsyevolodovitch, but a young man who
was a complete stranger to all."
"V

I will permit myself to halt here to sketch in a few hurried strokes
this person who had so suddenly arrived on the scene."
"He was a young man of twenty-seven or thereabouts, a little above the
medium height, with rather long, lank, flaxen hair, and with faintly
defined, irregular moustache and beard."
"He was dressed neatly, and in
the fashion, though not like a dandy."
"At the first glance he looked
round-shouldered and awkward, but yet he was not round-shouldered, and
his manner was easy."
"He seemed a queer fish, and yet later on we all
thought his manners good, and his conversation always to the point."
"No one would have said that he was ugly, and yet no one would have liked
his face."
"His head was elongated at the back, and looked flattened at
the sides, so that his face seemed pointed, his forehead was high and
narrow, but his features were small; his eyes were keen, his nose was
small and sharp, his lips were long and thin."
"The expression of his face
suggested ill-health, but this was misleading."
"He had a wrinkle on each
cheek which gave him the look of a man who had just recovered from a
serious illness."
"Yet he was perfectly well and strong, and had never
been ill."
"He walked and moved very hurriedly, yet never seemed in a hurry to
be off."
"It seemed as though nothing could disconcert him; in every
circumstance and in every sort of society he remained the same."
"He had a
great deal of conceit, but was utterly unaware of it himself."
"He talked quickly, hurriedly, but at the same time with assurance, and
was never at a loss for a word."
"In spite of his hurried manner his ideas
were in perfect order, distinct and definite--and this was particularly
striking."
His articulation was wonderfully clear.
"His words pattered out
like smooth, big grains, always well chosen, and at your service."
"At first this attracted one, but afterwards it became repulsive, just
because of this over-distinct articulation, this string of ever-ready
words."
"One somehow began to imagine that he must have a tongue of
special shape, somehow exceptionally long and thin, extremely red with a
very sharp everlastingly active little tip."
"Well, this was the young man who darted now into the drawing-room, and
really, I believe to this day, that he began to talk in the next room,
and came in speaking."
"He was standing before Varvara Petrovna in a
trice."
"""... Only fancy, Varvara Petrovna,"" he pattered on, ""I came in expecting
to find he'd been here for the last quarter of an hour; he arrived an
hour and a half ago; we met at Kirillov's: he set off half an hour ago
meaning to come straight here, and told me to come here too, a quarter
of an hour later....""

""But who?"
"Who told you to come here?"""
Varvara Petrovna inquired.
"""Why, Nikolay Vsyevolodovitch!"
"Surely this isn't the first you've heard
of it!"
"But his luggage must have been here a long while, anyway."
"How
is it you weren't told?"
Then I'm the first to bring the news.
"One might
send out to look for him; he's sure to be here himself directly
though."
"And I fancy, at the moment that just fits in with some of
his expectations, and is far as I can judge, at least, some of his
calculations."""
"At this point he turned his eyes about the room and fixed them with
special attention on the captain."
"""Ach, Lizaveta Nikolaevna, how glad I am to meet you at the very first
step, delighted to shake hands with you."""
"He flew up to Liza, who
was smiling gaily, to take her proffered hand, ""and I observe that my
honoured friend Praskovya Ivanovna has not forgotten her 'professor,'
and actually isn't cross with him, as she always used to be in
Switzerland."
"But how are your legs, here, Praskovya Ivanovna, and were
the Swiss doctors right when at the consultation they prescribed your
native air?"
What?
Fomentations?
That ought to do good.
"But how sorry I
was, Varvara Petrovna"" (he turned rapidly to her) ""that I didn't arrive
in time to meet you abroad, and offer my respects to you in person; I
had so much to tell you too."
"I did send word to my old man here, but I
fancy that he did as he always does...""

""Petrusha!"""
"cried Stepan Trofimovitch, instantly roused from his
stupefaction."
He clasped his hands and flew to his son.
"""_Pierre, mon
enfant!_ Why, I didn't know you!"""
"He pressed him in his arms and the
tears rolled down his cheeks."
"""Come, be quiet, be quiet, no flourishes, that's enough, that's enough,
please,"" Petrusha muttered hurriedly, trying to extricate himself from
his embrace."
"""I've always sinned against you, always!"""
"""Well, that's enough."
We can talk of that later.
I knew you'd carry on.
"Come, be a little more sober, please."""
"""But it's ten years since I've seen you."""
"""The less reason for demonstrations."""
"_""Mon enfant!..."
"""_

""Come, I believe in your affection, I believe in it, take your arms
away."
"You see, you're disturbing other people.... Ah, here's Nikolay
Vsyevolodovitch; keep quiet, please."""
"Nikolay Vsyevolodovitch was already in the room; he came in very quietly
and stood still for an instant in the doorway, quietly scrutinising the
company."
"I was struck by the first sight of him just as I had been four years
before, when I saw him for the first time."
"I had not forgotten him in
the least."
"But I think there are some countenances which always seem to
exhibit something new which one has not noticed before, every time
one meets them, though one may have seen them a hundred times already."
Apparently he was exactly the same as he had been four years before.
"He
was as elegant, as dignified, he moved with the same air of consequence
as before, indeed he looked almost as young."
"His faint smile had just
the same official graciousness and complacency."
"His eyes had the same
stern, thoughtful and, as it were, preoccupied look."
"In fact, it seemed
as though we had only parted the day before."
But one thing struck me.
"In
old days, though he had been considered handsome, his face was ""like a
mask,"" as some of our sharp-tongued ladies had expressed it."
"Now--now,
I don't know why he impressed me at once as absolutely, incontestably
beautiful, so that no one could have said that his face was like a mask."
"Wasn't it perhaps that he was a little paler and seemed rather thinner
than before?"
"Or was there, perhaps, the light of some new idea in his
eyes?"
"""Nikolay Vsyevolodovitch!"""
"cried Varvara Petrovna, drawing herself up
but not rising from her chair."
"""Stop a minute!"""
"She checked his advance
with a peremptory gesture."
"But to explain the awful question which immediately followed that
gesture and exclamation--a question which I should have imagined to be
impossible even in Varvara Petrovna, I must ask the reader to remember
what that lady's temperament had always been, and the extraordinary
impulsiveness she showed at some critical moments."
"I beg him to consider
also, that in spite of the exceptional strength of her spirit and
the very considerable amount of common sense and practical, so to say
business, tact she possessed, there were moments in her life in which
she abandoned herself altogether, entirely and, if it's permissible
to say so, absolutely without restraint."
"I beg him to take into
consideration also that the present moment might really be for her one
of those in which all the essence of life, of all the past and all the
present, perhaps, too, all the future, is concentrated, as it were,
focused."
"I must briefly recall, too, the anonymous letter of which she
had spoken to Praskovya Ivanovna with so much irritation, though I think
she said nothing of the latter part of it."
"Yet it perhaps contained the
explanation of the possibility of the terrible question with which she
suddenly addressed her son."
"""Nikolay Vsyevolodovitch,"" she repeated, rapping out her words in a
resolute voice in which there was a ring of menacing challenge, ""I beg
you to tell me at once, without moving from that place; is it true that
this unhappy cripple--here she is, here, look at her--is it true that
she is... your lawful wife?"""
"I remember that moment only too well; he did not wink an eyelash but
looked intently at his mother."
"Not the faintest change in his face
followed."
"At last he smiled, a sort of indulgent smile, and without
answering a word went quietly up to his mother, took her hand, raised it
respectfully to his lips and kissed it."
"And so great was his invariable
and irresistible ascendancy over his mother that even now she could not
bring herself to pull away her hand."
"She only gazed at him, her whole
figure one concentrated question, seeming to betray that she could not
bear the suspense another moment."
But he was still silent.
"When he had kissed her hand, he scanned the
whole room once more, and moving, as before, without haste went towards
Marya Timofyevna."
"It is very difficult to describe people's countenances
at certain moments."
"I remember, for instance, that Marya Timofyevna,
breathless with fear, rose to her feet to meet him and clasped her hands
before her, as though beseeching him."
"And at the same time I remember
the frantic ecstasy which almost distorted her face--an ecstasy almost
too great for any human being to bear."
"Perhaps both were there, both the
terror and the ecstasy."
"But I remember moving quickly towards her (I was
standing not far off), for I fancied she was going to faint."
"""You should not be here,"" Nikolay Vsyevolodovitch said to her in
a caressing and melodious voice; and there was the light of an
extraordinary tenderness in his eyes."
"He stood before her in the most
respectful attitude, and every gesture showed sincere respect for her."
The poor girl faltered impulsively in a half-whisper.
"""But may I... kneel down... to you now?"""
"""No, you can't do that."""
"He smiled at her magnificently, so that she too laughed joyfully at
once."
"In the same melodious voice, coaxing her tenderly as though she
were a child, he went on gravely."
"""Only think that you are a girl, and that though I'm your devoted friend
I'm an outsider, not your husband, nor your father, nor your betrothed."
"Give me your arm and let us go; I will take you to the carriage, and if
you will let me I will see you all the way home."""
"She listened, and bent her head as though meditating."
"""Let's go,"" she said with a sigh, giving him her hand."
But at that point a slight mischance befell her.
"She must have turned
carelessly, resting on her lame leg, which was shorter than the other."
"She fell sideways into the chair, and if the chair had not been there
would have fallen on to the floor."
"He instantly seized and supported
her, and holding her arm firmly in his, led her carefully and
sympathetically to the door."
"She was evidently mortified at having
fallen; she was overwhelmed, blushed, and was terribly abashed."
"Looking
dumbly on the ground, limping painfully, she hobbled after him, almost
hanging on his arm."
So they went out.
"Liza, I saw, suddenly jumped up
from her chair for some reason as they were going out, and she followed
them with intent eyes till they reached the door."
"Then she sat down
again in silence, but there was a nervous twitching in her face, as
though she had touched a viper."
"While this scene was taking place between Nikolay Vsyevolodovitch and
Marya Timofyevna every one was speechless with amazement; one could have
heard a fly; but as soon as they had gone out, every one began suddenly
talking."
"VI

It was very little of it talk, however; it was mostly exclamation."
"I've
forgotten a little the order in which things happened, for a scene of
confusion followed."
"Stepan Trofimovitch uttered some exclamation in
French, clasping his hands, but Varvara Petrovna had no thought for him."
"Even Mavriky Nikolaevitch muttered some rapid, jerky comment."
"But Pyotr
Stepanovitch was the most excited of all."
"He was trying desperately with
bold gesticulations to persuade Varvara Petrovna of something, but it
was a long time before I could make out what it was."
"He appealed
to Praskovya Ivanovna, and Lizaveta Nikolaevna too, even, in his
excitement, addressed a passing shout to his father--in fact he seemed
all over the room at once."
"Varvara Petrovna, flushing all over, sprang
up from her seat and cried to Praskovya Ivanovna:

""Did you hear what he said to her here just now, did you hear it?"""
But the latter was incapable of replying.
"She could only mutter
something and wave her hand."
"The poor woman had troubles of her own to
think about."
"She kept turning her head towards Liza and was watching her
with unaccountable terror, but she didn't even dare to think of getting
up and going away until her daughter should get up."
"In the meantime the
captain wanted to slip away."
That I noticed.
"There was no doubt that he
had been in a great panic from the instant that Nikolay Vsyevolodovitch
had made his appearance; but Pyotr Stepanovitch took him by the arm and
would not let him go."
"""It is necessary, quite necessary,"" he pattered on to Varvara Petrovna,
still trying to persuade her."
"He stood facing her, as she was sitting
down again in her easy chair, and, I remember, was listening to him
eagerly; he had succeeded in securing her attention."
"""It is necessary."
"You can see for yourself, Varvara Petrovna, that there
is a misunderstanding here, and much that is strange on the surface,
and yet the thing's as clear as daylight, and as simple as my finger."
"I
quite understand that no one has authorised me to tell the story, and
I dare say I look ridiculous putting myself forward."
"But in the first
place, Nikolay Vsyevolodovitch attaches no sort of significance to
the matter himself, and, besides, there are incidents of which it is
difficult for a man to make up his mind to give an explanation himself."
"And so it's absolutely necessary that it should be undertaken by a third
person, for whom it's easier to put some delicate points into words."
"Believe me, Varvara Petrovna, that Nikolay Vsyevolodovitch is not at
all to blame for not immediately answering your question just now with
a full explanation, it's all a trivial affair."
"I've known him since his
Petersburg days."
"Besides, the whole story only does honour to Nikolay
Vsyevolodovitch, if one must make use of that vague word 'honour.'"""
"""You mean to say that you were a witness of some incident which gave
rise... to this misunderstanding?"""
asked Varvara Petrovna.
"""I witnessed it, and took part in it,"" Pyotr Stepanovitch hastened to
declare."
"""If you'll give me your word that this will not wound Nikolay
Vsyevolodovitch's delicacy in regard to his feeling for me, from whom
he ne-e-ver conceals anything... and if you are convinced also that your
doing this will be agreeable to him...""

""Certainly it will be agreeable, and for that reason I consider it a
particularly agreeable duty."
"I am convinced that he would beg me to do
it himself."""
"The intrusive desire of this gentleman, who seemed to have dropped on
us from heaven to tell stories about other people's affairs, was rather
strange and inconsistent with ordinary usage."
But he had caught Varvara Petrovna by touching on too painful a spot.
"I did not know the man's character at that time, and still less his
designs."
"""I am listening,"" Varvara Petrovna announced with a reserved and
cautious manner."
She was rather painfully aware of her condescension.
"""It's a short story; in fact if you like it's not a story at all,"" he
rattled on, ""though a novelist might work it up into a novel in an idle
hour."
"It's rather an interesting little incident, Praskovya Ivanovna,
and I am sure that Lizaveta Nikolaevna will be interested to hear
it, because there are a great many things in it that are odd if not
wonderful."
"Five years ago, in Petersburg, Nikolay Vsyevolodovitch
made the acquaintance of this gentleman, this very Mr. Lebyadkin who's
standing here with his mouth open, anxious, I think, to slip away at
once."
"Excuse me, Varvara Petrovna."
"I don't advise you to make your
escape though, you discharged clerk in the former commissariat
department; you see, I remember you very well."
"Nikolay Vsyevolodovitch
and I know very well what you've been up to here, and, don't forget,
you'll have to answer for it."
"I ask your pardon once more, Varvara
Petrovna."
"In those days Nikolay Vsyevolodovitch used to call this
gentleman his Falstaff; that must be,"" he explained suddenly, ""some old
burlesque character, at whom every one laughs, and who is willing to
let every one laugh at him, if only they'll pay him for it."
"Nikolay
Vsyevolodovitch was leading at that time in Petersburg a life, so to
say, of mockery."
"I can't find another word to describe it, because he
is not a man who falls into disillusionment, and he disdained to be
occupied with work at that time."
"I'm only speaking of that period,
Varvara Petrovna."
"Lebyadkin had a sister, the woman who was sitting here
just now."
"The brother and sister hadn't a corner* of their own, but
were always quartering themselves on different people."
"He used to hang
about the arcades in the Gostiny Dvor, always wearing his old uniform,
and would stop the more respectable-looking passers-by, and everything
he got from them he'd spend in drink."
"His sister lived like the birds
of heaven."
"She'd help people in their 'corners,' and do jobs for them
on occasion."
It was a regular Bedlam.
"I'll pass over the description
of this life in 'corners,' a life to which Nikolay Vsyevolodovitch had
taken,""

     * In the poorer quarters of Russian towns a single room is often
     let out to several families, each of which occupies a ""corner."""
"""at that time, from eccentricity."
"I'm only talking of that period,
Varvara Petrovna; as for 'eccentricity,' that's his own expression."
"He
does not conceal much from me."
Mlle.
"Lebyadkin, who was thrown in the
way of meeting Nikolay Vsyevolodovitch very often, at one time, was
fascinated by his appearance."
"He was, so to say, a diamond set in the
dirty background of her life."
"I am a poor hand at describing feelings,
so I'll pass them over; but some of that dirty lot took to jeering at
her once, and it made her sad."
"They always had laughed at her, but she
did not seem to notice it before."
"She wasn't quite right in her head
even then, but very different from what she is now."
"There's reason to
believe that in her childhood she received something like an education
through the kindness of a benevolent lady."
"Nikolay Vsyevolodovitch
had never taken the slightest notice of her."
"He used to spend his time
chiefly in playing preference with a greasy old pack of cards for
stakes of a quarter-farthing with clerks."
"But once, when she was being
ill-treated, he went up (without inquiring into the cause) and seized
one of the clerks by the collar and flung him out of a second-floor
window."
"It was not a case of chivalrous indignation at the sight of
injured innocence; the whole operation took place in the midst of roars
of laughter, and the one who laughed loudest was Nikolay Vsyevolodovitch
himself."
"As it all ended without harm, they were reconciled and began
drinking punch."
But the injured innocent herself did not forget it.
"Of
course it ended in her becoming completely crazy."
"I repeat I'm a poor
hand at describing feelings."
"But a delusion was the chief feature in
this case."
"And Nikolay Vsyevolodovitch aggravated that delusion as
though he did it on purpose."
"Instead of laughing at her he began all
at once treating Mlle."
Lebyadkin with sudden respect.
"Kirillov, who was
there (a very original man, Varvara Petrovna, and very abrupt, you'll
see him perhaps one day, for he's here now), well, this Kirillov who,
as a rule, is perfectly silent, suddenly got hot, and said to Nikolay
Vsyevolodovitch, I remember, that he treated the girl as though she were
a marquise, and that that was doing for her altogether."
"I must add that
Nikolay Vsyevolodovitch had rather a respect for this Kirillov."
"What do
you suppose was the answer he gave him: 'You imagine, Mr. Kirillov, that
I am laughing at her."
"Get rid of that idea, I really do respect her,
for she's better than any of us.'"
"And, do you know, he said it in such a
serious tone."
"Meanwhile, he hadn't really said a word to her for two or
three months, except 'good morning' and 'good-bye.'"
"I remember, for I
was there, that she came at last to the point of looking on him almost
as her betrothed who dared not 'elope with her,' simply because he had
many enemies and family difficulties, or something of the sort."
There was a great deal of laughter about it.
"It ended in Nikolay
Vsyevolodovitch's making provision for her when he had to come here, and
I believe he arranged to pay a considerable sum, three hundred roubles a
year, if not more, as a pension for her."
"In short it was all a caprice,
a fancy of a man prematurely weary on his side, perhaps--it may even
have been, as Kirillov says, a new experiment of a blasé man, with
the object of finding out what you can bring a crazy cripple to."""
"(You
picked out on purpose, he said, the lowest creature, a cripple, forever
covered with disgrace and blows, knowing, too, that this creature was
dying of comic love for you, and set to work to mystify her completely
on purpose, simply to see what would come of it.)"
"""Though, how is a man
so particularly to blame for the fancies of a crazy woman, to whom
he had hardly uttered two sentences the whole time."
"There are things,
Varvara Petrovna, of which it is not only impossible to speak sensibly,
but it's even nonsensical to begin speaking of them at all."
"Well,
eccentricity then, let it stand at that."
"Anyway, there's nothing worse
to be said than that; and yet now they've made this scandal out of it."
...
"I am to some extent aware, Varvara Petrovna, of what is happening
here."""
The speaker suddenly broke off and was turning to Lebyadkin.
"But Varvara
Petrovna checked him."
She was in a state of extreme exaltation.
"""Have you finished?"""
she asked.
"""Not yet; to complete my story I should have to ask this gentleman one
or two questions if you'll allow me... you'll see the point in a minute,
Varvara Petrovna."""
"""Enough, afterwards, leave it for the moment I beg you."
"Oh, I was quite
right to let you speak!"""
"""And note this, Varvara Petrovna,"" Pyotr Stepanovitch said hastily."
"""Could Nikolay Vsyevolodovitch have explained all this just now in
answer to your question, which was perhaps too peremptory?"""
"""Oh, yes, it was."""
"""And wasn't I right in saying that in some cases it's much easier for a
third person to explain things than for the person interested?"""
"""Yes, yes... but in one thing you were mistaken, and, I see with regret,
are still mistaken."""
"""Really, what's that?"""
"""You see...."
"But won't you sit down, Pyotr Stepanovitch?"""
"""Oh, as you please."
I am tired indeed.
"Thank you."""
"He instantly moved up
an easy chair and turned it so that he had Varvara Petrovna on one
side and Praskovya Ivanovna at the table on the other, while he faced
Lebyadkin, from whom he did not take his eyes for one minute."
"""You are mistaken in calling this eccentricity....""

""Oh, if it's only that....""

""No, no, no, wait a little,"" said Varvara Petrovna, who was obviously
about to say a good deal and to speak with enthusiasm."
"As soon as Pyotr
Stepanovitch noticed it, he was all attention."
"""No, it was something higher than eccentricity, and I assure you,
something sacred even!"
"A proud man who has suffered humiliation early
in life and reached the stage of 'mockery' as you so subtly called
it--Prince Harry, in fact, to use the capital nickname Stepan
Trofimovitch gave him then, which would have been perfectly correct if
it were not that he is more like Hamlet, to my thinking at least."""
"_""Et vous avez raison,""_ Stepan Trofimovitch pronounced, impressively and
with feeling."
"""Thank you, Stepan Trofimovitch."
"I thank you particularly too for your
unvarying faith in Nicolas, in the loftiness of his soul and of his
destiny."
"That faith you have even strengthened in me when I was losing
heart."""
"_""Chère, chère."
"""_ Stepan Trofimovitch was stepping forward, when he
checked himself, reflecting that it was dangerous to interrupt."
"""And if Nicolas had always had at his side"" (Varvara Petrovna almost
shouted) ""a gentle Horatio, great in his humility--another excellent
expression of yours, Stepan Trofimovitch--he might long ago have been
saved from the sad and 'sudden demon of irony,' which has tormented him
all his life."
"('The demon of irony' was a wonderful expression of yours
again, Stepan Trofimovitch.)"
"But Nicolas has never had an Horatio or an
Ophelia."
"He had no one but his mother, and what can a mother do alone,
and in such circumstances?"
"Do you know, Pyotr Stepanovitch, it's
perfectly comprehensible to me now that a being like Nicolas could be
found even in such filthy haunts as you have described."
"I can so clearly
picture now that 'mockery' of life."
"(A wonderfully subtle expression
of yours!)"
"That insatiable thirst of contrast, that gloomy background
against which he stands out like a diamond, to use your comparison
again, Pyotr Stepanovitch."
"And then he meets there a creature
ill-treated by every one, crippled, half insane, and at the same time
perhaps filled with noble feelings."""
"""H'm...."
"Yes, perhaps."""
"""And after that you don't understand that he's not laughing at her like
every one."
"Oh, you people!"
"You can't understand his defending her from
insult, treating her with respect 'like a marquise' (this Kirillov
must have an exceptionally deep understanding of men, though he didn't
understand Nicolas)."
"It was just this contrast, if you like, that led to
the trouble."
"If the unhappy creature had been in different surroundings,
perhaps she would never have been brought to entertain such a frantic
delusion."
"Only a woman can understand it, Pyotr Stepanovitch, only a
woman."
"How sorry I am that you... not that you're not a woman, but that
you can't be one just for the moment so as to understand."""
"""You mean in the sense that the worse things are the better it is."
"I
understand, I understand, Varvara Petrovna."
"It's rather as it is in
religion; the harder life is for a man or the more crushed and poor the
people are, the more obstinately they dream of compensation in heaven;
and if a hundred thousand priests are at work at it too, inflaming
their delusion, and speculating on it, then..."
"I understand you, Varvara
Petrovna, I assure you."""
"""That's not quite it; but tell me, ought Nicolas to have laughed at her
and have treated her as the other clerks, in order to extinguish the
delusion in this unhappy organism."""
"(Why Varvara Petrovna used the word
organism I couldn't understand.)"
"""Can you really refuse to recognise
the lofty compassion, the noble tremor of the whole organism with which
Nicolas answered Kirillov: 'I do not laugh at her.'"
"A noble, sacred
answer!"""
"""Sublime,"" muttered Stepan Trofimovitch."
"""And observe, too, that he is by no means so rich as you suppose."
"The
money is mine and not his, and he would take next to nothing from me
then."""
"""I understand, I understand all that, Varvara Petrovna,"" said Pyotr
Stepanovitch, with a movement of some impatience."
"""Oh, it's my character!"
I recognise myself in Nicolas.
"I recognise that
youthfulness, that liability to violent, tempestuous impulses."
"And if
we ever come to be friends, Pyotr Stepanovitch, and, for my part, I
sincerely hope we may, especially as I am so deeply indebted to you,
then, perhaps you'll understand....""

""Oh, I assure you, I hope for it too,"" Pyotr Stepanovitch muttered
jerkily."
"""You'll understand then the impulse which leads one in the blindness
of generous feeling to take up a man who is unworthy of one in every
respect, a man who utterly fails to understand one, who is ready to
torture one at every opportunity and, in contradiction to everything, to
exalt such a man into a sort of ideal, into a dream."
"To concentrate in
him all one's hopes, to bow down before him; to love him all one's life,
absolutely without knowing why--perhaps just because he was unworthy of
it.... Oh, how I've suffered all my life, Pyotr Stepanovitch!"""
"Stepan Trofimovitch, with a look of suffering on his face, began trying
to catch my eye, but I turned away in time."
"""... And only lately, only lately--oh, how unjust I've been to Nicolas!"
"... You would not believe how they have been worrying me on all sides,
all, all, enemies, and rascals, and friends, friends perhaps more than
enemies."
"When the first contemptible anonymous letter was sent to me,
Pyotr Stepanovitch, you'll hardly believe it, but I had not strength
enough to treat all this wickedness with contempt...."
"I shall never,
never forgive myself for my weakness."""
"""I had heard something of anonymous letters here already,"" said Pyotr
Stepanovitch, growing suddenly more lively, ""and I'll find out the
writers of them, you may be sure."""
"""But you can't imagine the intrigues that have been got up here."
"They
have even been pestering our poor Praskovya Ivanovna, and what reason
can they have for worrying her?"
"I was quite unfair to you to-day
perhaps, my dear Praskovya Ivanovna,"" she added in a generous impulse of
kindliness, though not without a certain triumphant irony."
"""Don't say any more, my dear,"" the other lady muttered reluctantly."
"""To my thinking we'd better make an end of all this; too much has been
said."""
"And again she looked timidly towards Liza, but the latter was looking at
Pyotr Stepanovitch."
"""And I intend now to adopt this poor unhappy creature, this insane
woman who has lost everything and kept only her heart,"" Varvara Petrovna
exclaimed suddenly."
"""It's a sacred duty I intend to carry out."
"I take
her under my protection from this day."""
"""And that will be a very good thing in one way,"" Pyotr Stepanovitch
cried, growing quite eager again."
"""Excuse me, I did not finish just now."
It's just the care of her I want to speak of.
"Would you believe it, that
as soon as Nikolay Vsyevolodovitch had gone (I'm beginning from where
I left off, Varvara Petrovna), this gentleman here, this Mr. Lebyadkin,
instantly imagined he had the right to dispose of the whole pension
that was provided for his sister."
And he did dispose of it.
"I don't
know exactly how it had been arranged by Nikolay Vsyevolodovitch at that
time."
"But a year later, when he learned from abroad what had happened,
he was obliged to make other arrangements."
"Again, I don't know the
details; he'll tell you them himself."
"I only know that the interesting
young person was placed somewhere in a remote nunnery, in very
comfortable surroundings, but under friendly superintendence--you
understand?"
But what do you think Mr. Lebyadkin made up his mind to do?
"He exerted himself to the utmost, to begin with, to find where
his source of income, that is his sister, was hidden."
"Only lately he
attained his object, took her from the nunnery, asserting some claim to
her, and brought her straight here."
"Here he doesn't feed her properly,
beats her, and bullies her."
"As soon as by some means he gets a
considerable sum from Nikolay Vsyevolodovitch, he does nothing but
get drunk, and instead of gratitude ends by impudently defying Nikolay
Vsyevolodovitch, making senseless demands, threatening him with
proceedings if the pension is not paid straight into his hands."
"So
he takes what is a voluntary gift from Nikolay Vsyevolodovitch as a
tax--can you imagine it?"
"Mr. Lebyadkin, is that all true that I have
said just now?"""
"The captain, who had till that moment stood in silence looking down,
took two rapid steps forward and turned crimson."
"""Pyotr Stepanovitch, you've treated me cruelly,"" he brought out
abruptly."
"""Why cruelly?"
How?
"But allow us to discuss the question of cruelty or
gentleness later on."
"Now answer my first question; is it true all that I
have said or not?"
"If you consider it's false you are at liberty to give
your own version at once."""
"""I... you know yourself, Pyotr Stepanovitch,"" the captain muttered, but
he could not go on and relapsed into silence."
"It must be observed that
Pyotr Stepanovitch was sitting in an easy chair with one leg crossed
over the other, while the captain stood before him in the most
respectful attitude."
"Lebyadkin's hesitation seemed to annoy Pyotr Stepanovitch; a spasm of
anger distorted his face."
"""Then you have a statement you want to make?"""
"he said, looking subtly at
the captain."
"""Kindly speak."
"We're waiting for you."""
"""You know yourself Pyotr Stepanovitch, that I can't say anything."""
"""No, I don't know it."
It's the first time I've heard it.
"Why can't you
speak?"""
"The captain was silent, with his eyes on the ground."
"""Allow me to go, Pyotr Stepanovitch,"" he brought out resolutely."
"""No, not till you answer my question: is it all true that I've said?"""
"""It is true,"" Lebyadkin brought out in a hollow voice, looking at his
tormentor."
Drops of perspiration stood out on his forehead.
"""Is it _all_ true?"""
"""It's all true."""
"""Have you nothing to add or to observe?"
"If you think that we've been
unjust, say so; protest, state your grievance aloud."""
"""No, I think nothing."""
"""Did you threaten Nikolay Vsyevolodovitch lately?"""
"""It was... it was more drink than anything, Pyotr Stepanovitch."""
"He
suddenly raised his head."
"""If family honour and undeserved disgrace
cry out among men then--then is a man to blame?"""
"he roared suddenly,
forgetting himself as before."
"""Are you sober now, Mr."
"Lebyadkin?"""
Pyotr Stepanovitch looked at him penetratingly.
"""I am..."
"sober."""
"""What do you mean by family honour and undeserved disgrace?"""
"""I didn't mean anybody, anybody at all."
"I meant myself,"" the captain
said, collapsing again."
"""You seem to be very much offended by what I've said about you and your
conduct?"
"You are very irritable, Mr. Lebyadkin."
"But let me tell you I've
hardly begun yet what I've got to say about your conduct, in its real
sense."
I'll begin to discuss your conduct in its real sense.
"I shall
begin, that may very well happen, but so far I've not begun, in a real
sense."""
Lebyadkin started and stared wildly at Pyotr Stepanovitch.
"""Pyotr Stepanovitch, I am just beginning to wake up."""
"""H'm!"
"And it's I who have waked you up?"""
"""Yes, it's you who have waked me, Pyotr Stepanovitch; and I've been
asleep for the last four years with a storm-cloud hanging over me."
"May I
withdraw at last, Pyotr Stepanovitch?"""
"""Now you may, unless Varvara Petrovna thinks it necessary...""

But the latter dismissed him with a wave of her hand."
"The captain bowed, took two steps towards the door, stopped suddenly,
laid his hand on his heart, tried to say something, did not say it, and
was moving quickly away."
"But in the doorway he came face to face with
Nikolay Vsyevolodovitch; the latter stood aside."
"The captain shrank into
himself, as it were, before him, and stood as though frozen to the spot,
his eyes fixed upon him like a rabbit before a boa-constrictor."
"After
a little pause Nikolay Vsyevolodovitch waved him aside with a slight
motion of his hand, and walked into the drawing-room."
"VII

He was cheerful and serene."
"Perhaps something very pleasant had happened
to him, of which we knew nothing as yet; but he seemed particularly
contented."
"""Do you forgive me, Nicolas?"""
"Varvara Petrovna hastened to say, and got
up suddenly to meet him."
But Nicolas positively laughed.
"""Just as I thought,"" he said, good-humouredly and jestingly."
"""I see you
know all about it already."
"When I had gone from here I reflected in the
carriage that I ought at least to have told you the story instead of
going off like that."
"But when I remembered that Pyotr Stepanovitch was
still here, I thought no more of it."""
As he spoke he took a cursory look round.
"""Pyotr Stepanovitch told us an old Petersburg episode in the life of a
queer fellow,"" Varvara Petrovna rejoined enthusiastically--""a mad
and capricious fellow, though always lofty in his feelings, always
chivalrous and noble....""

""Chivalrous?"
"You don't mean to say it's come to that,"" laughed Nicolas."
"""However, I'm very grateful to Pyotr Stepanovitch for being in such a
hurry this time."""
He exchanged a rapid glance with the latter.
"""You must
know, maman, that Pyotr Stepanovitch is the universal peacemaker; that's
his part in life, his weakness, his hobby, and I particularly recommend
him to you from that point of view."
"I can guess what a yarn he's
been spinning."
"He's a great hand at spinning them; he has a perfect
record-office in his head."
"He's such a realist, you know, that he can't
tell a lie, and prefers truthfulness to effect... except, of course,
in special cases when effect is more important than truth."""
"(As he said
this he was still looking about him.)"
"""So, you see clearly, maman, that
it's not for you to ask my forgiveness, and if there's any craziness
about this affair it's my fault, and it proves that, when all's said and
done, I really am mad...."
"I must keep up my character here....""

Then he tenderly embraced his mother."
"""In any case the subject has been fully discussed and is done with,""
he added, and there was a rather dry and resolute note in his voice."
"Varvara Petrovna understood that note, but her exaltation was not
damped, quite the contrary."
"""I didn't expect you for another month, Nicolas!"""
"""I will explain everything to you, maman, of course, but now...""

And he went towards Praskovya Ivanovna."
"But she scarcely turned her head towards him, though she had been
completely overwhelmed by his first appearance."
"Now she had fresh
anxieties to think of; at the moment the captain had stumbled upon
Nikolay Vsyevolodovitch as he was going out, Liza had suddenly begun
laughing--at first quietly and intermittently, but her laughter grew
more and more violent, louder and more conspicuous."
"She flushed crimson,
in striking contrast with her gloomy expression just before."
"While Nikolay Vsyevolodovitch was talking to Varvara Petrovna, she had
twice beckoned to Mavriky Nikolaevitch as though she wanted to whisper
something to him; but as soon as the young man bent down to her, she
instantly burst into laughter; so that it seemed as though it was at
poor Mavriky Nikolaevitch that she was laughing."
"She evidently tried to
control herself, however, and put her handkerchief to her lips."
"Nikolay Vsyevolodovitch turned to greet her with a most innocent and
open-hearted air."
"""Please excuse me,"" she responded, speaking quickly."
"""You... you've seen
Mavriky Nikolaevitch of course.... My goodness, how inexcusably tall you
are, Mavriky Nikolaevitch!"""
"And laughter again, Mavriky Nikolaevitch was tall, but by no means
inexcusably so."
"""Have... you been here long?"""
"she muttered, restraining herself again,
genuinely embarrassed though her eyes were shining."
"""More than two hours,"" answered Nicolas, looking at her intently."
"I may
remark that he was exceptionally reserved and courteous, but that apart
from his courtesy his expression was utterly indifferent, even listless."
"""And where are you going to stay?"""
"""Here."""
"Varvara Petrovna, too, was watching Liza, but she was suddenly struck by
an idea."
"""Where have you been all this time, Nicolas, more than two hours?"""
"she
said, going up to him."
"""The train comes in at ten o'clock."""
"""I first took Pyotr Stepanovitch to Kirillov's."
"I came across Pyotr
Stepanovitch at Matveyev (three stations away), and we travelled
together."""
"""I had been waiting at Matveyev since sunrise,"" put in Pyotr
Stepanovitch."
"""The last carriages of our train ran off the rails in the
night, and we nearly had our legs broken."""
"""Your legs broken!"""
cried Liza.
"""Maman, maman, you and I meant to go to
Matveyev last week, we should have broken our legs too!"""
"""Heaven have mercy on us!"""
"cried Praskovya Ivanovna, crossing herself."
"""Maman, maman, dear maman, you mustn't be frightened if I break both my
legs."
"It may so easily happen to me; you say yourself that I ride so
recklessly every day."
"Mavriky Nikolaevitch, will you go about with me
when I'm lame?"""
She began giggling again.
"""If it does happen I won't let
anyone take me about but you, you can reckon on that.... Well, suppose I
break only one leg."
"Come, be polite, say you'll think it a pleasure."""
"""A pleasure to be crippled?"""
"said Mavriky Nikolaevitch, frowning
gravely."
"""But then you'll lead me about, only you and no one else."""
"""Even then it'll be you leading me about, Lizaveta Nikolaevna,""
murmured Mavriky Nikolaevitch, even more gravely."
"""Why, he's trying to make a joke!"""
"cried Liza, almost in dismay."
"""Mavriky Nikolaevitch, don't you ever dare take to that!"
"But what an
egoist you are!"
"I am certain that, to your credit, you're slandering
yourself."
"It will be quite the contrary; from morning till night you'll
assure me that I have become more charming for having lost my leg."
"There's one insurmountable difficulty--you're so fearfully tall, and
when I've lost my leg I shall be so very tiny."
"How will you be able to
take me on your arm; we shall look a strange couple!"""
And she laughed hysterically.
"Her jests and insinuations were feeble,
but she was not capable of considering the effect she was producing."
"""Hysterics!"""
Pyotr Stepanovitch whispered to me.
"""A glass of water, make
haste!"""
He was right.
"A minute later every one was fussing about, water was
brought."
"Liza embraced her mother, kissed her warmly, wept on her
shoulder, then drawing back and looking her in the face she fell to
laughing again."
The mother too began whimpering.
"Varvara Petrovna made
haste to carry them both off to her own rooms, going out by the same
door by which Darya Pavlovna had come to us."
"But they were not away
long, not more than four minutes."
"I am trying to remember now every detail of these last moments of that
memorable morning."
"I remember that when we were left without the ladies
(except Darya Pavlovna, who had not moved from her seat), Nikolay
Vsyevolodovitch made the round, greeting us all except Shatov, who still
sat in his corner, his head more bowed than ever."
"Stepan Trofimovitch
was beginning something very witty to Nikolay Vsyevolodovitch, but the
latter turned away hurriedly to Darya Pavlovna."
"But before he reached
her, Pyotr Stepanovitch caught him and drew him away, almost violently,
towards the window, where he whispered something quickly to him,
apparently something very important to judge by the expression of
his face and the gestures that accompanied the whisper."
"Nikolay
Vsyevolodovitch listened inattentively and listlessly with his official
smile, and at last even impatiently, and seemed all the time on the
point of breaking away."
"He moved away from the window just as the ladies
came back."
"Varvara Petrovna made Liza sit down in the same seat as
before, declaring that she must wait and rest another ten minutes; and
that the fresh air would perhaps be too much for her nerves at once."
"She was looking after Liza with great devotion, and sat down beside
her."
"Pyotr Stepanovitch, now disengaged, skipped up to them at once,
and broke into a rapid and lively flow of conversation."
"At that point
Nikolay Vsyevolodovitch at last went up to Darya Pavlovna with his
leisurely step."
"Dasha began stirring uneasily at his approach, and
jumped up quickly in evident embarrassment, flushing all over her face."
"""I believe one may congratulate you... or is it too soon?"""
"he brought
out with a peculiar line in his face."
"Dasha made him some answer, but it was difficult to catch it."
"""Forgive my indiscretion,"" he added, raising his voice, ""but you know I
was expressly informed."
"Did you know about it?"""
"""Yes, I know that you were expressly informed."""
"""But I hope I have not done any harm by my congratulations,"" he laughed."
"""And if Stepan Trofimovitch...""

""What, what's the congratulation about?"""
"Pyotr Stepanovitch suddenly
skipped up to them."
"""What are you being congratulated about, Darya
Pavlovna?"
Bah!
Surely that's not it?
"Your blush proves I've guessed
right."
"And indeed, what else does one congratulate our charming and
virtuous young ladies on?"
"And what congratulations make them blush most
readily?"
"Well, accept mine too, then, if I've guessed right!"
"And pay
up."
"Do you remember when we were in Switzerland you bet you'd never be
married.... Oh, yes, apropos of Switzerland--what am I thinking about?"
"Only fancy, that's half what I came about, and I was almost forgetting
it."
"Tell me,"" he turned quickly to Stepan Trofimovitch, ""when are you
going to Switzerland?"""
"""I... to Switzerland?"""
"Stepan Trofimovitch replied, wondering and
confused."
"""What?"
Aren't you going?
"Why you're getting married, too, you wrote?"""
"_""Pierre!"
"""_ cried Stepan Trofimovitch."
"""Well, why Pierre?..."
"You see, if that'll please you, I've flown here to
announce that I'm not at all against it, since you were set on having
my opinion as quickly as possible; and if, indeed,"" he pattered on, ""you
want to 'be saved,' as you wrote, beseeching my help in the same letter,
I am at your service again."
"Is it true that he is going to be married,
Varvara Petrovna?"""
He turned quickly to her.
"""I hope I'm not being
indiscreet; he writes himself that the whole town knows it and every
one's congratulating him, so that, to avoid it he only goes out at
night."
I've got his letters in my pocket.
"But would you believe it,
Varvara Petrovna, I can't make head or tail of it?"
"Just tell me one
thing, Stepan Trofimovitch, are you to be congratulated or are you to
be 'saved'?"
"You wouldn't believe it; in one line he's despairing and in
the next he's most joyful."
"To begin with he begs my forgiveness; well,
of course, that's their way... though it must be said; fancy, the man's
only seen me twice in his life and then by accident."
"And suddenly now,
when he's going to be married for the third time, he imagines that
this is a breach of some sort of parental duty to me, and entreats me a
thousand miles away not to be angry and to allow him to."
"Please don't
be hurt, Stepan Trofimovitch."
"It's characteristic of your generation,
I take a broad view of it, and don't blame you."
"And let's admit it does
you honour and all the rest."
"But the point is again that I don't see the
point of it."
There's something about some sort of 'sins in Switzerland.'
"'I'm getting married,' he says, 'for my sins or on account of the 'sins'
of another,' or whatever it is--'sins' anyway."
"'The girl,' says he, 'is
a pearl and a diamond,' and, well, of course, he's 'unworthy of her';
it's their way of talking; but on account of some sins or circumstances
'he is obliged to lead her to the altar, and go to Switzerland, and
therefore abandon everything and fly to save me.'"
"Do you understand
anything of all that?"
"However... however, I notice from the expression
of your faces""--(he turned about with the letter in his hand looking
with an innocent smile into the faces of the company)--""that, as usual,
I seem to have put my foot in it through my stupid way of being open,
or, as Nikolay Vsyevolodovitch says, 'being in a hurry.'"
"I thought, of
course, that we were all friends here, that is, your friends, Stepan
Trofimovitch, your friends."
"I am really a stranger, and I see... and I
see that you all know something, and that just that something I don't
know."""
He still went on looking about him.
"""So Stepan Trofimovitch wrote to you that he was getting married for
the 'sins of another committed in Switzerland,' and that you were to
fly here 'to save him,' in those very words?"""
"said Varvara Petrovna,
addressing him suddenly."
"Her face was yellow and distorted, and her lips
were twitching."
"""Well, you see, if there's anything I've not understood,"" said Pyotr
Stepanovitch, as though in alarm, talking more quickly than ever, ""it's
his fault, of course, for writing like that."
Here's the letter.
"You
know, Varvara Petrovna, his letters are endless and incessant, and,
you know, for the last two or three months there has been letter upon
letter, till, I must own, at last I sometimes didn't read them through."
"Forgive me, Stepan Trofimovitch, for my foolish confession, but you must
admit, please, that, though you addressed them to me, you wrote them
more for posterity, so that you really can't mind.... Come, come, don't
be offended; we're friends, anyway."
"But this letter, Varvara Petrovna,
this letter, I did read through."
"These 'sins'--these 'sins of
another'--are probably some little sins of our own, and I don't mind
betting very innocent ones, though they have suddenly made us take a
fancy to work up a terrible story, with a glamour of the heroic about
it; and it's just for the sake of that glamour we've got it up."
"You
see there's something a little lame about our accounts--it must be
confessed, in the end."
"We've a great weakness for cards, you know...."
"But this is unnecessary, quite unnecessary, I'm sorry, I chatter too
much."
"But upon my word, Varvara Petrovna, he gave me a fright, and I
really was half prepared to save him."
He really made me feel ashamed.
"Did he expect me to hold a knife to his throat, or what?"
"Am I such a
merciless creditor?"
He writes something here of a dowry....
"But are you
really going to get married, Stepan Trofimovitch?"
"That would be just
like you, to say a lot for the sake of talking."
"Ach, Varvara Petrovna,
I'm sure you must be blaming me now, and just for my way of talking
too....""

""On the contrary, on the contrary, I see that you are driven out of
all patience, and, no doubt you have had good reason,"" Varvara Petrovna
answered spitefully."
"She had listened with spiteful enjoyment to all the
""candid outbursts"" of Pyotr Stepanovitch, who was obviously playing
a part (what part I did not know then, but it was unmistakable, and
over-acted indeed)."
"""On the contrary,"" she went on, ""I'm only too grateful to you for
speaking; but for you I might not have known of it."
"My eyes are opened
for the first time for twenty years."
"Nikolay Vsyevolodovitch, you
said just now that you had been expressly informed; surely Stepan
Trofimovitch hasn't written to you in the same style?"""
"""I did get a very harmless and... and... very generous letter from
him....""

""You hesitate, you pick out your words."
That's enough!
"Stepan
Trofimovitch, I request a great favour from you."""
"She suddenly turned to
him with flashing eyes."
"""Kindly leave us at once, and never set foot in
my house again."""
"I must beg the reader to remember her recent ""exaltation,"" which had not
yet passed."
It's true that Stepan Trofimovitch was terribly to blame!
"But what was a complete surprise to me then was the wonderful dignity of
his bearing under his son's ""accusation,"" which he had never thought of
interrupting, and before Varvara Petrovna's ""denunciation."""
"How did he
come by such spirit?"
"I only found out one thing, that he had certainly
been deeply wounded at his first meeting with Petrusha, by the way he
had embraced him."
"It was a deep and genuine grief; at least in his eyes
and to his heart."
"He had another grief at the same time, that is the
poignant consciousness of having acted contemptibly."
"He admitted this
to me afterwards with perfect openness."
"And you know real genuine sorrow
will sometimes make even a phenomenally frivolous, unstable man solid
and stoical; for a short time at any rate; what's more, even fools are
by genuine sorrow turned into wise men, also only for a short time of
course; it is characteristic of sorrow."
"And if so, what might not
happen with a man like Stepan Trofimovitch?"
"It worked a complete
transformation--though also only for a time, of course."
"He bowed with dignity to Varvara Petrovna without uttering a word (there
was nothing else left for him to do, indeed)."
"He was on the point of
going out without a word, but could not refrain from approaching Darya
Pavlovna."
"She seemed to foresee that he would do so, for she began
speaking of her own accord herself, in utter dismay, as though in haste
to anticipate him."
"""Please, Stepan Trofimovitch, for God's sake, don't say anything,"" she
began, speaking with haste and excitement, with a look of pain in her
face, hurriedly stretching out her hands to him."
"""Be sure that I still
respect you as much... and think just as highly of you, and... think
well of me too, Stepan Trofimovitch, that will mean a great deal to me,
a great deal....""

Stepan Trofimovitch made her a very, very low bow."
"""It's for you to decide, Darya Pavlovna; you know that you are perfectly
free in the whole matter!"
"You have been, and you are now, and you always
will be,"" Varvara Petrovna concluded impressively."
"""Bah!"
"Now I understand it all!"""
"cried Pyotr Stepanovitch, slapping
himself on the forehead."
"""But... but what a position I am put in by
all this!"
"Darya Pavlovna, please forgive me!..."
"What do you call your
treatment of me, eh?"""
"he said, addressing his father."
"""Pierre, you might speak to me differently, mightn't you, my boy,""
Stepan Trofimovitch observed quite quietly."
"""Don't cry out, please,"" said Pierre, with a wave of his hand."
"""Believe
me, it's all your sick old nerves, and crying out will do no good at
all."
"You'd better tell me instead, why didn't you warn me since you
might have supposed I should speak out at the first chance?"""
Stepan Trofimovitch looked searchingly at him.
"""Pierre, you who know so much of what goes on here, can you really have
known nothing of this business and have heard nothing about it?"""
"""What?"
What a set!
"So it's not enough to be a child in your old age,
you must be a spiteful child too!"
"Varvara Petrovna, did you hear what he
said?"""
"There was a general outcry; but then suddenly an incident took place
which no one could have anticipated."
"VIII

First of all I must mention that, for the last two or three minutes
Lizaveta Nikolaevna had seemed to be possessed by a new impulse; she
was whispering something hurriedly to her mother, and to Mavriky
Nikolaevitch, who bent down to listen."
"Her face was agitated, but at the
same time it had a look of resolution."
"At last she got up from her
seat in evident haste to go away, and hurried her mother whom Mavriky
Nikolaevitch began helping up from her low chair."
"But it seemed they
were not destined to get away without seeing everything to the end."
"Shatov, who had been forgotten by every one in his corner (not far from
Lizaveta Nikolaevna), and who did not seem to know himself why he went
on sitting there, got up from his chair, and walked, without haste, with
resolute steps right across the room to Nikolay Vsyevolodovitch, looking
him straight in the face."
"The latter noticed him approaching at some
distance, and faintly smiled, but when Shatov was close to him he left
off smiling."
"When Shatov stood still facing him with his eyes fixed on him, and
without uttering a word, every one suddenly noticed it and there was a
general hush; Pyotr Stepanovitch was the last to cease speaking."
"Liza
and her mother were standing in the middle of the room."
"So passed five
seconds; the look of haughty astonishment was followed by one of anger
on Nikolay Vsyevolodovitch's face; he scowled....

And suddenly Shatov swung his long, heavy arm, and with all his might
struck him a blow in the face."
"Nikolay Vsyevolodovitch staggered
violently."
"Shatov struck the blow in a peculiar way, not at all after the
conventional fashion (if one may use such an expression)."
"It was not a
slap with the palm of his hand, but a blow with the whole fist, and it
was a big, heavy, bony fist covered with red hairs and freckles."
"If the
blow had struck the nose, it would have broken it."
"But it hit him on the
cheek, and struck the left corner of the lip and the upper teeth, from
which blood streamed at once."
"I believe there was a sudden scream, perhaps Varvara Petrovna
screamed--that I don't remember, because there was a dead hush again;
the whole scene did not last more than ten seconds, however."
Yet a very great deal happened in those seconds.
"I must remind the reader again that Nikolay Vsyevolodovitch's was one
of those natures that know nothing of fear."
"At a duel he could face the
pistol of his opponent with indifference, and could take aim and kill
with brutal coolness."
"If anyone had slapped him in the face, I should
have expected him not to challenge his assailant to a duel, but to
murder him on the spot."
"He was just one of those characters, and would
have killed the man, knowing very well what he was doing, and without
losing his self-control."
"I fancy, indeed, that he never was liable to
those fits of blind rage which deprive a man of all power of reflection."
"Even when overcome with intense anger, as he sometimes was, he was
always able to retain complete self-control, and therefore to realise
that he would certainly be sent to penal servitude for murdering a man
not in a duel; nevertheless, he'd have killed any one who insulted him,
and without the faintest hesitation."
"I have been studying Nikolay Vsyevolodovitch of late, and through
special circumstances I know a great many facts about him now, at the
time I write."
"I should compare him, perhaps, with some gentlemen of the
past of whom legendary traditions are still perceived among us."
"We are
told, for instance, about the Decabrist L--n, that he was always seeking
for danger, that he revelled in the sensation, and that it had become
a craving of his nature; that in his youth he had rushed into duels for
nothing; that in Siberia he used to go to kill bears with nothing but
a knife; that in the Siberian forests he liked to meet with runaway
convicts, who are, I may observe in passing, more formidable than bears."
"There is no doubt that these legendary gentlemen were capable of a
feeling of fear, and even to an extreme degree, perhaps, or they would
have been a great deal quieter, and a sense of danger would never have
become a physical craving with them."
"But the conquest of fear was
what fascinated them."
"The continual ecstasy of vanquishing and the
consciousness that no one could vanquish them was what attracted them."
"The same L---n struggled with hunger for some time before he was sent
into exile, and toiled to earn his daily bread simply because he did not
care to comply with the requests of his rich father, which he considered
unjust."
"So his conception of struggle was many-sided, and he did not
prize stoicism and strength of character only in duels and bear-fights."
"But many years have passed since those times, and the nervous,
exhausted, complex character of the men of to-day is incompatible with
the craving for those direct and unmixed sensations which were so sought
after by some restlessly active gentlemen of the good old days."
"Nikolay
Vsyevolodovitch would, perhaps, have looked down on L--n, and have
called him a boastful cock-a-hoop coward; it's true he wouldn't have
expressed himself aloud."
"Stavrogin would have shot his opponent in a
duel, and would have faced a bear if necessary, and would have defended
himself from a brigand in the forest as successfully and as fearlessly
as L--n, but it would be without the slightest thrill of enjoyment,
languidly, listlessly, even with ennui and entirely from unpleasant
necessity."
"In anger, of course, there has been a progress compared with
L--n, even compared with Lermontov."
"There was perhaps more malignant
anger in Nikolay Vsyevolodovitch than in both put together, but it was a
calm, cold, if one may so say, _reasonable_ anger, and therefore the most
revolting and most terrible possible."
"I repeat again, I considered him
then, and I still consider him (now that everything is over), a man who,
if he received a slap in the face, or any equivalent insult, would be
certain to kill his assailant at once, on the spot, without challenging
him."
"Yet, in the present case, what happened was something different and
amazing."
"He had scarcely regained his balance after being almost knocked over in
this humiliating way, and the horrible, as it were, sodden, thud of
the blow in the face had scarcely died away in the room when he seized
Shatov by the shoulders with both hands, but at once, almost at the same
instant, pulled both hands away and clasped them behind his back."
"He did
not speak, but looked at Shatov, and turned as white as his shirt."
"But,
strange to say, the light in his eyes seemed to die out."
"Ten seconds
later his eyes looked cold, and I'm sure I'm not lying--calm."
"Only he
was terribly pale."
"Of course I don't know what was passing within the
man, I saw only his exterior."
"It seems to me that if a man should snatch
up a bar of red-hot iron and hold it tight in his hand to test his
fortitude, and after struggling for ten seconds with insufferable pain
end by overcoming it, such a man would, I fancy, go through something
like what Nikolay Vsyevolodovitch was enduring during those ten seconds."
"Shatov was the first to drop his eyes, and evidently because he was
unable to go on facing him; then he turned slowly and walked out of the
room, but with a very different step."
"He withdrew quietly, with peculiar
awkwardness, with his shoulders hunched, his head hanging as though
he were inwardly pondering something."
"I believe he was whispering
something."
"He made his way to the door carefully, without stumbling
against anything or knocking anything over; he opened the door a very
little way, and squeezed through almost sideways."
"As he went out his
shock of hair standing on end at the back of his head was particularly
noticeable."
Then first of all one fearful scream was heard.
"I saw Lizaveta
Nikolaevna seize her mother by the shoulder and Mavriky Nikolaevitch by
the arm and make two or three violent efforts to draw them out of the
room."
"But she suddenly uttered a shriek, and fell full length on the
floor, fainting."
"I can hear the thud of her head on the carpet to this
day."
"PART II




CHAPTER I."
"NIGHT


I

EIGHT DAYS HAD PASSED."
"Now that it is all over and I am writing a record
of it, we know all about it; but at the time we knew nothing, and it was
natural that many things should seem strange to us: Stepan Trofimovitch
and I, anyway, shut ourselves up for the first part of the time, and
looked on with dismay from a distance."
"I did, indeed, go about here and
there, and, as before, brought him various items of news, without which
he could not exist."
"I need hardly say that there were rumours of the most varied kind
going about the town in regard to the blow that Stavrogin had received,
Lizaveta Nikolaevna's fainting fit, and all that happened on that
Sunday."
"But what we wondered was, through whom the story had got about
so quickly and so accurately."
"Not one of the persons present had any
need to give away the secret of what had happened, or interest to serve
by doing so."
The servants had not been present.
"Lebyadkin was the only one who might
have chattered, not so much from spite, for he had gone out in great
alarm (and fear of an enemy destroys spite against him), but simply from
incontinence of speech."
"But Lebyadkin and his sister had disappeared next
day, and nothing could be heard of them."
"There was no trace of them at
Filipov's house, they had moved, no one knew where, and seemed to have
vanished."
"Shatov, of whom I wanted to inquire about Marya Timofyevna,
would not open his door, and I believe sat locked up in his room for the
whole of those eight days, even discontinuing his work in the town."
"He
would not see me."
I went to see him on Tuesday and knocked at his door.
"I got no answer, but being convinced by unmistakable evidence that he
was at home, I knocked a second time."
"Then, jumping up, apparently from
his bed, he strode to the door and shouted at the top of his voice:

""Shatov is not at home!"""
With that I went away.
"Stepan Trofimovitch and I, not without dismay at the boldness of the
supposition, though we tried to encourage one another, reached at last
a conclusion: we made up our mind that the only person who could be
responsible for spreading these rumours was Pyotr Stepanovitch, though
he himself not long after assured his father that he had found the story
on every one's lips, especially at the club, and that the governor
and his wife were familiar with every detail of it."
"What is even more
remarkable is that the next day, Monday evening, I met Liputin, and
he knew every word that had been passed, so that he must have heard it
first-hand."
"Many of the ladies (and some of the leading ones) were
very inquisitive about the ""mysterious cripple,"" as they called Marya
Timofyevna."
"There were some, indeed, who were anxious to see her and
make her acquaintance, so the intervention of the persons who had
been in such haste to conceal the Lebyadkins was timely."
"But Lizaveta
Nikolaevna's fainting certainly took the foremost place in the story,
and ""all society"" was interested, if only because it directly concerned
Yulia Mihailovna, as the kinswoman and patroness of the young lady."
And what was there they didn't say!
"What increased the gossip was the
mysterious position of affairs; both houses were obstinately closed;
Lizaveta Nikolaevna, so they said, was in bed with brain fever."
"The
same thing was asserted of Nikolay Vsyevolodovitch, with the revolting
addition of a tooth knocked out and a swollen face."
"It was even
whispered in corners that there would soon be murder among us, that
Stavrogin was not the man to put up with such an insult, and that he
would kill Shatov, but with the secrecy of a Corsican vendetta."
"People
liked this idea, but the majority of our young people listened with
contempt, and with an air of the most nonchalant indifference, which
was, of course, assumed."
"The old hostility to Nikolay Vsyevolodovitch
in the town was in general strikingly manifest."
"Even sober-minded people
were eager to throw blame on him though they could not have said
for what."
"It was whispered that he had ruined Lizaveta Nikolaevna's
reputation, and that there had been an intrigue between them in
Switzerland."
"Cautious people, of course, restrained themselves, but
all listened with relish."
"There were other things said, though not
in public, but in private, on rare occasions and almost in secret,
extremely strange things, to which I only refer to warn my readers of
them with a view to the later events of my story."
"Some people, with
knitted brows, said, God knows on what foundation, that Nikolay
Vsyevolodovitch had some special business in our province, that he
had, through Count K., been brought into touch with exalted circles in
Petersburg, that he was even, perhaps, in government service, and might
almost be said to have been furnished with some sort of commission from
someone."
"When very sober-minded and sensible people smiled at this
rumour, observing very reasonably that a man always mixed up with
scandals, and who was beginning his career among us with a swollen face
did not look like a government official, they were told in a whisper
that he was employed not in the official, but, so to say, the
confidential service, and that in such cases it was essential to be as
little like an official as possible."
"This remark produced a sensation;
we knew that the Zemstvo of our province was the object of marked
attention in the capital."
"I repeat, these were only flitting rumours
that disappeared for a time when Nikolay Vsyevolodovitch first came
among us."
"But I may observe that many of the rumours were partly due to
a few brief but malicious words, vaguely and disconnectedly dropped at
the club by a gentleman who had lately returned from Petersburg."
"This
was a retired captain in the guards, Artemy Pavlovitch Gaganov."
"He was
a very large landowner in our province and district, a man used to the
society of Petersburg, and a son of the late Pavel Pavlovitch Gaganov,
the venerable old man with whom Nikolay Vsyevolodovitch had, over four
years before, had the extraordinarily coarse and sudden encounter which
I have described already in the beginning of my story."
"It immediately became known to every one that Yulia Mihailovna had
made a special call on Varvara Petrovna, and had been informed at the
entrance: ""Her honour was too unwell to see visitors."""
"It was known,
too, that Yulia Mihailovna sent a message two days later to inquire
after Varvara Petrovna's health."
"At last she began ""defending"" Varvara
Petrovna everywhere, of course only in the loftiest sense, that is, in
the vaguest possible way."
"She listened coldly and sternly to the hurried
remarks made at first about the scene on Sunday, so that during the
later days they were not renewed in her presence."
"So that the belief
gained ground everywhere that Yulia Mihailovna knew not only the whole
of the mysterious story but all its secret significance to the smallest
detail, and not as an outsider, but as one taking part in it."
"I may
observe, by the way, that she was already gradually beginning to gain
that exalted influence among us for which she was so eager and which
she was certainly struggling to win, and was already beginning to see
herself ""surrounded by a circle."""
"A section of society recognised her
practical sense and tact... but of that later."
"Her patronage partly
explained Pyotr Stepanovitch's rapid success in our society--a success
with which Stepan Trofimovitch was particularly impressed at the time."
We possibly exaggerated it.
"To begin with, Pyotr Stepanovitch seemed to
make acquaintance almost instantly with the whole town within the first
four days of his arrival."
"He only arrived on Sunday; and on Tuesday
I saw him in a carriage with Artemy Pavlovitch Gaganov, a man who was
proud, irritable, and supercilious, in spite of his good breeding,
and who was not easy to get on with."
"At the governor's, too, Pyotr
Stepanovitch met with a warm welcome, so much so that he was at once
on an intimate footing, like a young friend, treated, so to say,
affectionately."
He dined with Yulia Mihailovna almost every day.
"He had
made her acquaintance in Switzerland, but there was certainly something
curious about the rapidity of his success in the governor's house."
"In
any case he was reputed, whether truly or not, to have been at one
time a revolutionist abroad, he had had something to do with some
publications and some congresses abroad, ""which one can prove from the
newspapers,"" to quote the malicious remark of Alyosha Telyatnikov, who
had also been once a young friend affectionately treated in the house of
the late governor, but was now, alas, a clerk on the retired list."
"But
the fact was unmistakable: the former revolutionist, far from being
hindered from returning to his beloved Fatherland, seemed almost to have
been encouraged to do so, so perhaps there was nothing in it."
"Liputin
whispered to me once that there were rumours that Pyotr Stepanovitch had
once professed himself penitent, and on his return had been pardoned on
mentioning certain names and so, perhaps, had succeeded in expiating his
offence, by promising to be of use to the government in the future."
"I
repeated these malignant phrases to Stepan Trofimovitch, and although
the latter was in such a state that he was hardly capable of reflection,
he pondered profoundly."
"It turned out later that Pyotr Stepanovitch had
come to us with a very influential letter of recommendation, that
he had, at any rate, brought one to the governor's wife from a very
important old lady in Petersburg, whose husband was one of the most
distinguished old dignitaries in the capital."
"This old lady, who was
Yulia Mihailovna's godmother, mentioned in her letter that Count K. knew
Pyotr Stepanovitch very well through Nikolay Vsyevolodovitch, made much
of him, and thought him ""a very excellent young man in spite of his
former errors."""
"Yulia Mihailovna set the greatest value on her
relations with the ""higher spheres,"" which were few and maintained with
difficulty, and was, no doubt, pleased to get the old lady's letter, but
still there was something peculiar about it."
"She even forced her husband
upon a familiar footing with Pyotr Stepanovitch, so much so that Mr. von
Lembke complained of it... but of that, too, later."
"I may mention,
too, that the great author was also favourably disposed to Pyotr
Stepanovitch, and at once invited him to go and see him."
"Such alacrity
on the part of a man so puffed up with conceit stung Stepan Trofimovitch
more painfully than anything; but I put a different interpretation on
it."
"In inviting a nihilist to see him, Mr. Karmazinov, no doubt, had in
view his relations with the progressives of the younger generation
in both capitals."
"The great author trembled nervously before the
revolutionary youth of Russia, and imagining, in his ignorance, that the
future lay in their hands, fawned upon them in a despicable way, chiefly
because they paid no attention to him whatever."
"II

Pyotr Stepanovitch ran round to see his father twice, but unfortunately
I was absent on both occasions."
"He visited him for the first time
only on Wednesday, that is, not till the fourth day after their first
meeting, and then only on business."
"Their difficulties over the property
were settled, by the way, without fuss or publicity."
"Varvara Petrovna
took it all on herself, and paid all that was owing, taking over the
land, of course, and only informed Stepan Trofimovitch that it was all
settled and her butler, Alexey Yegorytch, was, by her authorisation,
bringing him something to sign."
"This Stepan Trofimovitch did, in
silence, with extreme dignity."
"Apropos of his dignity, I may mention
that I hardly recognised my old friend during those days."
"He behaved
as he had never done before; became amazingly taciturn and had not even
written one letter to Varvara Petrovna since Sunday, which seemed to me
almost a miracle."
"What's more, he had become quite calm."
"He had fastened
upon a final and decisive idea which gave him tranquillity."
"That was
evident."
"He had hit upon this idea, and sat still, expecting something."
"At first, however, he was ill, especially on Monday."
"He had an attack
of his summer cholera."
"He could not remain all that time without news
either; but as soon as I departed from the statement of facts, and began
discussing the case in itself, and formulated any theory, he at once
gesticulated to me to stop."
"But both his interviews with his son had a
distressing effect on him, though they did not shake his determination."
"After each interview he spent the whole day lying on the sofa with a
handkerchief soaked in vinegar on his head."
"But he continued to remain
calm in the deepest sense."
"Sometimes, however, he did not hinder my speaking."
"Sometimes, too, it
seemed to me that the mysterious determination he had taken seemed to
be failing him and he appeared to be struggling with a new, seductive
stream of ideas."
"That was only at moments, but I made a note of it."
"I
suspected that he was longing to assert himself again, to come forth
from his seclusion, to show fight, to struggle to the last."
"""_Cher,_ I could crush them!"""
"broke from him on Thursday evening after his
second interview with Pyotr Stepanovitch, when he lay stretched on the
sofa with his head wrapped in a towel."
Till that moment he had not uttered one word all day.
"_""Fils, fils, cher,""_ and so on, ""I agree all those expressions are
nonsense, kitchen talk, and so be it."
I see it for myself.
"I never gave
him food or drink, I sent him a tiny baby from Berlin to X province by
post, and all that, I admit it.... 'You gave me neither food nor drink,
and sent me by post,' he says, 'and what's more you've robbed me here.'"""
"""'But you unhappy boy,' I cried to him, 'my heart has been aching for
you all my life; though I did send you by post.'"
"_Il rit._""

""But I admit it."
"I admit it, granted it was by post,"" he concluded,
almost in delirium."
"_""Passons,""_ he began again, five minutes later."
"""I don't understand
Turgenev."
"That Bazarov of his is a fictitious figure, it does not exist
anywhere."
"The fellows themselves were the first to disown him as unlike
anyone."
"That Bazarov is a sort of indistinct mixture of Nozdryov and
Byron, _c'est le mot._ Look at them attentively: they caper about and
squeal with joy like puppies in the sun."
"They are happy, they are
victorious!"
What is there of Byron in them!...
"and with that, such
ordinariness!"
"What a low-bred, irritable vanity!"
"What an abject craving
to _faire du bruit autour de son nom,_ without noticing that _son
nom...._ Oh, it's a caricature!"
"'Surely,' I cried to him, 'you don't want
to offer yourself just as you are as a substitute for Christ?'"
_Il rit.
Il rit beaucoup.
Il rit trop._ He has a strange smile.
"His mother had not
a smile like that."
"_Il rit toujours._""

Silence followed again."
"""They are cunning; they were acting in collusion on Sunday,"" he blurted
out suddenly....

""Oh, not a doubt of it,"" I cried, pricking up my ears."
"""It was a got-up
thing and it was too transparent, and so badly acted."""
"""I don't mean that."
"Do you know that it was all too transparent
on purpose, that those... who had to, might understand it."
"Do you
understand that?"""
"""I don't understand."""
"""_Tant mieux; passons._ I am very irritable to-day."""
"""But why have you been arguing with him, Stepan Trofimovitch?"""
"I asked
him reproachfully."
"""_Je voulais convertir_--you'll laugh of course--_cette pauvre_ auntie,
_elle entendra de belles choses!_ Oh, my dear boy, would you believe it."
I felt like a patriot.
"I always recognised that I was a Russian,
however... a genuine Russian must be like you and me."
"_Il y a là dedans
quelque chose d'aveugle et de louche._""

""Not a doubt of it,"" I assented."
"""My dear, the real truth always sounds improbable, do you know that?"
"To
make truth sound probable you must always mix in some falsehood with it."
Men have always done so.
"Perhaps there's something in it that passes our
understanding."
"What do you think: is there something we don't understand
in that triumphant squeal?"
I should like to think there was.
"I should
like to think so."""
I did not speak.
"He, too, was silent for a long time."
"""They say that
French cleverness..."" he babbled suddenly, as though in a fever...
""that's false, it always has been."
Why libel French cleverness?
"It's
simply Russian indolence, our degrading impotence to produce ideas, our
revolting parasitism in the rank of nations."
"_Ils sont tout simplement
des paresseux,_ and not French cleverness."
"Oh, the Russians ought to be
extirpated for the good of humanity, like noxious parasites!"
"We've been
striving for something utterly, utterly different."
"I can make nothing of
it."
I have given up understanding.
"'Do you understand,' I cried to him,
'that if you have the guillotine in the foreground of your programme and
are so enthusiastic about it too, it's simply because nothing's easier
than cutting off heads, and nothing's harder than to have an idea."
"_Vous
êtes des paresseux!"
"Votre drapeau est un guenille, une impuissance._ It's
those carts, or, what was it?..."
"the rumble of the carts carrying bread
to humanity being more important than the Sistine Madonna, or, what's
the saying?..."
"_une bêtise dans ce genre._ Don't you understand, don't you
understand,' I said to him, 'that unhappiness is just as necessary to
man as happiness.'"
"_Il rit._ 'All you do is to make a _bon mot,_' he
said, 'with your limbs snug on a velvet sofa.'..."
"(He used a coarser
expression.)"
"And this habit of addressing a father so familiarly is very
nice when father and son are on good terms, but what do you think of it
when they are abusing one another?"""
We were silent again for a minute.
"_""Cher,""_ he concluded at last, getting up quickly, ""do you know this is
bound to end in something?"""
"""Of course,"" said I."
"""_Vous ne comprenez pas."
"Passons._ But... usually in our world things come
to nothing, but this will end in something; it's bound to, it's bound
to!"""
"He got up, and walked across the room in violent emotion, and coming
back to the sofa sank on to it exhausted."
"On Friday morning, Pyotr Stepanovitch went off somewhere in the
neighbourhood, and remained away till Monday."
"I heard of his departure
from Liputin, and in the course of conversation I learned that the
Lebyadkins, brother and sister, had moved to the riverside quarter."
"""I moved them,"" he added, and, dropping the Lebyadkins, he suddenly
announced to me that Lizaveta Nikolaevna was going to marry Mavriky
Nikolaevitch, that, although it had not been announced, the engagement
was a settled thing."
"Next day I met Lizaveta Nikolaevna out riding with
Mavriky Nikolaevitch; she was out for the first time after her illness."
"She beamed at me from the distance, laughed, and nodded in a very
friendly way."
"I told all this to Stepan Trofimovitch; he paid no
attention, except to the news about the Lebyadkins."
"And now, having described our enigmatic position throughout those eight
days during which we knew nothing, I will pass on to the description of
the succeeding incidents of my chronicle, writing, so to say, with full
knowledge, and describing things as they became known afterwards, and
are clearly seen to-day."
"I will begin with the eighth day after that
Sunday, that is, the Monday evening--for in reality a ""new scandal""
began with that evening."
"III

It was seven o'clock in the evening."
"Nikolay Vsyevolodovitch was sitting
alone in his study--the room he had been fond of in old days."
"It was
lofty, carpeted with rugs, and contained somewhat heavy old-fashioned
furniture."
"He was sitting on the sofa in the corner, dressed as though
to go out, though he did not seem to be intending to do so."
"On the table
before him stood a lamp with a shade."
"The sides and corners of the big
room were left in shadow."
"His eyes looked dreamy and concentrated,
not altogether tranquil; his face looked tired and had grown a little
thinner."
"He really was ill with a swollen face; but the story of a tooth
having been knocked out was an exaggeration."
"One had been loosened, but
it had grown into its place again: he had had a cut on the inner side of
the upper lip, but that, too, had healed."
"The swelling on his face had
lasted all the week simply because the invalid would not have a doctor,
and instead of having the swelling lanced had waited for it to go down."
"He would not hear of a doctor, and would scarcely allow even his mother
to come near him, and then only for a moment, once a day, and only at
dusk, after it was dark and before lights had been brought in."
"He did
not receive Pyotr Stepanovitch either, though the latter ran round to
Varvara Petrovna's two or three times a day so long as he remained in
the town."
"And now, at last, returning on the Monday morning after his
three days' absence, Pyotr Stepanovitch made a circuit of the town,
and, after dining at Yulia Mihailovna's, came at last in the evening to
Varvara Petrovna, who was impatiently expecting him."
"The interdict had
been removed, Nikolay Vsyevolodovitch was ""at home."""
"Varvara Petrovna
herself led the visitor to the door of the study; she had long looked
forward to their meeting, and Pyotr Stepanovitch had promised to run
to her and repeat what passed."
"She knocked timidly at Nikolay
Vsyevolodovitch's door, and getting no answer ventured to open the door
a couple of inches."
"""Nicolas, may I bring Pyotr Stepanovitch in to see you?"""
"she asked, in a
soft and restrained voice, trying to make out her son's face behind the
lamp."
"""You can--you can, of course you can,"" Pyotr Stepanovitch himself cried
out, loudly and gaily."
He opened the door with his hand and went in.
"Nikolay Vsyevolodovitch had not heard the knock at the door, and only
caught his mother's timid question, and had not had time to answer it."
"Before him, at that moment, there lay a letter he had just read over,
which he was pondering deeply."
"He started, hearing Pyotr Stepanovitch's
sudden outburst, and hurriedly put the letter under a paper-weight,
but did not quite succeed; a corner of the letter and almost the whole
envelope showed."
"""I called out on purpose that you might be prepared,"" Pyotr Stepanovitch
said hurriedly, with surprising naïveté, running up to the table, and
instantly staring at the corner of the letter, which peeped out from
beneath the paper-weight."
"""And no doubt you had time to see how I hid the letter I had just
received, under the paper-weight,"" said Nikolay Vsyevolodovitch calmly,
without moving from his place."
"""A letter?"
"Bless you and your letters, what are they to do with me?"""
cried the visitor.
"""But... what does matter..."" he whispered again,
turning to the door, which was by now closed, and nodding his head in
that direction."
"""She never listens,"" Nikolay Vsyevolodovitch observed coldly."
"""What if she did overhear?"""
"cried Pyotr Stepanovitch, raising his voice
cheerfully, and settling down in an arm-chair."
"""I've nothing against
that, only I've come here now to speak to you alone."
"Well, at last I've
succeeded in getting at you."
"First of all, how are you?"
"I see you're
getting on splendidly."
"To-morrow you'll show yourself again--eh?"""
"""Perhaps."""
"""Set their minds at rest."
"Set mine at rest at last."""
"He gesticulated
violently with a jocose and amiable air."
"""If only you knew what nonsense
I've had to talk to them."
"You know, though."""
He laughed.
"""I don't know everything."
"I only heard from my mother that you've
been... very active."""
"""Oh, well, I've said nothing definite,"" Pyotr Stepanovitch flared up
at once, as though defending himself from an awful attack."
"""I simply
trotted out Shatov's wife; you know, that is, the rumours of your
liaison in Paris, which accounted, of course, for what happened on
Sunday."
"You're not angry?"""
"""I'm sure you've done your best."""
"""Oh, that's just what I was afraid of."
"Though what does that mean, 'done
your best'?"
"That's a reproach, isn't it?"
"You always go straight for
things, though.... What I was most afraid of, as I came here, was that
you wouldn't go straight for the point."""
"""I don't want to go straight for anything,"" said Nikolay Vsyevolodovitch
with some irritation."
But he laughed at once.
"""I didn't mean that, I didn't mean that, don't make a mistake,"" cried
Pyotr Stepanovitch, waving his hands, rattling his words out like peas,
and at once relieved at his companion's irritability."
"""I'm not going to
worry you with _our_ business, especially in your present position."
"I've
only come about Sunday's affair, and only to arrange the most necessary
steps, because, you see, it's impossible."
"I've come with the frankest
explanations which I stand in more need of than you--so much for your
vanity, but at the same time it's true."
"I've come to be open with you
from this time forward."""
"""Then you have not been open with me before?"""
"""You know that yourself."
"I've been cunning with you many times... you
smile; I'm very glad of that smile as a prelude to our explanation."
"I
provoked that smile on purpose by using the word 'cunning,' so that you
might get cross directly at my daring to think I could be cunning, so
that I might have a chance of explaining myself at once."
"You see, you
see how open I have become now!"
"Well, do you care to listen?"""
"In the expression of Nikolay Vsyevolodovitch's face, which was
contemptuously composed, and even ironical, in spite of his visitor's
obvious desire to irritate him by the insolence of his premeditated
and intentionally coarse naïvetés, there was, at last, a look of rather
uneasy curiosity."
"""Listen,"" said Pyotr Stepanovitch, wriggling more than ever, ""when I set
off to come here, I mean here in the large sense, to this town, ten days
ago, I made up my mind, of course, to assume a character."
"It would
have been best to have done without anything, to have kept one's
own character, wouldn't it?"
"There is no better dodge than one's own
character, because no one believes in it."
"I meant, I must own, to assume
the part of a fool, because it is easier to be a fool than to act
one's own character; but as a fool is after all something extreme,
and anything extreme excites curiosity, I ended by sticking to my own
character."
And what is my own character?
"The golden mean: neither wise
nor foolish, rather stupid, and dropped from the moon, as sensible
people say here, isn't that it?"""
"""Perhaps it is,"" said Nikolay Vsyevolodovitch, with a faint smile."
"""Ah, you agree--I'm very glad; I knew beforehand that it was your own
opinion.... You needn't trouble, I am not annoyed, and I didn't describe
myself in that way to get a flattering contradiction from you--no,
you're not stupid, you're clever.... Ah!"
you're smiling again!...
"I've
blundered once more."
"You would not have said 'you're clever,' granted;
I'll let it pass anyway."
"_Passons,_ as papa says, and, in parenthesis,
don't be vexed with my verbosity."
"By the way, I always say a lot, that
is, use a great many words and talk very fast, and I never speak well."
"And why do I use so many words, and why do I never speak well?"
"Because
I don't know how to speak."
"People who can speak well, speak briefly."
"So
that I am stupid, am I not?"
"But as this gift of stupidity is natural
to me, why shouldn't I make skilful use of it?"
And I do make use of it.
"It's true that as I came here, I did think, at first, of being silent."
"But you know silence is a great talent, and therefore incongruous for
me, and secondly silence would be risky, anyway."
"So I made up my mind
finally that it would be best to talk, but to talk stupidly--that is, to
talk and talk and talk--to be in a tremendous hurry to explain things,
and in the end to get muddled in my own explanations, so that my
listener would walk away without hearing the end, with a shrug, or,
better still, with a curse."
"You succeed straight off in persuading them
of your simplicity, in boring them and in being incomprehensible--three
advantages all at once!"
"Do you suppose anybody will suspect you of
mysterious designs after that?"
"Why, every one of them would take it as
a personal affront if anyone were to say I had secret designs."
"And I
sometimes amuse them too, and that's priceless."
"Why, they're ready to
forgive me everything now, just because the clever fellow who used
to publish manifestoes out there turns out to be stupider than
themselves--that's so, isn't it?"
"From your smile I see you approve."""
"Nikolay Vsyevolodovitch was not smiling at all, however."
"On the contrary, he was listening with a frown and some impatience."
"""Eh?"
What?
"I believe you said 'no matter.'"""
Pyotr Stepanovitch rattled on.
"(Nikolay Vsyevolodovitch had said nothing
at all.)"
"""Of course, of course."
"I assure you I'm not here to compromise
you by my company, by claiming you as my comrade."
"But do you know you're
horribly captious to-day; I ran in to you with a light and open heart,
and you seem to be laying up every word I say against me."
"I assure you
I'm not going to begin about anything shocking to-day, I give you my
word, and I agree beforehand to all your conditions."""
Nikolay Vsyevolodovitch was obstinately silent.
"""Eh?"
What?
Did you say something?
"I see, I see that I've made a blunder
again, it seems; you've not suggested conditions and you're not going
to; I believe you, I believe you; well, you can set your mind at rest;
I know, of course, that it's not worth while for me to suggest them, is
it?"
"I'll answer for you beforehand, and--just from stupidity, of course;
stupidity again.... You're laughing?"
Eh?
"What?"""
"""Nothing,"" Nikolay Vsyevolodovitch laughed at last."
"""I just remembered
that I really did call you stupid, but you weren't there then, so they
must have repeated it...."
"I would ask you to make haste and come to the
point."""
"""Why, but I am at the point!"
"I am talking about Sunday,"" babbled Pyotr
Stepanovitch."
"""Why, what was I on Sunday?"
What would you call it?
"Just
fussy, mediocre stupidity, and in the stupidest way I took possession of
the conversation by force."
"But they forgave me everything, first because
I dropped from the moon, that seems to be settled here, now, by every
one; and, secondly, because I told them a pretty little story, and got
you all out of a scrape, didn't they, didn't they?"""
"""That is, you told your story so as to leave them in doubt and suggest
some compact and collusion between us, when there was no collusion and
I'd not asked you to do anything."""
"""Just so, just so!"""
"Pyotr Stepanovitch caught him up, apparently
delighted."
"""That's just what I did do, for I wanted you to see that I
implied it; I exerted myself chiefly for your sake, for I caught you and
wanted to compromise you, above all I wanted to find out how far you're
afraid."""
"""It would be interesting to know why you are so open now?"""
"""Don't be angry, don't be angry, don't glare at me.... You're not,
though."
You wonder why I am so open?
"Why, just because it's all changed
now; of course, it's over, buried under the sand."
"I've suddenly changed
my ideas about you."
"The old way is closed; now I shall never compromise
you in the old way, it will be in a new way now."""
"""You've changed your tactics?"""
"""There are no tactics."
"Now it's for you to decide in everything, that
is, if you want to, say yes, and if you want to, say no."
"There you have
my new tactics."
"And I won't say a word about our cause till you bid me
yourself."
You laugh?
Laugh away.
I'm laughing myself.
"But I'm in earnest
now, in earnest, in earnest, though a man who is in such a hurry is
stupid, isn't he?"
"Never mind, I may be stupid, but I'm in earnest, in
earnest."""
"He really was speaking in earnest in quite a different tone, and with a
peculiar excitement, so that Nikolay Vsyevolodovitch looked at him with
curiosity."
"""You say you've changed your ideas about me?"""
he asked.
"""I changed my ideas about you at the moment when you drew your hands
back after Shatov's attack, and, that's enough, that's enough, no
questions, please, I'll say nothing more now."""
"He jumped up, waving his hands as though waving off questions."
"But as
there were no questions, and he had no reason to go away, he sank into
an arm-chair again, somewhat reassured."
"""By the way, in parenthesis,"" he rattled on at once, ""some people here
are babbling that you'll kill him, and taking bets about it, so that
Lembke positively thought of setting the police on, but Yulia Mihailovna
forbade it...."
"But enough about that, quite enough, I only spoke of it
to let you know."
"By the way, I moved the Lebyadkins the same day, you
know; did you get my note with their address?"""
"""I received it at the time."""
"""I didn't do that by way of 'stupidity.'"
"I did it genuinely, to serve
you."
"If it was stupid, anyway, it was done in good faith."""
"""Oh, all right, perhaps it was necessary...."" said Nikolay
Vsyevolodovitch dreamily, ""only don't write any more letters to me, I
beg you."""
"""Impossible to avoid it."
"It was only one."""
"""So Liputin knows?"""
"""Impossible to help it: but Liputin, you know yourself, dare not... By
the way, you ought to meet our fellows, that is, _the_ fellows not _our_
fellows, or you'll be finding fault again."
"Don't disturb yourself,
not just now, but sometime."
Just now it's raining.
"I'll let them know,
they'll meet together, and we'll go in the evening."
"They're waiting,
with their mouths open like young crows in a nest, to see what present
we've brought them."
They're a hot-headed lot.
"They've brought out
leaflets, they're on the point of quarrelling."
"Virginsky is a universal
humanity man, Liputin is a Fourierist with a marked inclination for
police work; a man, I assure you, who is precious from one point of
view, though he requires strict supervision in all others; and, last of
all, that fellow with the long ears, he'll read an account of his own
system."
"And do you know, they're offended at my treating them casually,
and throwing cold water over them, but we certainly must meet."""
"""You've made me out some sort of chief?"""
"Nikolay Vsyevolodovitch dropped
as carelessly as possible."
Pyotr Stepanovitch looked quickly at him.
"""By the way,"" he interposed, in haste to change the subject, as though
he had not heard."
"""I've been here two or three times, you know, to see
her excellency, Varvara Petrovna, and I have been obliged to say a great
deal too."""
"""So I imagine."""
"""No, don't imagine, I've simply told her that you won't kill him, well,
and other sweet things."
"And only fancy; the very next day she knew I'd
moved Marya Timofyevna beyond the river."
"Was it you told her?"""
"""I never dreamed of it!"""
"""I knew it wasn't you."
Who else could it be?
"It's interesting."""
"""Liputin, of course."""
"""N-no, not Liputin,"" muttered Pyotr Stepanovitch, frowning; ""I'll find
out who."
It's more like Shatov.... That's nonsense though.
"Let's leave
that!"
"Though it's awfully important.... By the way, I kept expecting
that your mother would suddenly burst out with the great question....
Ach!"
"yes, she was horribly glum at first, but suddenly, when I came
to-day, she was beaming all over, what does that mean?"""
"""It's because I promised her to-day that within five days I'll be
engaged to Lizaveta Nikolaevna,"" Nikolay Vsyevolodovitch said with
surprising openness."
"""Oh!..."
"Yes, of course,"" faltered Pyotr Stepanovitch, seeming
disconcerted."
"""There are rumours of her engagement, you know."
"It's true,
too."
"But you're right, she'd run from under the wedding crown, you've
only to call to her."
"You're not angry at my saying so?"""
"""No, I'm not angry."""
"""I notice it's awfully hard to make you angry to-day, and I begin to be
afraid of you."
I'm awfully curious to know how you'll appear to-morrow.
I expect you've got a lot of things ready.
"You're not angry at my saying
so?"""
"Nikolay Vsyevolodovitch made no answer at all, which completed Pyotr
Stepanovitch's irritation."
"""By the way, did you say that in earnest to your mother, about Lizaveta
Nikolaevna?"""
he asked.
Nikolay Vsyevolodovitch looked coldly at him.
"""Oh, I understand, it was only to soothe her, of course."""
"""And if it were in earnest?"""
Nikolay Vsyevolodovitch asked firmly.
"""Oh, God bless you then, as they say in such cases."
"It won't hinder the
cause (you see, I don't say 'our,' you don't like the word 'our') and I
... well, I ... am at your service, as you know."""
"""You think so?"""
"""I think nothing--nothing,"" Pyotr Stepanovitch hurriedly declared,
laughing, ""because I know you consider what you're about beforehand for
yourself, and everything with you has been thought out."
"I only mean that
I am seriously at your service, always and everywhere, and in every sort
of circumstance, every sort really, do you understand that?"""
Nikolay Vsyevolodovitch yawned.
"""I've bored you,"" Pyotr Stepanovitch cried, jumping up suddenly, and
snatching his perfectly new round hat as though he were going away."
"He
remained and went on talking, however, though he stood up, sometimes
pacing about the room and tapping himself on the knee with his hat at
exciting parts of the conversation."
"""I meant to amuse you with stories of the Lembkes, too,"" he cried gaily."
"""Afterwards, perhaps, not now."
"But how is Yulia Mihailovna?"""
"""What conventional manners all of you have!"
"Her health is no more to
you than the health of the grey cat, yet you ask after it."
"I approve
of that."
"She's quite well, and her respect for you amounts to a
superstition, her immense anticipations of you amount to a superstition."
"She does not say a word about what happened on Sunday, and is convinced
that you will overcome everything yourself by merely making your
appearance."
Upon my word!
She fancies you can do anything.
"You're an
enigmatic and romantic figure now, more than ever you were--extremely
advantageous position."
"It is incredible how eager every one is to see
you."
"They were pretty hot when I went away, but now it is more so than
ever."
Thanks again for your letter.
"They are all afraid of Count K. Do
you know they look upon you as a spy?"
"I keep that up, you're not angry?"""
"""It does not matter."""
"""It does not matter; it's essential in the long run."
"They have their
ways of doing things here."
"I encourage it, of course; Yulia Mihailovna,
in the first place, Gaganov too.... You laugh?"
"But you know I have my
policy; I babble away and suddenly I say something clever just as they
are on the look-out for it."
They crowd round me and I humbug away again.
"They've all given me up in despair by now: 'he's got brains but he's
dropped from the moon.'"
"Lembke invites me to enter the service so that
I may be reformed."
"You know I treat him mockingly, that is, I compromise
him and he simply stares."
Yulia Mihailovna encourages it.
"Oh, by the
way, Gaganov is in an awful rage with you."
"He said the nastiest things
about you yesterday at Duhovo."
"I told him the whole truth on the spot,
that is, of course, not the whole truth."
"I spent the whole day at
Duhovo."
"It's a splendid estate, a fine house."""
"""Then is he at Duhovo now?"""
"Nikolay Vsyevolodovitch broke in suddenly,
making a sudden start forward and almost leaping up from his seat."
"""No, he drove me here this morning, we returned together,"" said Pyotr
Stepanovitch, appearing not to notice Stavrogin's momentary excitement."
"""What's this?"
"I dropped a book."""
"He bent down to pick up the ""keepsake""
he had knocked down."
"""'The Women of Balzac,' with illustrations."""
"He
opened it suddenly."
"""I haven't read it."
"Lembke writes novels too."""
"""Yes?"""
"queried Nikolay Vsyevolodovitch, as though beginning to be
interested."
"""In Russian, on the sly, of course, Yulia Mihailovna knows and allows
it."
"He's henpecked, but with good manners; it's their system."
"Such
strict form--such self-restraint!"
"Something of the sort would be the
thing for us."""
"""You approve of government methods?"""
"""I should rather think so!"
"It's the one thing that's natural and
practicable in Russia...."
I won't...
"I won't,"" he cried out suddenly,
""I'm not referring to that--not a word on delicate subjects."
"Good-bye,
though, you look rather green."""
"""I'm feverish."""
"""I can well believe it; you should go to bed."
"By the way, there are
Skoptsi here in the neighbourhood--they're curious people... of that
later, though."
"Ah, here's another anecdote."
"There's an infantry regiment
here in the district."
"I was drinking last Friday evening with the
officers."
"We've three friends among them, _vous comprenez?_ They were
discussing atheism and I need hardly say they made short work of God."
They were squealing with delight.
"By the way, Shatov declares that if
there's to be a rising in Russia we must begin with atheism."
"Maybe it's
true."
"One grizzled old stager of a captain sat mum, not saying a word."
"All at once he stands up in the middle of the room and says aloud, as
though speaking to himself: 'If there's no God, how can I be a captain
then?'"
"He took up his cap and went out, flinging up his hands."""
"""He expressed a rather sensible idea,"" said Nikolay Vsyevolodovitch,
yawning for the third time."
"""Yes?"
I didn't understand it; I meant to ask you about it.
"Well what
else have I to tell you?"
"The Shpigulin factory's interesting; as you
know, there are five hundred workmen in it, it's a hotbed of cholera,
it's not been cleaned for fifteen years and the factory hands are
swindled."
The owners are millionaires.
"I assure you that some among
the hands have an idea of the _Internationale._ What, you smile?"
"You'll
see--only give me ever so little time!"
"I've asked you to fix the time
already and now I ask you again and then...."
"But I beg your pardon,
I won't, I won't speak of that, don't frown."
"There!"""
"He turned back
suddenly."
"""I quite forgot the chief thing."
"I was told just now that our
box had come from Petersburg."""
"""You mean..."" Nikolay Vsyevolodovitch looked at him, not understanding."
"""Your box, your things, coats, trousers, and linen have come."
"Is it
true?"""
"""Yes... they said something about it this morning."""
"""Ach, then can't I open it at once!..."""
"""Ask Alexey."""
"""Well, to-morrow, then, will to-morrow do?"
"You see my new jacket,
dress-coat and three pairs of trousers are with your things, from
Sharmer's, by your recommendation, do you remember?"""
"""I hear you're going in for being a gentleman here,"" said Nikolay
Vsyevolodovitch with a smile."
"""Is it true you're going to take lessons
at the riding school?"""
Pyotr Stepanovitch smiled a wry smile.
"""I say,"" he said suddenly, with
excessive haste in a voice that quivered and faltered, ""I say, Nikolay
Vsyevolodovitch, let's drop personalities once for all."
"Of course, you
can despise me as much as you like if it amuses you--but we'd better
dispense with personalities for a time, hadn't we?"""
"""All right,"" Nikolay Vsyevolodovitch assented."
"Pyotr Stepanovitch grinned, tapped his knee with his hat, shifted from
one leg to the other, and recovered his former expression."
"""Some people here positively look upon me as your rival with Lizaveta
Nikolaevna, so I must think of my appearance, mustn't I,"" he laughed."
"""Who was it told you that though?"
H'm.
"It's just eight o'clock; well I
must be off."
"I promised to look in on Varvara Petrovna, but I shall
make my escape."
And you go to bed and you'll be stronger to-morrow.
"It's
raining and dark, but I've a cab, it's not over safe in the streets here
at night.... Ach, by the way, there's a run-away convict from Siberia,
Fedka, wandering about the town and the neighbourhood."
"Only fancy, he
used to be a serf of mine, and my papa sent him for a soldier fifteen
years ago and took the money for him."
"He's a very remarkable person."""
"""You have been talking to him?"""
Nikolay Vsyevolodovitch scanned him.
"""I have."
He lets me know where he is.
"He's ready for anything, anything,
for money of course, but he has convictions, too, of a sort, of course."
"Oh yes, by the way, again, if you meant anything of that plan, you
remember, about Lizaveta Nikolaevna, I tell you once again, I too am a
fellow ready for anything of any kind you like, and absolutely at
your service.... Hullo!"
are you reaching for your stick.
"Oh no... only
fancy..."
"I thought you were looking for your stick."""
Nikolay Vsyevolodovitch was looking for nothing and said nothing.
"But he had risen to his feet very suddenly with a strange look in his
face."
"""If you want any help about Mr. Gaganov either,"" Pyotr Stepanovitch
blurted out suddenly, this time looking straight at the paper-weight,
""of course I can arrange it all, and I'm certain you won't be able to
manage without me."""
"He went out suddenly without waiting for an answer, but thrust his
head in at the door once more."
"""I mention that,"" he gabbled hurriedly,
""because Shatov had no right either, you know, to risk his life last
Sunday when he attacked you, had he?"
"I should be glad if you would make
a note of that."""
He disappeared again without waiting for an answer.
"IV

Perhaps he imagined, as he made his exit, that as soon as he was left
alone, Nikolay Vsyevolodovitch would begin beating on the wall with his
fists, and no doubt he would have been glad to see this, if that
had been possible."
"But, if so, he was greatly mistaken."
"Nikolay
Vsyevolodovitch was still calm."
"He remained standing for two minutes in
the same position by the table, apparently plunged in thought, but soon
a cold and listless smile came on to his lips."
"He slowly sat down again
in the same place in the corner of the sofa, and shut his eyes as though
from weariness."
"The corner of the letter was still peeping from under
the paperweight, but he didn't even move to cover it."
He soon sank into complete forgetfulness.
"When Pyotr Stepanovitch went out without coming to see her, as he had
promised, Varvara Petrovna, who had been worn out by anxiety during
these days, could not control herself, and ventured to visit her son
herself, though it was not her regular time."
"She was still haunted by
the idea that he would tell her something conclusive."
"She knocked at
the door gently as before, and again receiving no answer, she opened
the door."
"Seeing that Nikolay Vsyevolodovitch was sitting strangely
motionless, she cautiously advanced to the sofa with a throbbing heart."
"She seemed struck by the fact that he could fall asleep so quickly and
that he could sleep sitting like that, so erect and motionless, so
that his breathing even was scarcely perceptible."
"His face was pale and
forbidding, but it looked, as it were, numb and rigid."
"His brows were
somewhat contracted and frowning."
"He positively had the look of a
lifeless wax figure."
"She stood over him for about three minutes,
almost holding her breath, and suddenly she was seized with terror."
"She
withdrew on tiptoe, stopped at the door, hurriedly made the sign of the
cross over him, and retreated unobserved, with a new oppression and a
new anguish at her heart."
"He slept a long while, more than an hour, and still in the same rigid
pose: not a muscle of his face twitched, there was not the faintest
movement in his whole body, and his brows were still contracted in the
same forbidding frown."
"If Varvara Petrovna had remained another three
minutes she could not have endured the stifling sensation that this
motionless lethargy roused in her, and would have waked him."
"But he
suddenly opened his eyes, and sat for ten minutes as immovable as
before, staring persistently and curiously, as though at some object
in the corner which had struck him, although there was nothing new or
striking in the room."
Suddenly there rang out the low deep note of the clock on the wall.
"With some uneasiness he turned to look at it, but almost at the same
moment the other door opened, and the butler, Alexey Yegorytch came in."
"He had in one hand a greatcoat, a scarf, and a hat, and in the other a
silver tray with a note on it."
"""Half-past nine,"" he announced softly, and laying the other things on a
chair, he held out the tray with the note--a scrap of paper unsealed and
scribbled in pencil."
"Glancing through it, Nikolay Vsyevolodovitch took
a pencil from the table, added a few words, and put the note back on the
tray."
"""Take it back as soon as I have gone out, and now dress me,"" he said,
getting up from the sofa."
"Noticing that he had on a light velvet jacket, he thought a minute,
and told the man to bring him a cloth coat, which he wore on more
ceremonious occasions."
"At last, when he was dressed and had put on his
hat, he locked the door by which his mother had come into the room, took
the letter from under the paperweight, and without saying a word went
out into the corridor, followed by Alexey Yegorytch."
"From the corridor
they went down the narrow stone steps of the back stairs to a passage
which opened straight into the garden."
"In the corner stood a lantern and
a big umbrella."
"""Owing to the excessive rain the mud in the streets is beyond anything,""
Alexey Yegorytch announced, making a final effort to deter his master
from the expedition."
"But opening his umbrella the latter went without
a word into the damp and sodden garden, which was dark as a cellar."
"The
wind was roaring and tossing the bare tree-tops."
"The little sandy
paths were wet and slippery."
"Alexey Yegorytch walked along as he was,
bareheaded, in his swallow-tail coat, lighting up the path for about
three steps before them with the lantern."
"""Won't it be noticed?"""
Nikolay Vsyevolodovitch asked suddenly.
"""Not from the windows."
"Besides I have seen to all that already,"" the old
servant answered in quiet and measured tones."
"""Has my mother retired?"""
"""Her excellency locked herself in at nine o'clock as she has done the
last few days, and there is no possibility of her knowing anything."
"At
what hour am I to expect your honour?"""
"""At one or half-past, not later than two."""
"""Yes, sir."""
"Crossing the garden by the winding paths that they both knew by heart,
they reached the stone wall, and there in the farthest corner found
a little door, which led out into a narrow and deserted lane, and was
always kept locked."
"It appeared that Alexey Yegorytch had the key in his
hand."
"""Won't the door creak?"""
Nikolay Vsyevolodovitch inquired again.
"But Alexey Yegorytch informed him that it had been oiled yesterday ""as
well as to-day."""
He was by now wet through.
"Unlocking the door he gave
the key to Nikolay Vsyevolodovitch."
"""If it should be your pleasure to be taking a distant walk, I would warn
your honour that I am not confident of the folk here, especially in
the back lanes, and especially beyond the river,"" he could not resist
warning him again."
"He was an old servant, who had been like a nurse to
Nikolay Vsyevolodovitch, and at one time used to dandle him in his arms;
he was a grave and severe man who was fond of listening to religious
discourse and reading books of devotion."
"""Don't be uneasy, Alexey Yegorytch."""
"""May God's blessing rest on you, sir, but only in your righteous
undertakings."""
"""What?"""
"said Nikolay Vsyevolodovitch, stopping short in the lane."
Alexey Yegorytch resolutely repeated his words.
"He had never before
ventured to express himself in such language in his master's presence."
"Nikolay Vsyevolodovitch locked the door, put the key in his pocket, and
crossed the lane, sinking five or six inches into the mud at every step."
He came out at last into a long deserted street.
"He knew the town like
the five fingers of his hand, but Bogoyavlensky Street was a long way
off."
"It was past ten when he stopped at last before the locked gates of
the dark old house that belonged to Filipov."
"The ground floor had stood
empty since the Lebyadkins had left it, and the windows were boarded up,
but there was a light burning in Shatov's room on the second floor."
"As
there was no bell he began banging on the gate with his hand."
"A window
was opened and Shatov peeped out into the street."
"It was terribly dark,
and difficult to make out anything."
"Shatov was peering out for some
time, about a minute."
"""Is that you?"""
he asked suddenly.
"""Yes,"" replied the uninvited guest."
"Shatov slammed the window, went downstairs and opened the gate."
"Nikolay
Vsyevolodovitch stepped over the high sill, and without a word passed by
him straight into Kirillov's lodge."
"V

There everything was unlocked and all the doors stood open."
"The passage
and the first two rooms were dark, but there was a light shining in the
last, in which Kirillov lived and drank tea, and laughter and strange
cries came from it."
"Nikolay Vsyevolodovitch went towards the light, but
stood still in the doorway without going in."
There was tea on the table.
"In the middle of the room stood the old woman who was a relation of the
landlord."
"She was bareheaded and was dressed in a petticoat and a
hare-skin jacket, and her stockingless feet were thrust into slippers."
"In her arms she had an eighteen-months-old baby, with nothing on but its
little shirt; with bare legs, flushed cheeks, and ruffled white hair."
"It
had only just been taken out of the cradle."
"It seemed to have just been
crying; there were still tears in its eyes."
"But at that instant it was
stretching out its little arms, clapping its hands, and laughing with a
sob as little children do."
"Kirillov was bouncing a big red india-rubber
ball on the floor before it."
"The ball bounced up to the ceiling, and back
to the floor, the baby shrieked ""Baw!"
"baw!"""
"Kirillov caught the ""baw"",
and gave it to it."
"The baby threw it itself with its awkward little hands,
and Kirillov ran to pick it up again."
"At last the ""baw"" rolled under the cupboard."
"""Baw!"
"baw!"""
"cried the
child."
"Kirillov lay down on the floor, trying to reach the ball with his
hand under the cupboard."
Nikolay Vsyevolodovitch went into the room.
"The
baby caught sight of him, nestled against the old woman, and went off
into a prolonged infantile wail."
"The woman immediately carried it out of
the room."
"""Stavrogin?"""
"said Kirillov, beginning to get up from the floor with the
ball in his hand, and showing no surprise at the unexpected visit."
"""Will
you have tea?"""
He rose to his feet.
"""I should be very glad of it, if it's hot,"" said Nikolay
Vsyevolodovitch; ""I'm wet through."""
"""It's hot, nearly boiling in fact,"" Kirillov declared delighted."
"""Sit
down."
"You're muddy, but that's nothing; I'll mop up the floor later."""
"Nikolay Vsyevolodovitch sat down and emptied the cup he handed him
almost at a gulp."
"""Some more?"""
asked Kirillov.
"""No, thank you."""
"Kirillov, who had not sat down till then, seated himself facing him, and
inquired:

""Why have you come?"""
"""On business."
"Here, read this letter from Gaganov; do you remember, I
talked to you about him in Petersburg."""
"Kirillov took the letter, read it, laid it on the table and looked at
him expectantly."
"""As you know, I met this Gaganov for the first time in my life a month
ago, in Petersburg,"" Nikolay Vsyevolodovitch began to explain."
"""We
came across each other two or three times in company with other people."
"Without making my acquaintance and without addressing me, he managed to
be very insolent to me."
"I told you so at the time; but now for something
you don't know."
"As he was leaving Petersburg before I did, he sent me
a letter, not like this one, yet impertinent in the highest degree, and
what was queer about it was that it contained no sort of explanation of
why it was written."
"I answered him at once, also by letter, and said,
quite frankly, that he was probably angry with me on account of the
incident with his father four years ago in the club here, and that I for
my part was prepared to make him every possible apology, seeing that my
action was unintentional and was the result of illness."
"I begged him to
consider and accept my apologies."
"He went away without answering, and
now here I find him in a regular fury."
"Several things he has said about
me in public have been repeated to me, absolutely abusive, and making
astounding charges against me."
"Finally, to-day, I get this letter, a
letter such as no one has ever had before, I should think, containing
such expressions as 'the punch you got in your ugly face.'"
"I came in the
hope that you would not refuse to be my second."""
"""You said no one has ever had such a letter,"" observed Kirillov, ""they
may be sent in a rage."
Such letters have been written more than once.
Pushkin wrote to Hekern.
"All right, I'll come."
"Tell me how."""
"Nikolay Vsyevolodovitch explained that he wanted it to be to-morrow, and
that he must begin by renewing his offers of apology, and even with the
promise of another letter of apology, but on condition that Gaganov,
on his side, should promise to send no more letters."
"The letter he had
received he would regard as unwritten."
"""Too much concession; he won't agree,"" said Kirillov."
"""I've come first of all to find out whether you would consent to be the
bearer of such terms."""
"""I'll take them."
It's your affair.
"But he won't agree."""
"""I know he won't agree."""
"""He wants to fight."
"Say how you'll fight."""
"""The point is that I want the thing settled to-morrow."
"By nine o'clock
in the morning you must be at his house."
"He'll listen, and won't agree,
but will put you in communication with his second--let us say about
eleven."
"You will arrange things with him, and let us all be on the
spot by one or two o'clock."
Please try to arrange that.
"The weapons, of
course, will be pistols."
"And I particularly beg you to arrange to fix
the barriers at ten paces apart; then you put each of us ten paces from
the barrier, and at a given signal we approach."
"Each must go right up to
his barrier, but you may fire before, on the way."
"I believe that's all."""
"""Ten paces between the barriers is very near,"" observed Kirillov."
"""Well, twelve then, but not more."
"You understand that he wants to fight
in earnest."
"Do you know how to load a pistol?"""
"""I do."
I've got pistols.
"I'll give my word that you've never fired
them."
His second will give his word about his.
"There'll be two pairs of
pistols, and we'll toss up, his or ours?"""
"""Excellent."""
"""Would you like to look at the pistols?"""
"""Very well."""
"Kirillov squatted on his heels before the trunk in the corner, which
he had never yet unpacked, though things had been pulled out of it as
required."
"He pulled out from the bottom a palm-wood box lined with red
velvet, and from it took out a pair of smart and very expensive pistols."
"""I've got everything, powder, bullets, cartridges."
"I've a revolver
besides, wait."""
"He stooped down to the trunk again and took out a six-chambered American
revolver."
"""You've got weapons enough, and very good ones."""
"""Very, extremely."""
"Kirillov, who was poor, almost destitute, though he never noticed his
poverty, was evidently proud of showing precious weapons, which he had
certainly obtained with great sacrifice."
"""You still have the same intentions?"""
"Stavrogin asked after a moment's
silence, and with a certain wariness."
"""Yes,"" answered Kirillov shortly, guessing at once from his voice what
he was asking about, and he began taking the weapons from the table."
"""When?"""
"Nikolay Vsyevolodovitch inquired still more cautiously, after a
pause."
"In the meantime Kirillov had put both the boxes back in his trunk, and
sat down in his place again."
"""That doesn't depend on me, as you know--when they tell me,"" he
muttered, as though disliking the question; but at the same time with
evident readiness to answer any other question."
"He kept his black,
lustreless eyes fixed continually on Stavrogin with a calm but warm and
kindly expression in them."
"""I understand shooting oneself, of course,"" Nikolay Vsyevolodovitch
began suddenly, frowning a little, after a dreamy silence that lasted
three minutes."
"""I sometimes have thought of it myself, and then there
always came a new idea: if one did something wicked, or, worse still,
something shameful, that is, disgraceful, only very shameful and...
ridiculous, such as people would remember for a thousand years and hold
in scorn for a thousand years, and suddenly the thought comes: 'one blow
in the temple and there would be nothing more.'"
"One wouldn't care then
for men and that they would hold one in scorn for a thousand years,
would one?"""
"""You call that a new idea?"""
"said Kirillov, after a moment's thought."
"""I... didn't call it so, but when I thought it I felt it as a new idea."""
"""You 'felt the idea'?"""
observed Kirillov.
"""That's good."
"There are lots
of ideas that are always there and yet suddenly become new."
That's true.
"I see a great deal now as though it were for the first time."""
"""Suppose you had lived in the moon,"" Stavrogin interrupted, not
listening, but pursuing his own thought, ""and suppose there you had done
all these nasty and ridiculous things.... You know from here for certain
that they will laugh at you and hold you in scorn for a thousand years
as long as the moon lasts."
"But now you are here, and looking at the moon
from here."
"You don't care here for anything you've done there, and that
the people there will hold you in scorn for a thousand years, do you?"""
"""I don't know,"" answered Kirillov."
"""I've not been in the moon,"" he
added, without any irony, simply to state the fact."
"""Whose baby was that just now?"""
"""The old woman's mother-in-law was here--no, daughter-in-law, it's all
the same."
Three days.
"She's lying ill with the baby, it cries a lot at
night, it's the stomach."
"The mother sleeps, but the old woman picks it
up; I play ball with it."
The ball's from Hamburg.
"I bought it in Hamburg
to throw it and catch it, it strengthens the spine."
"It's a girl."""
"""Are you fond of children?"""
"""I am,"" answered Kirillov, though rather indifferently."
"""Then you're fond of life?"""
"""Yes, I'm fond of life!"
"What of it?"""
"""Though you've made up your mind to shoot yourself."""
"""What of it?"
Why connect it?
Life's one thing and that's another.
"Life
exists, but death doesn't at all."""
"""You've begun to believe in a future eternal life?"""
"""No, not in a future eternal life, but in eternal life here."
"There are
moments, you reach moments, and time suddenly stands still, and it will
become eternal."""
"""You hope to reach such a moment?"""
"""Yes."""
"""That'll scarcely be possible in our time,"" Nikolay Vsyevolodovitch
responded slowly and, as it were, dreamily; the two spoke without the
slightest irony."
"""In the Apocalypse the angel swears that there will be
no more time."""
"""I know."
That's very true; distinct and exact.
"When all mankind attains
happiness then there will be no more time, for there'll be no need of
it, a very true thought."""
"""Where will they put it?"""
"""Nowhere."
Time's not an object but an idea.
"It will be extinguished in
the mind."""
"""The old commonplaces of philosophy, the same from the beginning of
time,"" Stavrogin muttered with a kind of disdainful compassion."
"""Always the same, always the same, from the beginning of time and never
any other,"" Kirillov said with sparkling eyes, as though there were
almost a triumph in that idea."
"""You seem to be very happy, Kirillov."""
"""Yes, very happy,"" he answered, as though making the most ordinary
reply."
"""But you were distressed so lately, angry with Liputin."""
"""H'm..."
I'm not scolding now.
I didn't know then that I was happy.
"Have
you seen a leaf, a leaf from a tree?"""
"""Yes."""
"""I saw a yellow one lately, a little green."
It was decayed at the edges.
It was blown by the wind.
"When I was ten years old I used to shut my
eyes in the winter on purpose and fancy a green leaf, bright, with veins
on it, and the sun shining."
"I used to open my eyes and not believe them,
because it was very nice, and I used to shut them again."""
"""What's that?"
"An allegory?"""
"""N-no... why?"
"I'm not speaking of an allegory, but of a leaf, only a
leaf."
The leaf is good.
"Everything's good."""
"""Everything?"""
"""Everything."
Man is unhappy because he doesn't know he's happy.
"It's
only that."
"That's all, that's all!"
"If anyone finds out he'll become
happy at once, that minute."
"That mother-in-law will die; but the baby
will remain."
It's all good.
"I discovered it all of a sudden."""
"""And if anyone dies of hunger, and if anyone insults and outrages the
little girl, is that good?"""
"""Yes!"
"And if anyone blows his brains out for the baby, that's good too."
"And if anyone doesn't, that's good too."
"It's all good, all."
"It's good
for all those who know that it's all good."
"If they knew that it was good
for them, it would be good for them, but as long as they don't know it's
good for them, it will be bad for them."
"That's the whole idea, the whole
of it."""
"""When did you find out you were so happy?"""
"""Last week, on Tuesday, no, Wednesday, for it was Wednesday by that
time, in the night."""
"""By what reasoning?"""
"""I don't remember; I was walking about the room; never mind."
"I stopped
my clock."
"It was thirty-seven minutes past two."""
"""As an emblem of the fact that there will be no more time?"""
Kirillov was silent.
"""They're bad because they don't know they're good."
"When they find out,
they won't outrage a little girl."
"They'll find out that they're good and
they'll all become good, every one of them."""
"""Here you've found it out, so have you become good then?"""
"""I am good."""
"""That I agree with, though,"" Stavrogin muttered, frowning."
"""He who teaches that all are good will end the world."""
"""He who taught it was crucified."""
"""He will come, and his name will be the man-god."""
"""The god-man?"""
"""The man-god."
"That's the difference."""
"""Surely it wasn't you lighted the lamp under the ikon?"""
"""Yes, it was I lighted it."""
"""Did you do it believing?"""
"""The old woman likes to have the lamp and she hadn't time to do it
to-day,"" muttered Kirillov."
"""You don't say prayers yourself?"""
"""I pray to everything."
"You see the spider crawling on the wall, I look
at it and thank it for crawling."""
His eyes glowed again.
"He kept looking straight at Stavrogin with
firm and unflinching expression."
"Stavrogin frowned and watched him
disdainfully, but there was no mockery in his eyes."
"""I'll bet that when I come next time you'll be believing in God too,""
he said, getting up and taking his hat."
"""Why?"""
"said Kirillov, getting up too."
"""If you were to find out that you believe in God, then you'd believe in
Him; but since you don't know that you believe in Him, then you don't
believe in Him,"" laughed Nikolay Vsyevolodovitch."
"""That's not right,"" Kirillov pondered, ""you've distorted the idea."
"It's
a flippant joke."
"Remember what you have meant in my life, Stavrogin."""
"""Good-bye, Kirillov."""
"""Come at night; when will you?"""
"""Why, haven't you forgotten about to-morrow?"""
"""Ach, I'd forgotten."
Don't be uneasy.
I won't oversleep.
"At nine
o'clock."
I know how to wake up when I want to.
"I go to bed saying 'seven
o'clock,' and I wake up at seven o'clock, 'ten o'clock,' and I wake up
at ten o'clock."""
"""You have remarkable powers,"" said Nikolay Vsyevolodovitch, looking at
his pale face."
"""I'll come and open the gate."""
"""Don't trouble, Shatov will open it for me."""
"""Ah, Shatov."
"Very well, good-bye."""
"VI

The door of the empty house in which Shatov was lodging was not closed;
but, making his way into the passage, Stavrogin found himself in utter
darkness, and began feeling with his hand for the stairs to the upper
story."
Suddenly a door opened upstairs and a light appeared.
"Shatov
did not come out himself, but simply opened his door."
"When Nikolay
Vsyevolodovitch was standing in the doorway of the room, he saw Shatov
standing at the table in the corner, waiting expectantly."
"""Will you receive me on business?"""
he queried from the doorway.
"""Come in and sit down,"" answered Shatov."
"""Shut the door; stay, I'll shut
it."""
"He locked the door, returned to the table, and sat down, facing Nikolay
Vsyevolodovitch."
"He had grown thinner during that week, and now he
seemed in a fever."
"""You've been worrying me to death,"" he said, looking down, in a soft
half-whisper."
"""Why didn't you come?"""
"""You were so sure I should come then?"""
"""Yes, stay, I have been delirious... perhaps I'm delirious now.... Stay
a moment."""
"He got up and seized something that was lying on the uppermost of his
three bookshelves."
It was a revolver.
"""One night, in delirium, I fancied that you were coming to kill me, and
early next morning I spent my last farthing on buying a revolver from
that good-for-nothing fellow Lyamshin; I did not mean to let you do it."
Then I came to myself again...
"I've neither powder nor shot; it has been
lying there on the shelf till now; wait a minute....""

He got up and was opening the casement."
"""Don't throw it away, why should you?"""
"Nikolay Vsyevolodovitch checked
him."
"""It's worth something."
"Besides, tomorrow people will begin saying
that there are revolvers lying about under Shatov's window."
"Put it back,
that's right; sit down."
"Tell me, why do you seem to be penitent for
having thought I should come to kill you?"
"I have not come now to be
reconciled, but to talk of something necessary."
"Enlighten me to begin
with."
"You didn't give me that blow because of my connection with your
wife?"""
"""You know I didn't, yourself,"" said Shatov, looking down again."
"""And not because you believed the stupid gossip about Darya Pavlovna?"""
"""No, no, of course not!"
It's nonsense!
"My sister told me from the very
first..."" Shatov said, harshly and impatiently, and even with a slight
stamp of his foot."
"""Then I guessed right and you too guessed right,"" Nikolay
Vsyevolodovitch went on in a tranquil voice."
"""You are right."
"Marya
Timofyevna Lebyadkin is my lawful wife, married to me four and a half
years ago in Petersburg."
"I suppose the blow was on her account?"""
"Shatov, utterly astounded, listened in silence."
"""I guessed, but did not believe it,"" he muttered at last, looking
strangely at Stavrogin."
"""And you struck me?"""
"Shatov flushed and muttered almost incoherently:

""Because of your fall... your lie."
"I didn't go up to you to punish
you..."
I didn't know when I went up to you that I should strike you...
"I
did it because you meant so much to me in my life..."
"I...""

""I understand, I understand, spare your words."
"I am sorry you are
feverish."
"I've come about a most urgent matter."""
"""I have been expecting you too long."""
"Shatov seemed to be quivering all
over, and he got up from his seat."
"""Say what you have to say..."
"I'll
speak too..."
"later."""
He sat down.
"""What I have come about is nothing of that kind,"" began Nikolay
Vsyevolodovitch, scrutinising him with curiosity."
"""Owing to certain
circumstances I was forced this very day to choose such an hour to come
and tell you that they may murder you."""
Shatov looked wildly at him.
"""I know that I may be in some danger,"" he said in measured tones, ""but
how can you have come to know of it?"""
"""Because I belong to them as you do, and am a member of their society,
just as you are."""
"""You... you are a member of the society?"""
"""I see from your eyes that you were prepared for anything from me rather
than that,"" said Nikolay Vsyevolodovitch, with a faint smile."
"""But,
excuse me, you knew then that there would be an attempt on your life?"""
"""Nothing of the sort."
"And I don't think so now, in spite of your words,
though... though there's no being sure of anything with these fools!"""
"he cried suddenly in a fury, striking the table with his fist."
"""I'm not
afraid of them!"
I've broken with them.
"That fellow's run here four times
to tell me it was possible... but""--he looked at Stavrogin--""what do
you know about it, exactly?"""
"""Don't be uneasy; I am not deceiving you,"" Nikolay Vsyevolodovitch went
on, rather coldly, with the air of a man who is only fulfilling a duty."
"""You question me as to what I know."
"I know that you entered that society
abroad, two years ago, at the time of the old organisation, just before
you went to America, and I believe, just after our last conversation,
about which you wrote so much to me in your letter from America."
"By
the way, I must apologise for not having answered you by letter, but
confined myself to...""

""To sending the money; wait a bit,"" Shatov interrupted, hurriedly
pulling out a drawer in the table and taking from under some papers a
rainbow-coloured note."
"""Here, take it, the hundred roubles you sent me;
but for you I should have perished out there."
"I should have been a long
time paying it back if it had not been for your mother."
"She made me a
present of that note nine months ago, because I was so badly off after
my illness."
"But, go on, please....""

He was breathless."
"""In America you changed your views, and when you came back you wanted to
resign."
"They gave you no answer, but charged you to take over a printing
press here in Russia from someone, and to keep it till you handed
it over to someone who would come from them for it."
"I don't know
the details exactly, but I fancy that's the position in outline."
"You
undertook it in the hope, or on the condition, that it would be the last
task they would require of you, and that then they would release you
altogether."
"Whether that is so or not, I learnt it, not from them, but
quite by chance."
"But now for what I fancy you don't know; these gentry
have no intention of parting with you."""
"""That's absurd!"""
cried Shatov.
"""I've told them honestly that I've cut
myself off from them in everything."
"That is my right, the right to
freedom of conscience and of thought...."
I won't put up with it!
"There's
no power which could...""

""I say, don't shout,"" Nikolay Vsyevolodovitch said earnestly, checking
him."
"""That Verhovensky is such a fellow that he may be listening to us
now in your passage, perhaps, with his own ears or someone else's."
"Even
that drunkard, Lebyadkin, was probably bound to keep an eye on you,
and you on him, too, I dare say?"
"You'd better tell me, has Verhovensky
accepted your arguments now, or not?"""
"""He has."
"He has said that it can be done and that I have the right....""

""Well then, he's deceiving you."
"I know that even Kirillov, who scarcely
belongs to them at all, has given them information about you."
"And they
have lots of agents, even people who don't know that they're serving
the society."
They've always kept a watch on you.
"One of the things Pyotr
Verhovensky came here for was to settle your business once for all, and
he is fully authorised to do so, that is at the first good opportunity,
to get rid of you, as a man who knows too much and might give them away."
"I repeat that this is certain, and allow me to add that they are, for
some reason, convinced that you are a spy, and that if you haven't
informed against them yet, you will."
"Is that true?"""
"Shatov made a wry face at hearing such a question asked in such a
matter-of fact tone."
"""If I were a spy, whom could I inform?"""
"he said angrily, not giving a
direct answer."
"""No, leave me alone, let me go to the devil!"""
"he cried
suddenly, catching again at his original idea, which agitated him
violently."
"Apparently it affected him more deeply than the news of his
own danger."
"""You, you, Stavrogin, how could you mix yourself up with
such shameful, stupid, second-hand absurdity?"
"You a member of the
society?"
"What an exploit for Stavrogin!"""
"he cried suddenly, in despair."
"He clasped his hands, as though nothing could be a bitterer and more
inconsolable grief to him than such a discovery."
"""Excuse me,"" said Nikolay Vsyevolodovitch, extremely surprised, ""but you
seem to look upon me as a sort of sun, and on yourself as an insect in
comparison."
"I noticed that even from your letter in America."""
"""You... you know.... Oh, let us drop me altogether,"" Shatov broke off
suddenly, ""and if you can explain anything about yourself explain it....
Answer my question!"""
he repeated feverishly.
"""With pleasure."
You ask how I could get into such a den?
"After what
I have told you, I'm bound to be frank with you to some extent on the
subject."
"You see, strictly speaking, I don't belong to the society at
all, and I never have belonged to it, and I've much more right than
you to leave them, because I never joined them."
"In fact, from the very
beginning I told them that I was not one of them, and that if I've
happened to help them it has simply been by accident as a man of
leisure."
"I took some part in reorganising the society, on the new plan,
but that was all."
"But now they've changed their views, and have made up
their minds that it would be dangerous to let me go, and I believe I'm
sentenced to death too."""
"""Oh, they do nothing but sentence to death, and all by means of sealed
documents, signed by three men and a half."
"And you think they've any
power!"""
"""You're partly right there and partly not,"" Stavrogin answered with the
same indifference, almost listlessness."
"""There's no doubt that there's a
great deal that's fanciful about it, as there always is in such cases: a
handful magnifies its size and significance."
"To my thinking, if you will
have it, the only one is Pyotr Verhovensky, and it's simply good-nature
on his part to consider himself only an agent of the society."
"But
the fundamental idea is no stupider than others of the sort."
"They are
connected with the _Internationale._ They have succeeded in establishing
agents in Russia, they have even hit on a rather original method, though
it's only theoretical, of course."
"As for their intentions here, the
movements of our Russian organisation are something so obscure and
almost always unexpected that really they might try anything among us."
"Note that Verhovensky is an obstinate man."""
"""He's a bug, an ignoramus, a buffoon, who understands nothing in
Russia!"""
cried Shatov spitefully.
"""You know him very little."
"It's quite true that none of them understand
much about Russia, but not much less than you and I do."
"Besides,
Verhovensky is an enthusiast."""
"""Verhovensky an enthusiast?"""
"""Oh, yes."
"There is a point when he ceases to be a buffoon and becomes
a madman."
"I beg you to remember your own expression: 'Do you know how
powerful a single man may be?'"
"Please don't laugh about it, he's quite
capable of pulling a trigger."
They are convinced that I am a spy too.
"As they don't know how to do things themselves, they're awfully fond of
accusing people of being spies."""
"""But you're not afraid, are you?"""
"""N--no."
I'm not very much afraid....
But your case is quite different.
"I
warned you that you might anyway keep it in mind."
"To my thinking there's
no reason to be offended in being threatened with danger by fools; their
brains don't affect the question."
"They've raised their hand against
better men than you or me."
"It's a quarter past eleven, though."""
"He
looked at his watch and got up from his chair."
"""I wanted to ask you one
quite irrelevant question."""
"""For God's sake!"""
"cried Shatov, rising impulsively from his seat."
"""I beg your pardon?"""
Nikolay Vsyevolodovitch looked at him inquiringly.
"""Ask it, ask your question for God's sake,"" Shatov repeated in
indescribable excitement, ""but on condition that I ask you a question
too."
I beseech you to allow me...
"I can't... ask your question!"""
Stavrogin waited a moment and then began.
"""I've heard that you have some
influence on Marya Timofyevna, and that she was fond of seeing you and
hearing you talk."
"Is that so?"""
"""Yes... she used to listen..."" said Shatov, confused."
"""Within a day or two I intend to make a public announcement of our
marriage here in the town."""
"""Is that possible?"""
"Shatov whispered, almost with horror."
"""I don't quite understand you."
"There's no sort of difficulty about it,
witnesses to the marriage are here."
"Everything took place in Petersburg,
perfectly legally and smoothly, and if it has not been made known till
now, it is simply because the witnesses, Kirillov, Pyotr Verhovensky,
and Lebyadkin (whom I now have the pleasure of claiming as a
brother-in-law) promised to hold their tongues."""
"""I don't mean that... You speak so calmly... but good!"
Listen!
"You
weren't forced into that marriage, were you?"""
"""No, no one forced me into it."""
"Nikolay Vsyevolodovitch smiled at
Shatov's importunate haste."
"""And what's that talk she keeps up about her baby?"""
"Shatov interposed
disconnectedly, with feverish haste."
"""She talks about her baby?"
Bah!
I didn't know.
"It's the first time
I've heard of it."
"She never had a baby and couldn't have had: Marya
Timofyevna is a virgin."""
"""Ah!"
That's just what I thought!
"Listen!"""
"""What's the matter with you, Shatov?"""
"Shatov hid his face in his hands, turned away, but suddenly clutched
Stavrogin by the shoulders."
"""Do you know why, do you know why, anyway,"" he shouted, ""why you did all
this, and why you are resolved on such a punishment now!"""
"""Your question is clever and malignant, but I mean to surprise you too;
I fancy I do know why I got married then, and why I am resolved on such
a punishment now, as you express it."""
"""Let's leave that... of that later."
Put it off.
"Let's talk of the chief
thing, the chief thing."
"I've been waiting two years for you."""
"""Yes?"""
"""I've waited too long for you."
I've been thinking of you incessantly.
You are the only man who could move...
"I wrote to you about it from
America."""
"""I remember your long letter very well."""
"""Too long to be read?"
No doubt; six sheets of notepaper.
Don't speak!
Don't speak!
"Tell me, can you spare me another ten minutes?..."
"But now,
this minute..."
"I have waited for you too long."""
"""Certainly, half an hour if you like, but not more, if that will suit
you."""
"""And on condition, too,"" Shatov put in wrathfully, ""that you take a
different tone."
Do you hear?
I demand when I ought to entreat.
"Do you
understand what it means to demand when one ought to entreat?"""
"""I understand that in that way you lift yourself above all
ordinary considerations for the sake of loftier aims,"" said Nikolay
Vsyevolodovitch with a faint smile."
"""I see with regret, too, that you're
feverish."""
"""I beg you to treat me with respect, I insist on it!"""
"shouted Shatov,
""not my personality--I don't care a hang for that, but something else,
just for this once."
"While I am talking... we are two beings, and have
come together in infinity... for the last time in the world."
"Drop your
tone, and speak like a human being!"
"Speak, if only for once in your life
with the voice of a man."
I say it not for my sake but for yours.
"Do you
understand that you ought to forgive me that blow in the face if only
because I gave you the opportunity of realising your immense power."
"... Again you smile your disdainful, worldly smile!"
"Oh, when will you
understand me!"
Have done with being a snob!
"Understand that I insist
on that."
"I insist on it, else I won't speak, I'm not going to for
anything!"""
His excitement was approaching frenzy.
"Nikolay Vsyevolodovitch frowned
and seemed to become more on his guard."
"""Since I have remained another half-hour with you when time is so
precious,"" he pronounced earnestly and impressively, ""you may rest
assured that I mean to listen to you at least with interest... and I am
convinced that I shall hear from you much that is new."""
He sat down on a chair.
"""Sit down!"""
"cried Shatov, and he sat down himself."
"""Please remember,"" Stavrogin interposed once more, ""that I was about
to ask a real favour of you concerning Marya Timofyevna, of great
importance for her, anyway....""

""What?"""
"Shatov frowned suddenly with the air of a man who has just been
interrupted at the most important moment, and who gazes at you unable to
grasp the question."
"""And you did not let me finish,"" Nikolay Vsyevolodovitch went on with a
smile."
"""Oh, nonsense, afterwards!"""
"Shatov waved his hand disdainfully,
grasping, at last, what he wanted, and passed at once to his principal
theme."
"VII

""Do you know,"" he began, with flashing eyes, almost menacingly, bending
right forward in his chair, raising the forefinger of his right hand
above him (obviously unaware that he was doing so), ""do you know who are
the only 'god-bearing' people on earth, destined to regenerate and save
the world in the name of a new God, and to whom are given the keys of
life and of the new world... Do you know which is that people and what
is its name?"""
"""From your manner I am forced to conclude, and I think I may as well do
so at once, that it is the Russian people."""
"""And you can laugh, oh, what a race!"""
Shatov burst out.
"""Calm yourself, I beg of you; on the contrary, I was expecting something
of the sort from you."""
"""You expected something of the sort?"
"And don't you know those words
yourself?"""
"""I know them very well."
I see only too well what you're driving at.
"All
your phrases, even the expression 'god-bearing people' is only a sequel
to our talk two years ago, abroad, not long before you went to America."
"... At least, as far as I can recall it now."""
"""It's your phrase altogether, not mine."
"Your own, not simply the sequel
of our conversation."
'Our' conversation it was not at all.
"It was a
teacher uttering weighty words, and a pupil who was raised from the
dead."
"I was that pupil and you were the teacher."""
"""But, if you remember, it was just after my words you joined their
society, and only afterwards went away to America."""
"""Yes, and I wrote to you from America about that."
"I wrote to you about
everything."
"Yes, I could not at once tear my bleeding heart from what
I had grown into from childhood, on which had been lavished all the
raptures of my hopes and all the tears of my hatred...."
"It is difficult
to change gods."
"I did not believe you then, because I did not want to
believe, I plunged for the last time into that sewer...."
"But the seed
remained and grew up."
"Seriously, tell me seriously, didn't you read all
my letter from America, perhaps you didn't read it at all?"""
"""I read three pages of it."
The two first and the last.
"And I glanced
through the middle as well."
"But I was always meaning...""

""Ah, never mind, drop it!"
"Damn it!"""
"cried Shatov, waving his hand."
"""If
you've renounced those words about the people now, how could you have
uttered them then?..."
"That's what crushes me now."""
"""I wasn't joking with you then; in persuading you I was perhaps
more concerned with myself than with you,"" Stavrogin pronounced
enigmatically."
"""You weren't joking!"
"In America I was lying for three months on straw
beside a hapless creature, and I learnt from him that at the very time
when you were sowing the seed of God and the Fatherland in my heart, at
that very time, perhaps during those very days, you were infecting the
heart of that hapless creature, that maniac Kirillov, with poison... you
confirmed false malignant ideas in him, and brought him to the verge of
insanity.... Go, look at him now, he is your creation... you've seen him
though."""
"""In the first place, I must observe that Kirillov himself told me that
he is happy and that he's good."
"Your supposition that all this was going
on at the same time is almost correct."
But what of it?
"I repeat, I was
not deceiving either of you."""
"""Are you an atheist?"
"An atheist now?"""
"""Yes."""
"""And then?"""
"""Just as I was then."""
"""I wasn't asking you to treat me with respect when I began the
conversation."
"With your intellect you might have understood that,""
Shatov muttered indignantly."
"""I didn't get up at your first word, I didn't close the conversation,
I didn't go away from you, but have been sitting here ever since
submissively answering your questions and... cries, so it seems I have
not been lacking in respect to you yet."""
"Shatov interrupted, waving his hand."
"""Do you remember your expression that 'an atheist can't be a Russian,'
that 'an atheist at once ceases to be a Russian'?"
"Do you remember saying
that?"""
"""Did I?"""
Nikolay Vsyevolodovitch questioned him back.
"""You ask?"
You've forgotten?
"And yet that was one of the truest statements
of the leading peculiarity of the Russian soul, which you divined."
"You
can't have forgotten it!"
"I will remind you of something else: you said
then that 'a man who was not orthodox could not be Russian.'"""
"""I imagine that's a Slavophil idea."""
"""The Slavophils of to-day disown it."
"Nowadays, people have grown
cleverer."
"But you went further: you believed that Roman Catholicism was
not Christianity; you asserted that Rome proclaimed Christ subject to
the third temptation of the devil."
"Announcing to all the world that
Christ without an earthly kingdom cannot hold his ground upon earth,
Catholicism by so doing proclaimed Antichrist and ruined the whole
Western world."
"You pointed out that if France is in agonies now it's
simply the fault of Catholicism, for she has rejected the iniquitous God
of Rome and has not found a new one."
That's what you could say then!
"I
remember our conversations."""
"""If I believed, no doubt I should repeat it even now."
"I wasn't lying
when I spoke as though I had faith,"" Nikolay Vsyevolodovitch pronounced
very earnestly."
"""But I must tell you, this repetition of my ideas in the
past makes a very disagreeable impression on me."
"Can't you leave off?"""
"""If you believe it?"""
"repeated Shatov, paying not the slightest attention
to this request."
"""But didn't you tell me that if it were mathematically
proved to you that the truth excludes Christ, you'd prefer to stick to
Christ rather than to the truth?"
Did you say that?
"Did you?"""
"""But allow me too at last to ask a question,"" said Nikolay
Vsyevolodovitch, raising his voice."
"""What is the object of this
irritable and... malicious cross-examination?"""
"""This examination will be over for all eternity, and you will never hear
it mentioned again."""
"""You keep insisting that we are outside the limits of time and space."""
"""Hold your tongue!"""
Shatov cried suddenly.
"""I am stupid and awkward, but
let my name perish in ignominy!"
"Let me repeat your leading idea.... Oh,
only a dozen lines, only the conclusion."""
"""Repeat it, if it's only the conclusion...."" Stavrogin made a movement
to look at his watch, but restrained himself and did not look."
"Shatov bent forward in his chair again and again held up his finger for
a moment."
"""Not a single nation,"" he went on, as though reading it line by line,
still gazing menacingly at Stavrogin, ""not a single nation has ever
been founded on principles of science or reason."
"There has never been
an example of it, except for a brief moment, through folly."
"Socialism
is from its very nature bound to be atheism, seeing that it has from the
very first proclaimed that it is an atheistic organisation of society,
and that it intends to establish itself exclusively on the elements of
science and reason."
"Science and reason have, from the beginning of time,
played a secondary and subordinate part in the life of nations; so it
will be till the end of time."
"Nations are built up and moved by another
force which sways and dominates them, the origin of which is unknown and
inexplicable: that force is the force of an insatiable desire to go on
to the end, though at the same time it denies that end."
"It is the force
of the persistent assertion of one's own existence, and a denial of
death."
"It's the spirit of life, as the Scriptures call it, 'the river of
living water,' the drying up of which is threatened in the Apocalypse."
"It's the æsthetic principle, as the philosophers call it, the ethical
principle with which they identify it, 'the seeking for God,' as I call
it more simply."
"The object of every national movement, in every people
and at every period of its existence is only the seeking for its god,
who must be its own god, and the faith in Him as the only true one."
"God is the synthetic personality of the whole people, taken from its
beginning to its end."
"It has never happened that all, or even many,
peoples have had one common god, but each has always had its own."
"It's
a sign of the decay of nations when they begin to have gods in common."
"When gods begin to be common to several nations the gods are dying and
the faith in them, together with the nations themselves."
"The stronger
a people the more individual their God."
"There never has been a nation
without a religion, that is, without an idea of good and evil."
"Every
people has its own conception of good and evil, and its own good and
evil."
"When the same conceptions of good and evil become prevalent
in several nations, then these nations are dying, and then the very
distinction between good and evil is beginning to disappear."
"Reason
has never had the power to define good and evil, or even to distinguish
between good and evil, even approximately; on the contrary, it has
always mixed them up in a disgraceful and pitiful way; science has even
given the solution by the fist."
"This is particularly characteristic
of the half-truths of science, the most terrible scourge of humanity,
unknown till this century, and worse than plague, famine, or war."
"A
half-truth is a despot... such as has never been in the world before."
"A despot that has its priests and its slaves, a despot to whom all do
homage with love and superstition hitherto inconceivable, before which
science itself trembles and cringes in a shameful way."
"These are your
own words, Stavrogin, all except that about the half-truth; that's my
own because I am myself a case of half-knowledge, and that's why I hate
it particularly."
"I haven't altered anything of your ideas or even of
your words, not a syllable."""
"""I don't agree that you've not altered anything,"" Stavrogin observed
cautiously."
"""You accepted them with ardour, and in your ardour have
transformed them unconsciously."
"The very fact that you reduce God to a
simple attribute of nationality...""

He suddenly began watching Shatov with intense and peculiar attention,
not so much his words as himself."
"""I reduce God to the attribute of nationality?"""
cried Shatov.
"""On the
contrary, I raise the people to God."
And has it ever been otherwise?
"The
people is the body of God."
"Every people is only a people so long as it
has its own god and excludes all other gods on earth irreconcilably; so
long as it believes that by its god it will conquer and drive out of
the world all other gods."
"Such, from the beginning of time, has been
the belief of all great nations, all, anyway, who have been specially
remarkable, all who have been leaders of humanity."
"There is no going
against facts."
"The Jews lived only to await the coming of the true
God and left the world the true God."
"The Greeks deified nature and
bequeathed the world their religion, that is, philosophy and art."
"Rome
deified the people in the State, and bequeathed the idea of the State to
the nations."
"France throughout her long history was only the incarnation
and development of the Roman god, and if they have at last flung their
Roman god into the abyss and plunged into atheism, which, for the time
being, they call socialism, it is solely because socialism is, anyway,
healthier than Roman Catholicism."
"If a great people does not believe
that the truth is only to be found in itself alone (in itself alone
and in it exclusively); if it does not believe that it alone is fit and
destined to raise up and save all the rest by its truth, it would at
once sink into being ethnographical material, and not a great people."
"A
really great people can never accept a secondary part in the history
of Humanity, nor even one of the first, but will have the first part."
"A
nation which loses this belief ceases to be a nation."
"But there is only
one truth, and therefore only a single one out of the nations can have
the true God, even though other nations may have great gods of their
own."
"Only one nation is 'god-bearing,' that's the Russian people,
and... and... and can you think me such a fool, Stavrogin,"" he yelled
frantically all at once, ""that I can't distinguish whether my words at
this moment are the rotten old commonplaces that have been ground out in
all the Slavophil mills in Moscow, or a perfectly new saying, the last
word, the sole word of renewal and resurrection, and... and what do I
care for your laughter at this minute!"
"What do I care that you utterly,
utterly fail to understand me, not a word, not a sound!"
"Oh, how I
despise your haughty laughter and your look at this minute!"""
He jumped up from his seat; there was positively foam on his lips.
"""On the contrary Shatov, on the contrary,"" Stavrogin began with
extraordinary earnestness and self-control, still keeping his seat, ""on
the contrary, your fervent words have revived many extremely powerful
recollections in me."
"In your words I recognise my own mood two years
ago, and now I will not tell you, as I did just now, that you have
exaggerated my ideas."
"I believe, indeed, that they were even more
exceptional, even more independent, and I assure you for the third time
that I should be very glad to confirm all that you've said just now,
every syllable of it, but...""

""But you want a hare?"""
"""Wh-a-t?"""
"""Your own nasty expression,"" Shatov laughed spitefully, sitting down
again."
"""To cook your hare you must first catch it, to believe in God
you must first have a god."
"You used to say that in Petersburg, I'm told,
like Nozdryov, who tried to catch a hare by his hind legs."""
"""No, what he did was to boast he'd caught him."
"By the way, allow me to
trouble you with a question though, for indeed I think I have the right
to one now."
"Tell me, have you caught your hare?"""
"""Don't dare to ask me in such words!"
"Ask differently, quite
differently."""
Shatov suddenly began trembling all over.
"""Certainly I'll ask differently."""
"Nikolay Vsyevolodovitch looked coldly
at him."
"""I only wanted to know, do you believe in God, yourself?"""
"""I believe in Russia...."
I believe in her orthodoxy....
"I believe in
the body of Christ...."
"I believe that the new advent will take place in
Russia...."
"I believe..."" Shatov muttered frantically."
"""And in God?"
"In God?"""
"""I..."
"I will believe in God."""
Not one muscle moved in Stavrogin's face.
"Shatov looked passionately and
defiantly at him, as though he would have scorched him with his eyes."
"""I haven't told you that I don't believe,"" he cried at last."
"""I will
only have you know that I am a luckless, tedious book, and nothing more
so far, so far...."
But confound me!
We're discussing you not me....
"I'm
a man of no talent, and can only give my blood, nothing more, like every
man without talent; never mind my blood either!"
I'm talking about you.
I've been waiting here two years for you....
"Here I've been dancing
about in my nakedness before you for the last half-hour."
"You, only you
can raise that flag!..."""
"He broke off, and sat as though in despair, with his elbows on the table
and his head in his hands."
"""I merely mention it as something queer,"" Stavrogin interrupted
suddenly."
"""Every one for some inexplicable reason keeps foisting a flag
upon me."
"Pyotr Verhovensky, too, is convinced that I might 'raise his
flag,' that's how his words were repeated to me, anyway."
"He has taken it
into his head that I'm capable of playing the part of Stenka Razin for
them, 'from my extraordinary aptitude for crime,' his saying too."""
"""What?"""
"cried Shatov, ""'from your extraordinary aptitude for crime'?"""
"""Just so."""
"""H'm!"
"And is it true?"""
"he asked, with an angry smile."
"""Is it true
that when you were in Petersburg you belonged to a secret society for
practising beastly sensuality?"
"Is it true that you could give lessons to
the Marquis de Sade?"
Is it true that you decoyed and corrupted children?
"Speak, don't dare to lie,"" he cried, beside himself."
"""Nikolay Stavrogin
cannot lie to Shatov, who struck him in the face."
"Tell me everything,
and if it's true I'll kill you, here, on the spot!"""
"""I did talk like that, but it was not I who outraged children,""
Stavrogin brought out, after a silence that lasted too long."
"He turned
pale and his eyes gleamed."
"""But you talked like that,"" Shatov went on imperiously, keeping his
flashing eyes fastened upon him."
"""Is it true that you declared that you
saw no distinction in beauty between some brutal obscene action and any
great exploit, even the sacrifice of life for the good of humanity?"
"Is
it true that you have found identical beauty, equal enjoyment, in both
extremes?"""
"""It's impossible to answer like this...."
"I won't answer,"" muttered
Stavrogin, who might well have got up and gone away, but who did not get
up and go away."
"""I don't know either why evil is hateful and good is beautiful, but I
know why the sense of that distinction is effaced and lost in people
like the Stavrogins,"" Shatov persisted, trembling all over."
"""Do you know
why you made that base and shameful marriage?"
"Simply because the shame
and senselessness of it reached the pitch of genius!"
"Oh, you are not
one of those who linger on the brink."
You fly head foremost.
"You married
from a passion for martyrdom, from a craving for remorse, through moral
sensuality."
"It was a laceration of the nerves... Defiance of common
sense was too tempting."
"Stavrogin and a wretched, half-witted, crippled
beggar!"
When you bit the governor's ear did you feel sensual pleasure?
Did you?
"You idle, loafing, little snob."
"Did you?"""
"""You're a psychologist,"" said Stavrogin, turning paler and paler,
""though you're partly mistaken as to the reasons of my marriage."
"But
who can have given you all this information?"""
"he asked, smiling, with an
effort."
"""Was it Kirillov?"
"But he had nothing to do with it."""
"""You turn pale."""
"""But what is it you want?"""
"Nikolay Vsyevolodovitch asked, raising
his voice at last."
"""I've been sitting under your lash for the last
half-hour, and you might at least let me go civilly."
"Unless you really
have some reasonable object in treating me like this."""
"""Reasonable object?"""
"""Of course, you're in duty bound, anyway, to let me know your object."
"I've been expecting you to do so all the time, but you've shown me
nothing so far but frenzied spite."
"I beg you to open the gate for me."""
He got up from the chair.
Shatov rushed frantically after him.
"""Kiss
the earth, water it with your tears, pray for forgiveness,"" he cried,
clutching him by the shoulder."
"""I didn't kill you... that morning, though..."
"I drew back my
hands..."" Stavrogin brought out almost with anguish, keeping his eyes
on the ground."
"""Speak out!"
Speak out!
You came to warn me of danger.
"You have let me
speak."
"You mean to-morrow to announce your marriage publicly.... Do
you suppose I don't see from your face that some new menacing idea
is dominating you?..."
"Stavrogin, why am I condemned to believe in you
through all eternity?"
Could I speak like this to anyone else?
"I have
modesty, but I am not ashamed of my nakedness because it's Stavrogin
I am speaking to."
"I was not afraid of caricaturing a grand idea by
handling it because Stavrogin was listening to me.... Shan't I kiss your
footprints when you've gone?"
"I can't tear you out of my heart, Nikolay
Stavrogin!"""
"""I'm sorry I can't feel affection for you, Shatov,"" Stavrogin replied
coldly."
"""I know you can't, and I know you are not lying."
Listen.
"I can set it
all right."
"I can 'catch your hare' for you."""
Stavrogin did not speak.
"""You're an atheist because you're a snob, a snob of the snobs."
"You've
lost the distinction between good and evil because you've lost touch
with your own people."
"A new generation is coming, straight from the
heart of the people, and you will know nothing of it, neither you nor
the Verhovenskys, father or son; nor I, for I'm a snob too--I, the son
of your serf and lackey, Pashka...."
Listen.
"Attain to God by work; it
all lies in that; or disappear like rotten mildew."
"Attain to Him by
work."""
"""God by work?"
"What sort of work?"""
"""Peasants' work."
"Go, give up all your wealth.... Ah!"
"you laugh, you're
afraid of some trick?"""
But Stavrogin was not laughing.
"""You suppose that one may attain to God by work, and by peasants' work,""
he repeated, reflecting as though he had really come across something
new and serious which was worth considering."
"""By the way,"" he passed
suddenly to a new idea, ""you reminded me just now."
"Do you know that
I'm not rich at all, that I've nothing to give up?"
"I'm scarcely in
a position even to provide for Marya Timofyevna's future.... Another
thing: I came to ask you if it would be possible for you to remain near
Marya Timofyevna in the future, as you are the only person who has
some influence over her poor brain."
"I say this so as to be prepared for
anything."""
"""All right, all right."
"You're speaking of Marya Timofyevna,"" said
Shatov, waving one hand, while he held a candle in the other."
"""All
right."
"Afterwards, of course...."
Listen.
"Go to Tikhon."""
"""To whom?"""
"""To Tikhon, who used to be a bishop."
"He lives retired now, on account of
illness, here in the town, in the Bogorodsky monastery."""
"""What do you mean?"""
"""Nothing."
People go and see him.
You go.
What is it to you?
"What is it
to you?"""
"""It's the first time I've heard of him, and..."
"I've never seen anything
of that sort of people."
"Thank you, I'll go."""
"""This way."""
Shatov lighted him down the stairs.
"""Go along."""
"He flung open the gate
into the street."
"""I shan't come to you any more, Shatov,"" said Stavrogin quietly as he
stepped through the gateway."
The darkness and the rain continued as before.
CHAPTER II.
"NIGHT (continued)


I

HE WALKED THE LENGTH of Bogoyavlensky Street."
"At last the road began
to go downhill; his feet slipped in the mud and suddenly there lay
open before him a wide, misty, as it were empty expanse--the river."
"The
houses were replaced by hovels; the street was lost in a multitude of
irregular little alleys."
"Nikolay Vsyevolodovitch was a long while making his way between
the fences, keeping close to the river bank, but finding his way
confidently, and scarcely giving it a thought indeed."
"He was absorbed in
something quite different, and looked round with surprise when suddenly,
waking up from a profound reverie, he found himself almost in the middle
of one long, wet, floating bridge."
"There was not a soul to be seen, so that it seemed strange to him when
suddenly, almost at his elbow, he heard a deferentially familiar, but
rather pleasant, voice, with a suave intonation, such as is affected by
our over-refined tradespeople or befrizzled young shop assistants."
"""Will you kindly allow me, sir, to share your umbrella?"""
"There actually was a figure that crept under his umbrella, or tried to
appear to do so."
"The tramp was walking beside him, almost ""feeling
his elbow,"" as the soldiers say."
"Slackening his pace, Nikolay
Vsyevolodovitch bent down to look more closely, as far as he could, in
the darkness."
"It was a short man, and seemed like an artisan who had
been drinking; he was shabbily and scantily dressed; a cloth cap, soaked
by the rain and with the brim half torn off, perched on his shaggy,
curly head."
"He looked a thin, vigorous, swarthy man with dark hair;
his eyes were large and must have been black, with a hard glitter and a
yellow tinge in them, like a gipsy's; that could be divined even in the
darkness."
"He was about forty, and was not drunk."
"""Do you know me?"""
asked Nikolay Vsyevolodovitch.
"""Mr. Stavrogin, Nikolay
Vsyevolodovitch."
"You were pointed out to me at the station, when the
train stopped last Sunday, though I had heard enough of you beforehand."""
"""From Pyotr Stepanovitch?"
"Are you... Fedka the convict?"""
"""I was christened Fyodor Fyodorovitch."
"My mother is living to this day
in these parts; she's an old woman, and grows more and more bent every
day."
"She prays to God for me, day and night, so that she doesn't waste
her old age lying on the stove."""
"""You escaped from prison?"""
"""I've had a change of luck."
"I gave up books and bells and church-going
because I'd a life sentence, so that I had a very long time to finish my
term."""
"""What are you doing here?"""
"""Well, I do what I can."
"My uncle, too, died last week in prison here."
"He
was there for false coin, so I threw two dozen stones at the dogs by
way of memorial."
That's all I've been doing so far.
"Moreover Pyotr
Stepanovitch gives me hopes of a passport, and a merchant's one, too, to
go all over Russia, so I'm waiting on his kindness."
"'Because,' says he,
'my papa lost you at cards at the English club, and I,' says he, 'find
that inhumanity unjust.'"
"You might have the kindness to give me three
roubles, sir, for a glass to warm myself."""
"""So you've been spying on me."
I don't like that.
"By whose orders?"""
"""As to orders, it's nothing of the sort; it's simply that I knew of your
benevolence, which is known to all the world."
"All we get, as you know,
is an armful of hay, or a prod with a fork."
"Last Friday I filled myself
as full of pie as Martin did of soap; since then I didn't eat one day,
and the day after I fasted, and on the third I'd nothing again."
"I've had
my fill of water from the river."
I'm breeding fish in my belly....
"So
won't your honour give me something?"
"I've a sweetheart expecting me not
far from here, but I daren't show myself to her without money."""
"""What did Pyotr Stepanovitch promise you from me?"""
"""He didn't exactly promise anything, but only said that I might be of
use to your honour if my luck turns out good, but how exactly he didn't
explain; for Pyotr Stepanovitch wants to see if I have the patience of a
Cossack, and feels no sort of confidence in me."""
"""Why?"""
"""Pyotr Stepanovitch is an astronomer, and has learnt all God's planets,
but even he may be criticised."
"I stand before you, sir, as before God,
because I have heard so much about you."
"Pyotr Stepanovitch is one thing,
but you, sir, maybe, are something else."
"When he's said of a man he's a
scoundrel, he knows nothing more about him except that he's a scoundrel."
"Or if he's said he's a fool, then that man has no calling with him
except that of fool."
"But I may be a fool Tuesday and Wednesday, and on
Thursday wiser than he."
"Here now he knows about me that I'm awfully
sick to get a passport, for there's no getting on in Russia without
papers--so he thinks that he's snared my soul."
"I tell you, sir, life's
a very easy business for Pyotr Stepanovitch, for he fancies a man to be
this and that, and goes on as though he really was."
"And, what's more,
he's beastly stingy."
"It's his notion that, apart from him, I daren't
trouble you, but I stand before you, sir, as before God."
"This is the
fourth night I've been waiting for your honour on this bridge, to show
that I can find my own way on the quiet, without him."
"I'd better bow to
a boot, thinks I, than to a peasant's shoe."""
"""And who told you that I was going to cross the bridge at night?"""
"""Well, that, I'll own, came out by chance, most through Captain
Lebyadkin's foolishness, because he can't keep anything to himself...."
"So that three roubles from your honour would pay me for the weary time
I've had these three days and nights."
"And the clothes I've had soaked, I
feel that too much to speak of it."""
"""I'm going to the left; you'll go to the right."
"Here's the end of the
bridge."
"Listen, Fyodor; I like people to understand what I say, once for
all."
I won't give you a farthing.
"Don't meet me in future on the bridge
or anywhere."
"I've no need of you, and never shall have, and if you don't
obey, I'll tie you and take you to the police."
"March!"""
"""Eh-heh!"
"Fling me something for my company, anyhow."
"I've cheered you on
your way."""
"""Be off!"""
"""But do you know the way here?"
There are all sorts of turnings....
"I
could guide you; for this town is for all the world as though the devil
carried it in his basket and dropped it in bits here and there."""
"""I'll tie you up!"""
"said Nikolay Vsyevolodovitch, turning upon him
menacingly."
"""Perhaps you'll change your mind, sir; it's easy to ill-treat the
helpless."""
"""Well, I see you can rely on yourself!"""
"""I rely upon you, sir, and not very much on myself....""

""I've no need of you at all."
"I've told you so already."""
"""But I have need, that's how it is!"
"I shall wait for you on the way
back."
"There's nothing for it."""
"""I give you my word of honour if I meet you I'll tie you up."""
"""Well, I'll get a belt ready for you to tie me with."
"A lucky journey to
you, sir."
You kept the helpless snug under your umbrella.
"For that
alone I'll be grateful to you to my dying day."""
He fell behind.
"Nikolay
Vsyevolodovitch walked on to his destination, feeling disturbed."
"This
man who had dropped from the sky was absolutely convinced that he was
indispensable to him, Stavrogin, and was in insolent haste to tell him
so."
He was being treated unceremoniously all round.
"But it was possible,
too, that the tramp had not been altogether lying, and had tried
to force his services upon him on his own initiative, without Pyotr
Stepanovitch's knowledge, and that would be more curious still."
"II

The house which Nikolay Vsyevolodovitch had reached stood alone in a
deserted lane between fences, beyond which market gardens stretched, at
the very end of the town."
"It was a very solitary little wooden house,
which was only just built and not yet weather-boarded."
"In one of the
little windows the shutters were not yet closed, and there was a candle
standing on the window-ledge, evidently as a signal to the late guest
who was expected that night."
"Thirty paces away Stavrogin made out on the
doorstep the figure of a tall man, evidently the master of the house,
who had come out to stare impatiently up the road."
"He heard his voice,
too, impatient and, as it were, timid."
"""Is that you?"
"You?"""
"""Yes,"" responded Nikolay Vsyevolodovitch, but not till he had mounted
the steps and was folding up his umbrella."
"""At last, sir."""
"Captain Lebyadkin, for it was he, ran fussily to and
fro."
"""Let me take your umbrella, please."
"It's very wet; I'll open it on
the floor here, in the corner."
Please walk in.
"Please walk in."""
"The door was open from the passage into a room that was lighted by two
candles."
"""If it had not been for your promise that you would certainly come, I
should have given up expecting you."""
"""A quarter to one,"" said Nikolay Vsyevolodovitch, looking at his watch,
as he went into the room."
"""And in this rain; and such an interesting distance."
"I've no clock...
and there are nothing but market-gardens round me... so that you fall
behind the times."
"Not that I murmur exactly; for I dare not, I dare not,
but only because I've been devoured with impatience all the week... to
have things settled at last."""
"""How so?"""
"""To hear my fate, Nikolay Vsyevolodovitch."
"Please sit down."""
"He bowed, pointing to a seat by the table, before the sofa."
Nikolay Vsyevolodovitch looked round.
The room was tiny and low-pitched.
"The furniture consisted only of the most essential articles, plain
wooden chairs and a sofa, also newly made without covering or cushions."
"There were two tables of limewood; one by the sofa, and the other in
the corner was covered with a table-cloth, laid with things over which
a clean table-napkin had been thrown."
"And, indeed, the whole room was
obviously kept extremely clean."
Captain Lebyadkin had not been drunk for eight days.
"His face looked
bloated and yellow."
"His eyes looked uneasy, inquisitive, and obviously
bewildered."
"It was only too evident that he did not know what tone he
could adopt, and what line it would be most advantageous for him to
take."
"""Here,"" he indicated his surroundings, ""I live like Zossima."
"Sobriety,
solitude, and poverty--the vow of the knights of old."""
"""You imagine that the knights of old took such vows?"""
"""Perhaps I'm mistaken."
Alas!
I have no culture.
I've ruined all.
"Believe
me, Nikolay Vsyevolodovitch, here first I have recovered from shameful
propensities--not a glass nor a drop!"
"I have a home, and for six days
past I have experienced a conscience at ease."
"Even the walls smell of
resin and remind me of nature."
And what have I been; what was I?
"'At night without a bed I wander
     And my tongue put out by day...'

to use the words of a poet of genius."
"But you're wet through....
Wouldn't you like some tea?"""
"""Don't trouble."""
"""The samovar has been boiling since eight o'clock, but it went out at
last like everything in this world."
"The sun, too, they say, will go
out in its turn."
But if you like I'll get up the samovar.
"Agafya is not
asleep."""
"""Tell me, Marya Timofyevna...""

""She's here, here,"" Lebyadkin replied at once, in a whisper."
"""Would you
like to have a look at her?"""
"He pointed to the closed door to the next
room."
"""She's not asleep?"""
"""Oh, no, no."
How could she be?
"On the contrary, she's been expecting
you all the evening, and as soon as she heard you were coming she began
making her toilet."""
"He was just twisting his mouth into a jocose smile, but he instantly
checked himself."
"""How is she, on the whole?"""
"asked Nikolay Vsyevolodovitch, frowning."
"""On the whole?"
"You know that yourself, sir."""
"He shrugged his shoulders
commiseratingly."
"""But just now... just now she's telling her fortune
with cards....""

""Very good."
Later on.
"First of all I must finish with you."""
Nikolay Vsyevolodovitch settled himself in a chair.
"The captain did not
venture to sit down on the sofa, but at once moved up another chair for
himself, and bent forward to listen, in a tremor of expectation."
"""What have you got there under the table-cloth?"""
"asked Nikolay
Vsyevolodovitch, suddenly noticing it."
"""That?"""
"said Lebyadkin, turning towards it also."
"""That's from your
generosity, by way of house-warming, so to say; considering also
the length of the walk, and your natural fatigue,"" he sniggered
ingratiatingly."
"Then he got up on tiptoe, and respectfully and carefully
lifted the table-cloth from the table in the corner."
"Under it was seen a
slight meal: ham, veal, sardines, cheese, a little green decanter, and a
long bottle of Bordeaux."
"Everything had been laid neatly, expertly, and
almost daintily."
"""Was that your effort?"""
"""Yes, sir."
"Ever since yesterday I've done my best, and all to do you
honour.... Marya Timofyevna doesn't trouble herself, as you know, on
that score."
"And what's more its all from your liberality, your own
providing, as you're the master of the house and not I, and I'm only, so
to say, your agent."
"All the same, all the same, Nikolay Vsyevolodovitch,
all the same, in spirit, I'm independent!"
"Don't take away from me this
last possession!"""
he finished up pathetically.
"""H'm!"
"You might sit down again."""
"""Gra-a-teful, grateful, and independent."""
He sat down.
"""Ah, Nikolay
Vsyevolodovitch, so much has been fermenting in this heart that I have
not known how to wait for your coming."
"Now you will decide my fate,
and... that unhappy creature's, and then... shall I pour out all I feel
to you as I used to in old days, four years ago?"
"You deigned to listen
to me then, you read my verses...."
"They might call me your Falstaff from
Shakespeare in those days, but you meant so much in my life!"
"I have
great terrors now, and it's only to you I look for counsel and light."
"Pyotr Stepanovitch is treating me abominably!"""
"Nikolay Vsyevolodovitch listened with interest, and looked at him
attentively."
"It was evident that though Captain Lebyadkin had left off
drinking he was far from being in a harmonious state of mind."
"Drunkards of many years' standing, like Lebyadkin, often show traces of
incoherence, of mental cloudiness, of something, as it were, damaged,
and crazy, though they may deceive, cheat, and swindle, almost as well
as anybody if occasion arises."
"""I see that you haven't changed a bit in these four years and more,
captain,"" said Nikolay Vsyevolodovitch, somewhat more amiably."
"""It
seems, in fact, as though the second half of a man's life is usually
made up of nothing but the habits he has accumulated during the first
half."""
"""Grand words!"
"You solve the riddle of life!"""
"said the captain, half
cunningly, half in genuine and unfeigned admiration, for he was a
great lover of words."
"""Of all your sayings, Nikolay Vsyevolodovitch, I
remember one thing above all; you were in Petersburg when you said it:
'One must really be a great man to be able to make a stand even against
common sense.'"
"That was it."""
"""Yes, and a fool as well."""
"""A fool as well, maybe."
"But you've been scattering clever sayings all
your life, while they...."
"Imagine Liputin, imagine Pyotr Stepanovitch
saying anything like that!"
"Oh, how cruelly Pyotr Stepanovitch has
treated me!"""
"""But how about yourself, captain?"
"What can you say of your behaviour?"""
"""Drunkenness, and the multitude of my enemies."
"But now that's all over,
all over, and I have a new skin, like a snake."
"Do you know, Nikolay
Vsyevolodovitch, I am making my will; in fact, I've made it already?"""
"""That's interesting."
"What are you leaving, and to whom?"""
"""To my fatherland, to humanity, and to the students."
"Nikolay
Vsyevolodovitch, I read in the paper the biography of an American."
"He
left all his vast fortune to factories and to the exact sciences, and
his skeleton to the students of the academy there, and his skin to be
made into a drum, so that the American national hymn might be beaten
upon it day and night."
Alas!
"we are pigmies in mind compared with the
soaring thought of the States of North America."
"Russia is the play of
nature but not of mind."
"If I were to try leaving my skin for a drum, for
instance, to the Akmolinsky infantry regiment, in which I had the honour
of beginning my service, on condition of beating the Russian national
hymn upon it every day, in face of the regiment, they'd take it for
liberalism and prohibit my skin... and so I confine myself to the
students."
"I want to leave my skeleton to the academy, but on the
condition though, on the condition that a label should be stuck on the
forehead forever and ever, with the words: 'A repentant free-thinker.'"
"There now!"""
"The captain spoke excitedly, and genuinely believed, of course, that
there was something fine in the American will, but he was cunning too,
and very anxious to entertain Nikolay Vsyevolodovitch, with whom he had
played the part of a buffoon for a long time in the past."
"But the latter
did not even smile, on the contrary, he asked, as it were, suspiciously:

""So you intend to publish your will in your lifetime and get rewarded
for it?"""
"""And what if I do, Nikolay Vsyevolodovitch?"
"What if I do?"""
"said
Lebyadkin, watching him carefully."
"""What sort of luck have I had?"
"I've
given up writing poetry, and at one time even you were amused by my
verses, Nikolay Vsyevolodovitch."
"Do you remember our reading them over a
bottle?"
But it's all over with my pen.
"I've written only one poem, like
Gogol's 'The Last Story.'"
"Do you remember he proclaimed to Russia that
it broke spontaneously from his bosom?"
"It's the same with me; I've sung
my last and it's over."""
"""What sort of poem?"""
"""'In case she were to break her leg.'"""
"""Wha-a-t?"""
That was all the captain was waiting for.
"He had an unbounded admiration
for his own poems, but, through a certain cunning duplicity, he was
pleased, too, that Nikolay Vsyevolodovitch always made merry over his
poems, and sometimes laughed at them immoderately."
"In this way he killed
two birds with one stone, satisfying at once his poetical aspirations
and his desire to be of service; but now he had a third special and very
ticklish object in view."
"Bringing his verses on the scene, the captain
thought to exculpate himself on one point about which, for some reason,
he always felt himself most apprehensive, and most guilty."
"""'In case of her breaking her leg.'"
"That is, of her riding on
horseback."
"It's a fantasy, Nikolay Vsyevolodovitch, a wild fancy,
but the fancy of a poet."
"One day I was struck by meeting a lady on
horseback, and asked myself the vital question, 'What would happen
then?'"
"That is, in case of accident."
"All her followers turn away, all
her suitors are gone."
A pretty kettle of fish.
"Only the poet
remains faithful, with his heart shattered in his breast, Nikolay
Vsyevolodovitch."
"Even a louse may be in love, and is not forbidden by
law."
And yet the lady was offended by the letter and the verses.
"I'm
told that even you were angry."
Were you?
"I wouldn't believe in anything
so grievous."
Whom could I harm simply by imagination?
"Besides, I swear
on my honour, Liputin kept saying, 'Send it, send it,' every man,
however humble, has a right to send a letter!"
"And so I sent it."""
"""You offered yourself as a suitor, I understand."""
"""Enemies, enemies, enemies!"""
"""Repeat the verses,"" said Nikolay Vsyevolodovitch sternly."
"""Ravings, ravings, more than anything."""
"However, he drew himself up, stretched out his hand, and began:

     ""With broken limbs my beauteous queen
     Is twice as charming as before,
     And, deep in love as I have been,
     To-day I love her even more."""
"""Come, that's enough,"" said Nikolay Vsyevolodovitch, with a wave of his hand."
"""I dream of Petersburg,"" cried Lebyadkin, passing quickly to another
subject, as though there had been no mention of verses."
"""I dream of
regeneration.... Benefactor!"
"May I reckon that you won't refuse the means
for the journey?"
"I've been waiting for you all the week as my sunshine."""
"""I'll do nothing of the sort."
I've scarcely any money left.
"And why
should I give you money?"""
Nikolay Vsyevolodovitch seemed suddenly angry.
"Dryly and briefly he
recapitulated all the captain's misdeeds; his drunkenness, his lying,
his squandering of the money meant for Marya Timofyevna, his having
taken her from the nunnery, his insolent letters threatening to publish
the secret, the way he had behaved about Darya Pavlovna, and so on, and
so on."
"The captain heaved, gesticulated, began to reply, but every time
Nikolay Vsyevolodovitch stopped him peremptorily."
"""And listen,"" he observed at last, ""you keep writing about 'family
disgrace.'"
"What disgrace is it to you that your sister is the lawful
wife of a Stavrogin?"""
"""But marriage in secret, Nikolay Vsyevolodovitch--a fatal secret."
"I
receive money from you, and I'm suddenly asked the question, 'What's
that money for?'"
"My hands are tied; I cannot answer to the detriment of
my sister, to the detriment of the family honour."""
The captain raised his voice.
"He liked that subject and reckoned boldly
upon it."
Alas!
he did not realise what a blow was in store for him.
"Calmly and exactly, as though he were speaking of the most everyday
arrangement, Nikolay Vsyevolodovitch informed him that in a few days,
perhaps even to-morrow or the day after, he intended to make his
marriage known everywhere, ""to the police as well as to local society."""
"And so the question of family honour would be settled once for all, and
with it the question of subsidy."
"The captain's eyes were ready to
drop out of his head; he positively could not take it in."
"It had to be
explained to him."
"""But she is..."
"crazy."""
"""I shall make suitable arrangements."""
"""But... how about your mother?"""
"""Well, she must do as she likes."""
"""But will you take your wife to your house?"""
"""Perhaps so."
"But that is absolutely nothing to do with you and no
concern of yours."""
"""No concern of mine!"""
cried the captain.
"""What about me then?"""
"""Well, certainly you won't come into my house."""
"""But, you know, I'm a relation."""
"""One does one's best to escape from such relations."
"Why should I go on
giving you money then?"
"Judge for yourself."""
"""Nikolay Vsyevolodovitch, Nikolay Vsyevolodovitch, this is impossible."
"You will think better of it, perhaps?"
"You don't want to lay hands
upon.... What will people think?"
"What will the world say?"""
"""Much I care for your world."
"I married your sister when the fancy took
me, after a drunken dinner, for a bet, and now I'll make it public...
since that amuses me now."""
"He said this with a peculiar irritability, so that Lebyadkin began with
horror to believe him."
"""But me, me?"
What about me?
I'm what matters most!...
"Perhaps you're
joking, Nikolay Vsyevolodovitch?"""
"""No, I'm not joking."""
"""As you will, Nikolay Vsyevolodovitch, but I don't believe you.... Then
I'll take proceedings."""
"""You're fearfully stupid, captain."""
"""Maybe, but this is all that's left me,"" said the captain, losing his
head completely."
"""In old days we used to get free quarters, anyway, for
the work she did in the 'corners.'"
"But what will happen now if you throw
me over altogether?"""
"""But you want to go to Petersburg to try a new career."
"By the way, is it
true what I hear, that you mean to go and give information, in the hope
of obtaining a pardon, by betraying all the others?"""
"The captain stood gaping with wide-open eyes, and made no answer."
"""Listen, captain,"" Stavrogin began suddenly, with great earnestness,
bending down to the table."
"Until then he had been talking, as it were,
ambiguously, so that Lebyadkin, who had wide experience in playing the
part of buffoon, was up to the last moment a trifle uncertain whether
his patron were really angry or simply putting it on; whether he really
had the wild intention of making his marriage public, or whether he
were only playing."
"Now Nikolay Vsyevolodovitch's stern expression was so
convincing that a shiver ran down the captain's back."
"""Listen, and tell the truth, Lebyadkin."
"Have you betrayed anything yet,
or not?"
Have you succeeded in doing anything really?
"Have you sent a
letter to somebody in your foolishness?"""
"""No, I haven't... and I haven't thought of doing it,"" said the captain,
looking fixedly at him."
"""That's a lie, that you haven't thought of doing it."
"That's what you're
asking to go to Petersburg for."
"If you haven't written, have you blabbed
to anybody here?"
Speak the truth.
"I've heard something."""
"""When I was drunk, to Liputin."
Liputin's a traitor.
"I opened my heart to
him,"" whispered the poor captain."
"""That's all very well, but there's no need to be an ass."
"If you had an
idea you should have kept it to yourself."
"Sensible people hold their
tongues nowadays; they don't go chattering."""
"""Nikolay Vsyevolodovitch!"""
"said the captain, quaking."
"""You've had
nothing to do with it yourself; it's not you I've...""

""Yes."
"You wouldn't have ventured to kill the goose that laid your golden
eggs."""
"""Judge for yourself, Nikolay Vsyevolodovitch, judge for yourself,"" and,
in despair, with tears, the captain began hurriedly relating the story
of his life for the last four years."
"It was the most stupid story of
a fool, drawn into matters that did not concern him, and in his
drunkenness and debauchery unable, till the last minute, to grasp their
importance."
"He said that before he left Petersburg 'he had been drawn
in, at first simply through friendship, like a regular student, although
he wasn't a student,' and knowing nothing about it, 'without being
guilty of anything,' he had scattered various papers on staircases, left
them by dozens at doors, on bell-handles, had thrust them in as though
they were newspapers, taken them to the theatre, put them in people's
hats, and slipped them into pockets."
"Afterwards he had taken money from
them, 'for what means had I?'"
"He had distributed all sorts of rubbish
through the districts of two provinces."
"""Oh, Nikolay Vsyevolodovitch!"""
"he exclaimed, ""what revolted me most was that this was utterly opposed
to civic, and still more to patriotic laws."
"They suddenly printed that
men were to go out with pitchforks, and to remember that those who went
out poor in the morning might go home rich at night."
Only think of it!
"It made me shudder, and yet I distributed it."
"Or suddenly five or six
lines addressed to the whole of Russia, apropos of nothing, 'Make haste
and lock up the churches, abolish God, do away with marriage, destroy
the right of inheritance, take up your knives,' that's all, and God
knows what it means."
"I tell you, I almost got caught with this five-line
leaflet."
"The officers in the regiment gave me a thrashing, but, bless
them for it, let me go."
"And last year I was almost caught when I passed
off French counterfeit notes for fifty roubles on Korovayev, but, thank
God, Korovayev fell into the pond when he was drunk, and was drowned
in the nick of time, and they didn't succeed in tracking me."
"Here, at
Virginsky's, I proclaimed the freedom of the communistic life."
"In June
I was distributing manifestoes again in X district."
"They say they
will make me do it again.... Pyotr Stepanovitch suddenly gave me to
understand that I must obey; he's been threatening me a long time."
"How
he treated me that Sunday!"
"Nikolay Vsyevolodovitch, I am a slave, I am
a worm, but not a God, which is where I differ from Derzhavin."
"* But I've
no income, no income!"""
* The reference is to a poem of Derzhavin's.
Nikolay Vsyevolodovitch heard it all with curiosity.
"""A great deal of that I had heard nothing of,"" he said."
"""Of course,
anything may have happened to you...."
"Listen,"" he said, after a minute's
thought."
"""If you like, you can tell them, you know whom, that Liputin
was lying, and that you were only pretending to give information to
frighten me, supposing that I, too, was compromised, and that you might
get more money out of me that way.... Do you understand?"""
"""Dear Nikolay Vsyevolodovitch, is it possible that there's such a danger
hanging over me?"
"I've been longing for you to come, to ask you."""
Nikolay Vsyevolodovitch laughed.
"""They certainly wouldn't let you go to Petersburg, even if I were to
give you money for the journey...."
"But it's time for me to see Marya
Timofyevna."""
And he got up from his chair.
"""Nikolay Vsyevolodovitch, but how about Marya Timofyevna?"""
"""Why, as I told you."""
"""Can it be true?"""
"""You still don't believe it?"""
"""Will you really cast me off like an old worn-out shoe?"""
"""I'll see,"" laughed Nikolay Vsyevolodovitch."
"""Come, let me go."""
"""Wouldn't you like me to stand on the steps... for fear I might by
chance overhear something... for the rooms are small?"""
"""That's as well."
Stand on the steps.
"Take my umbrella."""
"""Your umbrella.... Am I worth it?"""
said the captain over-sweetly.
"""Anyone is worthy of an umbrella."""
"""At one stroke you define the minimum of human rights....""

But he was by now muttering mechanically."
"He was too much crushed by
what he had learned, and was completely thrown out of his reckoning."
"And
yet almost as soon as he had gone out on to the steps and had put up
the umbrella, there his shallow and cunning brain caught again the
ever-present, comforting idea that he was being cheated and deceived,
and if so they were afraid of him, and there was no need for him to be
afraid."
"""If they're lying and deceiving me, what's at the bottom of it?"""
"was the
thought that gnawed at his mind."
"The public announcement of the marriage
seemed to him absurd."
"""It's true that with such a wonder-worker anything
may come to pass; he lives to do harm."
"But what if he's afraid himself,
since the insult of Sunday, and afraid as he's never been before?"
"And
so he's in a hurry to declare that he'll announce it himself, from fear
that I should announce it."
"Eh, don't blunder, Lebyadkin!"
"And why does he
come on the sly, at night, if he means to make it public himself?"
"And
if he's afraid, it means that he's afraid now, at this moment, for these
few days.... Eh, don't make a mistake, Lebyadkin!"
"""He scares me with Pyotr Stepanovitch."
"Oy, I'm frightened, I'm
frightened!"
"Yes, this is what's so frightening!"
"And what induced me to
blab to Liputin."
Goodness knows what these devils are up to.
"I never can
make head or tail of it."
"Now they are all astir again as they were five
years ago."
"To whom could I give information, indeed?"
"'Haven't I written
to anyone in my foolishness?'"
H'm!
"So then I might write as though
through foolishness?"
Isn't he giving me a hint?
"'You're going to
Petersburg on purpose.'"
The sly rogue.
"I've scarcely dreamed of it, and
he guesses my dreams."
As though he were putting me up to going himself.
It's one or the other of two games he's up to.
"Either he's afraid
because he's been up to some pranks himself... or he's not afraid for
himself, but is simply egging me on to give them all away!"
"Ach, it's
terrible, Lebyadkin!"
"Ach, you must not make a blunder!"""
He was so absorbed in thought that he forgot to listen.
"It was not easy
to hear either."
"The door was a solid one, and they were talking in a
very low voice."
Nothing reached the captain but indistinct sounds.
"He
positively spat in disgust, and went out again, lost in thought, to
whistle on the steps."
"III

Marya Timofyevna's room was twice as large as the one occupied by the
captain, and furnished in the same rough style; but the table in front
of the sofa was covered with a gay-coloured table-cloth, and on it a
lamp was burning."
There was a handsome carpet on the floor.
"The bed was
screened off by a green curtain, which ran the length of the room, and
besides the sofa there stood by the table a large, soft easy chair, in
which Marya Timofyevna never sat, however."
"In the corner there was an
ikon as there had been in her old room, and a little lamp was burning
before it, and on the table were all her indispensable properties."
"The
pack of cards, the little looking-glass, the song-book, even a milk
loaf."
"Besides these there were two books with coloured pictures--one,
extracts from a popular book of travels, published for juvenile reading,
the other a collection of very light, edifying tales, for the most part
about the days of chivalry, intended for Christmas presents or school
reading."
"She had, too, an album of photographs of various sorts."
"Marya Timofyevna was, of course, expecting the visitor, as the captain
had announced."
"But when Nikolay Vsyevolodovitch went in, she was asleep,
half reclining on the sofa, propped on a woolwork cushion."
"Her visitor
closed the door after him noiselessly, and, standing still, scrutinised
the sleeping figure."
"The captain had been romancing when he told Nikolay Vsyevolodovitch she
had been dressing herself up."
"She was wearing the same dark dress as on
Sunday at Varvara Petrovna's."
"Her hair was done up in the same little
close knot at the back of her head; her long thin neck was exposed
in the same way."
"The black shawl Varvara Petrovna had given her lay
carefully folded on the sofa."
"She was coarsely rouged and powdered as
before."
Nikolay Vsyevolodovitch did not stand there more than a minute.
"She suddenly waked up, as though she were conscious of his eyes
fixed upon her; she opened her eyes, and quickly drew herself up."
"But something strange must have happened to her visitor: he remained
standing at the same place by the door."
"With a fixed and searching
glance he looked mutely and persistently into her face."
"Perhaps that
look was too grim, perhaps there was an expression of aversion in it,
even a malignant enjoyment of her fright--if it were not a fancy left by
her dreams; but suddenly, after almost a moment of expectation, the poor
woman's face wore a look of absolute terror; it twitched convulsively;
she lifted her trembling hands and suddenly burst into tears, exactly
like a frightened child; in another moment she would have screamed."
"But
Nikolay Vsyevolodovitch pulled himself together; his face changed in one
instant, and he went up to the table with the most cordial and amiable
smile."
"""I'm sorry, Marya Timofyevna, I frightened you coming in suddenly when
you were asleep,"" he said, holding out his hand to her."
The sound of his caressing words produced their effect.
"Her fear
vanished, although she still looked at him with dismay, evidently trying
to understand something."
She held out her hands timorously also.
"At last
a shy smile rose to her lips."
"""How do you do, prince?"""
"she whispered, looking at him strangely."
"""You must have had a bad dream,"" he went on, with a still more friendly
and cordial smile."
"""But how do you know that I was dreaming about that?"""
"And again she
began trembling, and started back, putting up her hand as though to
protect herself, on the point of crying again."
"""Calm yourself."
"That's
enough."
What are you afraid of?
"Surely you know me?"""
"said Nikolay
Vsyevolodovitch, trying to soothe her; but it was long before he
could succeed."
"She gazed at him dumbly with the same look of agonising
perplexity, with a painful idea in her poor brain, and she still seemed
to be trying to reach some conclusion."
"At one moment she dropped her
eyes, then suddenly scrutinised him in a rapid comprehensive glance."
"At
last, though not reassured, she seemed to come to a conclusion."
"""Sit down beside me, please, that I may look at you thoroughly later
on,"" she brought out with more firmness, evidently with a new object."
"""But don't be uneasy, I won't look at you now."
I'll look down.
"Don't you
look at me either till I ask you to."
"Sit down,"" she added, with positive
impatience."
A new sensation was obviously growing stronger and stronger in her.
Nikolay Vsyevolodovitch sat down and waited.
"Rather a long silence
followed."
"""H'm!"
"It all seems so strange to me,"" she suddenly muttered almost
disdainfully."
"""Of course I was depressed by bad dreams, but why have I
dreamt of you looking like that?"""
"""Come, let's have done with dreams,"" he said impatiently, turning to her
in spite of her prohibition, and perhaps the same expression gleamed for
a moment in his eyes again."
"He saw that she several times wanted, very
much in fact, to look at him again, but that she obstinately controlled
herself and kept her eyes cast down."
"""Listen, prince,"" she raised her voice suddenly, ""listen prince....""

""Why do you turn away?"
Why don't you look at me?
"What's the object of
this farce?"""
"he cried, losing patience."
But she seemed not to hear him.
"""Listen, prince,"" she repeated for the third time in a resolute voice,
with a disagreeable, fussy expression."
"""When you told me in the carriage
that our marriage was going to be made public, I was alarmed at there
being an end to the mystery."
Now I don't know.
"I've been thinking it all
over, and I see clearly that I'm not fit for it at all."
"I know how to
dress, and I could receive guests, perhaps."
"There's nothing much in
asking people to have a cup of tea, especially when there are footmen."
But what will people say though?
"I saw a great deal that Sunday morning
in that house."
"That pretty young lady looked at me all the time,
especially after you came in."
"It was you came in, wasn't it?"
"Her
mother's simply an absurd worldly old woman."
"My Lebyadkin distinguished
himself too."
"I kept looking at the ceiling to keep from laughing; the
ceiling there is finely painted."
His mother ought to be an abbess.
"I'm
afraid of her, though she did give me a black shawl."
"Of course, they
must all have come to strange conclusions about me."
"I wasn't vexed,
but I sat there, thinking what relation am I to them?"
"Of course, from
a countess one doesn't expect any but spiritual qualities; for the
domestic ones she's got plenty of footmen; and also a little worldly
coquetry, so as to be able to entertain foreign travellers."
"But yet that
Sunday they did look upon me as hopeless."
Only Dasha's an angel.
"I'm
awfully afraid they may wound _him_ by some careless allusion to me."""
"""Don't be afraid, and don't be uneasy,"" said Nikolay Vsyevolodovitch,
making a wry face."
"""However, that doesn't matter to me, if he is a little ashamed of me,
for there will always be more pity than shame, though it differs with
people, of course."
"He knows, to be sure, that I ought rather to pity
them than they me."""
"""You seem to be very much offended with them, Marya Timofyevna?"""
"""I?"
"Oh, no,"" she smiled with simple-hearted mirth."
"""Not at all."
"I looked
at you all, then."
"You were all angry, you were all quarrelling."
"They
meet together, and they don't know how to laugh from their hearts."
"So
much wealth and so little gaiety."
It all disgusts me.
"Though I feel for
no one now except myself."""
"""I've heard that you've had a hard life with your brother without me?"""
"""Who told you that?"
It's nonsense.
It's much worse now.
"Now my dreams
are not good, and my dreams are bad, because you've come."
"What have you
come for, I'd like to know."
"Tell me please?"""
"""Wouldn't you like to go back into the nunnery?"""
"""I knew they'd suggest the nunnery again."
"Your nunnery is a fine marvel
for me!"
And why should I go to it?
What should I go for now?
"I'm all
alone in the world now."
"It's too late for me to begin a third life."""
"""You seem very angry about something."
"Surely you're not afraid that I've
left off loving you?"""
"""I'm not troubling about you at all."
"I'm afraid that I may leave off
loving somebody."""
She laughed contemptuously.
"""I must have done him some great wrong,"" she added suddenly, as it were
to herself, ""only I don't know what I've done wrong; that's always what
troubles me."
"Always, always, for the last five years."
"I've been afraid
day and night that I've done him some wrong."
"I've prayed and prayed and
always thought of the great wrong I'd done him."
"And now it turns out it
was true."""
"""What's turned out?"""
"""I'm only afraid whether there's something on _his_ side,"" she went on,
not answering his question, not hearing it in fact."
"""And then, again, he
couldn't get on with such horrid people."
"The countess would have liked
to eat me, though she did make me sit in the carriage beside her."
They're all in the plot.
"Surely he's not betrayed me?"""
"(Her chin and
lips were twitching.)"
"""Tell me, have you read about Grishka Otrepyev,
how he was cursed in seven cathedrals?"""
Nikolay Vsyevolodovitch did not speak.
"""But I'll turn round now and look at you."""
"She seemed to decide
suddenly."
"""You turn to me, too, and look at me, but more attentively."
"I
want to make sure for the last time."""
"""I've been looking at you for a long time."""
"""H'm!"""
"said Marya Timofyevna, looking at him intently."
"""You've grown
much fatter."""
"She wanted to say something more, but suddenly, for the third time,
the same terror instantly distorted her face, and again she drew back,
putting her hand up before her."
"""What's the matter with you?"""
"cried Nikolay Vsyevolodovitch, almost
enraged."
"But her panic lasted only one instant, her face worked with a sort of
strange smile, suspicious and unpleasant."
"""I beg you, prince, get up and come in,"" she brought out suddenly, in a
firm, emphatic voice."
"""Come in?"
"Where am I to come in?"""
"""I've been fancying for five years how _he_ would come in."
"Get up and
go out of the door into the other room."
"I'll sit as though I weren't
expecting anything, and I'll take up a book, and suddenly you'll come in
after five years' travelling."
"I want to see what it will be like."""
"Nikolay Vsyevolodovitch ground his teeth, and muttered something to
himself."
"""Enough,"" he said, striking the table with his open hand."
"""I beg you to
listen to me, Marya Timofyevna."
"Do me the favour to concentrate all your
attention if you can."
"You're not altogether mad, you know!"""
"he broke out
impatiently."
"""Tomorrow I shall make our marriage public."
"You never will
live in a palace, get that out of your head."
"Do you want to live with
me for the rest of your life, only very far away from here?"
"In the
mountains in Switzerland, there's a place there.... Don't be afraid."
I'll never abandon you or put you in a madhouse.
"I shall have money
enough to live without asking anyone's help."
"You shall have a servant,
you shall do no work at all."
"Everything you want that's possible shall
be got for you."
"You shall pray, go where you like, and do what you like."
I won't touch you.
I won't go away from the place myself at all.
"If you
like, I won't speak to you all my life, or if you like, you can tell
me your stories every evening as you used to do in Petersburg in the
corners."
I'll read aloud to you if you like.
"But it must be all your
life in the same place, and that place is a gloomy one."
Will you?
"Are
you ready?"
"You won't regret it, torment me with tears and curses, will
you?"""
"She listened with extreme curiosity, and for a long time she was silent,
thinking."
"""It all seems incredible to me,"" she said at last, ironically and
disdainfully."
"""I might live for forty years in those mountains,"" she
laughed."
"""What of it?"
"Let's live forty years then..."" said Nikolay
Vsyevolodovitch, scowling."
"""H'm!"
"I won't come for anything."""
"""Not even with me?"""
"""And what are you that I should go with you?"
"I'm to sit on a mountain
beside him for forty years on end--a pretty story!"
"And upon my word,
how long-suffering people have become nowadays!"
"No, it cannot be that a
falcon has become an owl."
"My prince is not like that!"""
"she said, raising
her head proudly and triumphantly."
Light seemed to dawn upon him.
"""What makes you call me a prince, and... for whom do you take me?"""
"he
asked quickly."
"""Why, aren't you the prince?"""
"""I never have been one."""
"""So yourself, yourself, you tell me straight to my face that you're not
the prince?"""
"""I tell you I never have been."""
"""Good Lord!"""
"she cried, clasping her hands."
"""I was ready to expect
anything from _his_ enemies, but such insolence, never!"
"Is he alive?"""
"she
shrieked in a frenzy, turning upon Nikolay Vsyevolodovitch."
"""Have you
killed him?"
"Confess!"""
"""Whom do you take me for?"""
"he cried, jumping up from his chair with
a distorted face; but it was not easy now to frighten her."
"She was
triumphant."
"""Who can tell who you are and where you've sprung from?"
"Only my heart,
my heart had misgivings all these five years, of all the intrigues."
"And
I've been sitting here wondering what blind owl was making up to me?"
"No,
my dear, you're a poor actor, worse than Lebyadkin even."
"Give my humble
greetings to the countess and tell her to send someone better than you."
"Has she hired you, tell me?"
"Have they given you a place in her kitchen
out of charity?"
I see through your deception.
"I understand you all,
every one of you."""
He seized her firmly above the elbow; she laughed in his face.
"""You're like him, very like, perhaps you're a relation--you're a sly
lot!"
"Only mine is a bright falcon and a prince, and you're an owl, and
a shopman!"
"Mine will bow down to God if it pleases him, and won't if it
doesn't."
"And Shatushka (he's my dear, my darling!)"
"slapped you on the
cheeks, my Lebyadkin told me."
"And what were you afraid of then, when you
came in?"
Who had frightened you then?
"When I saw your mean face after
I'd fallen down and you picked me up--it was like a worm crawling into
my heart."
"It's not he, I thought, not _he!_ My falcon would never have
been ashamed of me before a fashionable young lady."
Oh heavens!
"That
alone kept me happy for those five years that my falcon was living
somewhere beyond the mountains, soaring, gazing at the sun.... Tell
me, you impostor, have you got much by it?"
"Did you need a big bribe to
consent?"
I wouldn't have given you a farthing.
Ha ha ha!
"Ha ha!..."""
"""Ugh, idiot!"""
"snarled Nikolay Vsyevolodovitch, still holding her tight
by the arm."
"""Go away, impostor!"""
she shouted peremptorily.
"""I'm the wife of my
prince; I'm not afraid of your knife!"""
"""Knife!"""
"""Yes, knife, you've a knife in your pocket."
"You thought I was asleep but
I saw it."
"When you came in just now you took out your knife!"""
"""What are you saying, unhappy creature?"
"What dreams you have!"""
"he
exclaimed, pushing her away from him with all his might, so that her
head and shoulders fell painfully against the sofa."
"He was rushing away;
but she at once flew to overtake him, limping and hopping, and though
Lebyadkin, panic-stricken, held her back with all his might, she
succeeded in shouting after him into the darkness, shrieking and
laughing:

""A curse on you, Grishka Otrepyev!"""
"IV

""A knife, a knife,"" he repeated with uncontrollable anger, striding
along through the mud and puddles, without picking his way."
"It is true
that at moments he had a terrible desire to laugh aloud frantically; but
for some reason he controlled himself and restrained his laughter."
"He
recovered himself only on the bridge, on the spot where Fedka had met
him that evening."
He found the man lying in wait for him again.
"Seeing
Nikolay Vsyevolodovitch he took off his cap, grinned gaily, and
began babbling briskly and merrily about something."
"At first Nikolay
Vsyevolodovitch walked on without stopping, and for some time did not
even listen to the tramp who was pestering him again."
"He was suddenly
struck by the thought that he had entirely forgotten him, and had
forgotten him at the very moment when he himself was repeating, ""A
knife, a knife."""
"He seized the tramp by the collar and gave vent to
his pent-up rage by flinging him violently against the bridge."
"For one
instant the man thought of fighting, but almost at once realising that
compared with his adversary, who had fallen upon him unawares, he was
no better than a wisp of straw, he subsided and was silent, without
offering any resistance."
"Crouching on the ground with his elbows crooked
behind his back, the wily tramp calmly waited for what would happen
next, apparently quite incredulous of danger."
"He was right in his
reckoning."
"Nikolay Vsyevolodovitch had already with his left hand taken
off his thick scarf to tie his prisoner's arms, but suddenly, for some
reason, he abandoned him, and shoved him away."
"The man instantly sprang
on to his feet, turned round, and a short, broad boot-knife suddenly
gleamed in his hand."
"""Away with that knife; put it away, at once!"""
"Nikolay Vsyevolodovitch
commanded with an impatient gesture, and the knife vanished as
instantaneously as it had appeared."
"Without speaking again or turning round, Nikolay Vsyevolodovitch went on
his way."
"But the persistent vagabond did not leave him even now, though
now, it is true, he did not chatter, and even respectfully kept his
distance, a full step behind."
"They crossed the bridge like this and came out on to the river bank,
turning this time to the left, again into a long deserted back street,
which led to the centre of the town by a shorter way than going through
Bogoyavlensky Street."
"""Is it true, as they say, that you robbed a church in the district the
other day?"""
Nikolay Vsyevolodovitch asked suddenly.
"""I went in to say my prayers in the first place,"" the tramp answered,
sedately and respectfully as though nothing had happened; more than
sedately, in fact, almost with dignity."
"There was no trace of his
former ""friendly"" familiarity."
"All that was to be seen was a serious,
business-like man, who had indeed been gratuitously insulted, but who
was capable of overlooking an insult."
"""But when the Lord led me there,"" he went on, ""ech, I thought what a
heavenly abundance!"
"It was all owing to my helpless state, as in our
way of life there's no doing without assistance."
"And, now, God be my
witness, sir, it was my own loss."
"The Lord punished me for my sins, and
what with the censer and the deacon's halter, I only got twelve roubles
altogether."
"The chin setting of St. Nikolay of pure silver went for next
to nothing."
"They said it was plated."""
"""You killed the watchman?"""
"""That is, I cleared the place out together with that watchman, but
afterwards, next morning, by the river, we fell to quarrelling which
should carry the sack."
"I sinned, I did lighten his load for him."""
"""Well, you can rob and murder again."""
"""That's the very advice Pyotr Stepanovitch gives me, in the very
same words, for he's uncommonly mean and hard-hearted about helping a
fellow-creature."
"And what's more, he hasn't a ha'p'orth of belief in the
Heavenly Creator, who made us out of earthly clay; but he says it's all
the work of nature even to the last beast."
"He doesn't understand either
that with our way of life it's impossible for us to get along without
friendly assistance."
"If you begin to talk to him he looks like a
sheep at the water; it makes one wonder."
"Would you believe, at Captain
Lebyadkin's, out yonder, whom your honour's just been visiting, when he
was living at Filipov's, before you came, the door stood open all night
long."
"He'd be drunk and sleeping like the dead, and his money dropping
out of his pockets all over the floor."
"I've chanced to see it with
my own eyes, for in our way of life it's impossible to live without
assistance....""

""How do you mean with your own eyes?"
"Did you go in at night then?"""
"""Maybe I did go in, but no one knows of it."""
"""Why didn't you kill him?"""
"""Reckoning it out, I steadied myself."
"For once having learned for sure
that I can always get one hundred and fifty roubles, why should I go so
far when I can get fifteen hundred roubles, if I only bide my time."
"For
Captain Lebyadkin (I've heard him with my own ears) had great hopes of
you when he was drunk; and there isn't a tavern here--not the lowest
pot-house--where he hasn't talked about it when he was in that state."
"So that hearing it from many lips, I began, too, to rest all my hopes
on your excellency."
"I speak to you, sir, as to my father, or my own
brother; for Pyotr Stepanovitch will never learn that from me, and not
a soul in the world."
"So won't your excellency spare me three roubles in
your kindness?"
"You might set my mind at rest, so that I might know the
real truth; for we can't get on without assistance."""
"Nikolay Vsyevolodovitch laughed aloud, and taking out his purse, in
which he had as much as fifty roubles, in small notes, threw him one
note out of the bundle, then a second, a third, a fourth."
"Fedka flew to
catch them in the air."
"The notes dropped into the mud, and he snatched
them up crying, ""Ech!"
"ech!"""
"Nikolay Vsyevolodovitch finished by flinging
the whole bundle at him, and, still laughing, went on down the street,
this time alone."
"The tramp remained crawling on his knees in the mud,
looking for the notes which were blown about by the wind and soaking in
the puddles, and for an hour after his spasmodic cries of ""Ech!"
"ech!"""
were still to be heard in the darkness.
CHAPTER III.
"THE DUEL


I

THE NEXT DAY, at two o'clock in the afternoon, the duel took place as
arranged."
"Things were hastened forward by Gaganov's obstinate desire to
fight at all costs."
"He did not understand his adversary's conduct,
and was in a fury."
"For a whole month he had been insulting him with
impunity, and had so far been unable to make him lose patience."
"What he
wanted was a challenge on the part of Nikolay Vsyevolodovitch, as he had
not himself any direct pretext for challenging him."
"His secret motive
for it, that is, his almost morbid hatred of Stavrogin for the insult to
his family four years before, he was for some reason ashamed to confess."
"And indeed he regarded this himself as an impossible pretext for a
challenge, especially in view of the humble apology offered by Nikolay
Stavrogin twice already."
"He privately made up his mind that Stavrogin
was a shameless coward; and could not understand how he could have
accepted Shatov's blow."
"So he made up his mind at last to send him
the extraordinarily rude letter that had finally roused Nikolay
Vsyevolodovitch himself to propose a meeting."
"Having dispatched this
letter the day before, he awaited a challenge with feverish impatience,
and while morbidly reckoning the chances at one moment with hope and
at the next with despair, he got ready for any emergency by securing a
second, to wit, Mavriky Nikolaevitch Drozdov, who was a friend of his,
an old schoolfellow, a man for whom he had a great respect."
"So when
Kirillov came next morning at nine o'clock with his message he found
things in readiness."
"All the apologies and unheard-of condescension of
Nikolay Vsyevolodovitch were at once, at the first word, rejected with
extraordinary exasperation."
"Mavriky Nikolaevitch, who had only been made
acquainted with the position of affairs the evening before, opened his
mouth with surprise at such incredible concessions, and would have urged
a reconciliation, but seeing that Gaganov, guessing his intention, was
almost trembling in his chair, refrained, and said nothing."
"If it had
not been for the promise given to his old schoolfellow he would have
retired immediately; he only remained in the hope of being some help on
the scene of action."
Kirillov repeated the challenge.
"All the conditions
of the encounter made by Stavrogin were accepted on the spot, without
the faintest objection."
"Only one addition was made, and that a ferocious
one."
"If the first shots had no decisive effect, they were to fire again,
and if the second encounter were inconclusive, it was to be followed by
a third."
"Kirillov frowned, objected to the third encounter, but gaining
nothing by his efforts agreed on the condition, however, that three
should be the limit, and that ""a fourth encounter was out of the
question."""
This was conceded.
"Accordingly at two o'clock in the
afternoon the meeting took place at Brykov, that is, in a little
copse in the outskirts of the town, lying between Skvoreshniki and the
Shpigulin factory."
"The rain of the previous night was over, but it was
damp, grey, and windy."
"Low, ragged, dingy clouds moved rapidly across
the cold sky."
"The tree-tops roared with a deep droning sound, and
creaked on their roots; it was a melancholy morning."
"Mavriky Nikolaevitch and Gaganov arrived on the spot in a smart
char-à-banc with a pair of horses driven by the latter."
"They were
accompanied by a groom."
"Nikolay Vsyevolodovitch and Kirillov arrived
almost at the same instant."
"They were not driving, they were on
horseback, and were also followed by a mounted servant."
"Kirillov, who
had never mounted a horse before, sat up boldly, erect in the saddle,
grasping in his right hand the heavy box of pistols which he would not
entrust to the servant."
"In his inexperience he was continually with his
left hand tugging at the reins, which made the horse toss his head and
show an inclination to rear."
"This, however, seemed to cause his rider no
uneasiness."
"Gaganov, who was morbidly suspicious and always ready to be
deeply offended, considered their coming on horseback as a fresh insult
to himself, inasmuch as it showed that his opponents were too confident
of success, since they had not even thought it necessary to have a
carriage in case of being wounded and disabled."
"He got out of his
char-à-banc, yellow with anger, and felt that his hands were trembling,
as he told Mavriky Nikolaevitch."
"He made no response at all to Nikolay
Vsyevolodovitch's bow, and turned away."
The seconds cast lots.
"The lot
fell on Kirillov's pistols."
"They measured out the barrier and placed the
combatants."
"The servants with the carriage and horses were moved
back three hundred paces."
"The weapons were loaded and handed to the
combatants."
"I'm sorry that I have to tell my story more quickly and have no time
for descriptions."
But I can't refrain from some comments.
"Mavriky
Nikolaevitch was melancholy and preoccupied."
"Kirillov, on the other
hand, was perfectly calm and unconcerned, very exact over the details
of the duties he had undertaken, but without the slightest fussiness or
even curiosity as to the issue of the fateful contest that was so near
at hand."
Nikolay Vsyevolodovitch was paler than usual.
"He was rather
lightly dressed in an overcoat and a white beaver hat."
"He seemed very
tired, he frowned from time to time, and seemed to feel it superfluous
to conceal his ill-humour."
"But Gaganov was at this moment more worthy
of mention than anyone, so that it is quite impossible not to say a few
words about him in particular."
"II

I have hitherto not had occasion to describe his appearance."
"He was a
tall man of thirty-three, and well fed, as the common folk express it,
almost fat, with lank flaxen hair, and with features which might be
called handsome."
"He had retired from the service with the rank of
colonel, and if he had served till he reached the rank of general he
would have been even more impressive in that position, and would very
likely have become an excellent fighting general."
"I must add, as characteristic of the man, that the chief cause of
his leaving the army was the thought of the family disgrace which had
haunted him so painfully since the insult paid to his father by Nikolay
Vsyevolodovitch four years before at the club."
"He conscientiously
considered it dishonourable to remain in the service, and was inwardly
persuaded that he was contaminating the regiment and his companions,
although they knew nothing of the incident."
"It's true that he had once
before been disposed to leave the army long before the insult to his
father, and on quite other grounds, but he had hesitated."
"Strange as it
is to write, the original design, or rather desire, to leave the army
was due to the proclamation of the 19th of February of the emancipation
of the serfs."
"Gaganov, who was one of the richest landowners in the
province, and who had not lost very much by the emancipation, and was,
moreover, quite capable of understanding the humanity of the reform and
its economic advantages, suddenly felt himself personally insulted by
the proclamation."
"It was something unconscious, a feeling; but was
all the stronger for being unrecognised."
"He could not bring himself,
however, to take any decisive step till his father's death."
"But he began
to be well known for his ""gentlemanly"" ideas to many persons of high
position in Petersburg, with whom he strenuously kept up connections."
"He
was secretive and self-contained."
"Another characteristic: he belonged to
that strange section of the nobility, still surviving in Russia, who
set an extreme value on their pure and ancient lineage, and take it too
seriously."
"At the same time he could not endure Russian history, and,
indeed, looked upon Russian customs in general as more or less piggish."
"Even in his childhood, in the special military school for the sons of
particularly wealthy and distinguished families in which he had the
privilege of being educated, from first to last certain poetic notions
were deeply rooted in his mind."
"He loved castles, chivalry; all the
theatrical part of it."
"He was ready to cry with shame that in the days
of the Moscow Tsars the sovereign had the right to inflict corporal
punishment on the Russian boyars, and blushed at the contrast."
"This
stiff and extremely severe man, who had a remarkable knowledge of
military science and performed his duties admirably, was at heart a
dreamer."
"It was said that he could speak at meetings and had the gift of
language, but at no time during the thirty-three years of his life had
he spoken."
"Even in the distinguished circles in Petersburg, in which
he had moved of late, he behaved with extraordinary haughtiness."
"His meeting in Petersburg with Nikolay Vsyevolodovitch, who had just
returned from abroad, almost sent him out of his mind."
"At the present
moment, standing at the barrier, he was terribly uneasy."
"He kept
imagining that the duel would somehow not come off; the least delay
threw him into a tremor."
"There was an expression of anguish in his face
when Kirillov, instead of giving the signal for them to fire, began
suddenly speaking, only for form, indeed, as he himself explained aloud."
"""Simply as a formality, now that you have the pistols in your hands,
and I must give the signal, I ask you for the last time, will you not be
reconciled?"
"It's the duty of a second."""
"As though to spite him, Mavriky Nikolaevitch, who had till then kept
silence, although he had been reproaching himself all day for his
compliance and acquiescence, suddenly caught up Kirillov's thought and
began to speak:

""I entirely agree with Mr. Kirillov's words...."
"This idea that
reconciliation is impossible at the barrier is a prejudice, only
suitable for Frenchmen."
"Besides, with your leave, I don't understand
what the offence is."
"I've been wanting to say so for a long time...
because every apology is offered, isn't it?"""
He flushed all over.
"He had rarely spoken so much, and with such
excitement."
"""I repeat again my offer to make every possible apology,"" Nikolay
Vsyevolodovitch interposed hurriedly."
"""This is impossible,"" shouted Gaganov furiously, addressing Mavriky
Nikolaevitch, and stamping with rage."
"""Explain to this man,"" he pointed
with his pistol at Nikolay Vsyevolodovitch, ""if you're my second and not
my enemy, Mavriky Nikolaevitch, that such overtures only aggravate the
insult."
He feels it impossible to be insulted by me!...
"He feels it no
disgrace to walk away from me at the barrier!"
"What does he take me for,
after that, do you think?..."
"And you, you, my second, too!"
"You're simply
irritating me that I may miss."""
He stamped again.
There were flecks of foam on his lips.
"""Negotiations are over."
"I beg you to listen to the signal!"""
"Kirillov
shouted at the top of his voice."
"""One!"
Two!
"Three!"""
"At the word ""Three"" the combatants took aim at one another."
"Gaganov at
once raised his pistol, and at the fifth or sixth step he fired."
"For a
second he stood still, and, making sure that he had missed, advanced to
the barrier."
"Nikolay Vsyevolodovitch advanced too, raising his pistol,
but somehow holding it very high, and fired, almost without taking aim."
"Then he took out his handkerchief and bound it round the little finger
of his right hand."
"Only then they saw that Gaganov had not missed him
completely, but the bullet had only grazed the fleshy part of his finger
without touching the bone; it was only a slight scratch."
"Kirillov at
once announced that the duel would go on, unless the combatants were
satisfied."
"""I declare,"" said Gaganov hoarsely (his throat felt parched), again
addressing Mavriky Nikolaevitch, ""that this man,"" again he pointed
in Stavrogin's direction, ""fired in the air on purpose...
intentionally...."
This is an insult again....
"He wants to make the
duel impossible!"""
"""I have the right to fire as I like so long as I keep the rules,""
Nikolay Vsyevolodovitch asserted resolutely."
"""No, he hasn't!"
Explain it to him!
"Explain it!"""
cried Gaganov.
"""I'm in complete agreement with Nikolay Vsyevolodovitch,"" proclaimed
Kirillov."
"""Why does he spare me?"""
"Gaganov raged, not hearing him."
"""I despise his
mercy...."
I spit on it....
"I...""

""I give you my word that I did not intend to insult you,"" cried Nikolay
Vsyevolodovitch impatiently."
"""I shot high because I don't want to kill
anyone else, either you or anyone else."
"It's nothing to do with you
personally."
"It's true that I don't consider myself insulted, and I'm
sorry that angers you."
"But I don't allow any one to interfere with my
rights."""
"""If he's so afraid of bloodshed, ask him why he challenged me,"" yelled
Gaganov, still addressing Mavriky Nikolaevitch."
"""How could he help challenging you?"""
"said Kirillov, intervening."
"""You
wouldn't listen to anything."
"How was one to get rid of you?"""
"""I'll only mention one thing,"" observed Mavriky Nikolaevitch, pondering
the matter with painful effort."
"""If a combatant declares beforehand that
he will fire in the air the duel certainly cannot go on... for obvious
and... delicate reasons."""
"""I haven't declared that I'll fire in the air every time,"" cried
Stavrogin, losing all patience."
"""You don't know what's in my mind or how
I intend to fire again...."
"I'm not restricting the duel at all."""
"""In that case the encounter can go on,"" said Mavriky Nikolaevitch to
Gaganov."
"""Gentlemen, take your places,"" Kirillov commanded."
"Again they advanced,
again Gaganov missed and Stavrogin fired into the air."
"There might have
been a dispute as to his firing into the air."
"Nikolay Vsyevolodovitch
might have flatly declared that he'd fired properly, if he had not
admitted that he had missed intentionally."
"He did not aim straight at
the sky or at the trees, but seemed to aim at his adversary, though as
he pointed the pistol the bullet flew a yard above his hat."
"The second
time the shot was even lower, even less like an intentional miss."
Nothing would have convinced Gaganov now.
"""Again!"""
"he muttered, grinding his teeth."
"""No matter!"
"I've been
challenged and I'll make use of my rights."
"I'll fire a third time...
whatever happens."""
"""You have full right to do so,"" Kirillov rapped out."
"Mavriky
Nikolaevitch said nothing."
"The opponents were placed a third time, the
signal was given."
"This time Gaganov went right up to the barrier, and
began from there taking aim, at a distance of twelve paces."
"His hand
was trembling too much to take good aim."
"Stavrogin stood with his pistol
lowered and awaited his shot without moving."
"""Too long; you've been aiming too long!"""
Kirillov shouted impetuously.
"""Fire!"
"Fire!"""
"But the shot rang out, and this time Stavrogin's white beaver hat flew
off."
The aim had been fairly correct.
"The crown of the hat was pierced
very low down; a quarter of an inch lower and all would have been over."
Kirillov picked up the hat and handed it to Nikolay Vsyevolodovitch.
"""Fire; don't detain your adversary!"""
"cried Mavriky Nikolaevitch in
extreme agitation, seeing that Stavrogin seemed to have forgotten to
fire, and was examining the hat with Kirillov."
"Stavrogin started, looked
at Gaganov, turned round and this time, without the slightest regard for
punctilio, fired to one side, into the copse."
The duel was over.
"Gaganov
stood as though overwhelmed."
"Mavriky Nikolaevitch went up and began
saying something to him, but he did not seem to understand."
"Kirillov
took off his hat as he went away, and nodded to Mavriky Nikolaevitch."
But Stavrogin forgot his former politeness.
"When he had shot into the
copse he did not even turn towards the barrier."
"He handed his pistol to
Kirillov and hastened towards the horses."
"His face looked angry; he did
not speak."
"Kirillov, too, was silent."
"They got on their horses and set
off at a gallop."
"III

""Why don't you speak?"""
"he called impatiently to Kirillov, when they were
not far from home."
"""What do you want?"""
"replied the latter, almost slipping off his horse,
which was rearing."
Stavrogin restrained himself.
"""I didn't mean to insult that... fool, and I've insulted him again,"" he
said quietly."
"""Yes, you've insulted him again,"" Kirillov jerked out, ""and besides,
he's not a fool."""
"""I've done all I can, anyway."""
"""No."""
"""What ought I to have done?"""
"""Not have challenged him."""
"""Accept another blow in the face?"""
"""Yes, accept another."""
"""I can't understand anything now,"" said Stavrogin wrathfully."
"""Why does
every one expect of me something not expected from anyone else?"
"Why am
I to put up with what no one else puts up with, and undertake burdens no
one else can bear?"""
"""I thought you were seeking a burden yourself."""
"""I seek a burden?"""
"""Yes."""
"""You've... seen that?"""
"""Yes."""
"""Is it so noticeable?"""
"""Yes."""
There was silence for a moment.
Stavrogin had a very preoccupied face.
He was almost impressed.
"""I didn't aim because I didn't want to kill anyone."
"There was nothing
more in it, I assure you,"" he said hurriedly, and with agitation, as
though justifying himself."
"""You ought not to have offended him."""
"""What ought I to have done then?"""
"""You ought to have killed him."""
"""Are you sorry I didn't kill him?"""
"""I'm not sorry for anything."
I thought you really meant to kill him.
"You
don't know what you're seeking."""
"""I seek a burden,"" laughed Stavrogin."
"""If you didn't want blood yourself, why did you give him a chance to
kill you?"""
"""If I hadn't challenged him, he'd have killed me simply, without a
duel."""
"""That's not your affair."
"Perhaps he wouldn't have killed you."""
"""Only have beaten me?"""
"""That's not your business."
Bear your burden.
"Or else there's no merit."""
"""Hang your merit."
"I don't seek anyone's approbation."""
"""I thought you were seeking it,"" Kirillov commented with terrible
unconcern."
They rode into the courtyard of the house.
"""Do you care to come in?"""
said Nikolay Vsyevolodovitch.
"""No; I'm going home."
"Good-bye."""
He got off the horse and took his box of pistols under his arm.
"""Anyway, you're not angry with me?"""
"said Stavrogin, holding out his hand
to him."
"""Not in the least,"" said Kirillov, turning round to shake hands with
him."
"""If my burden's light it's because it's from nature; perhaps your
burden's heavier because that's your nature."
"There's no need to be much
ashamed; only a little."""
"""I know I'm a worthless character, and I don't pretend to be a strong
one."""
"""You'd better not; you're not a strong person."
"Come and have tea."""
"Nikolay Vsyevolodovitch went into the house, greatly perturbed."
"IV

He learned at once from Alexey Yegorytch that Varvara Petrovna had
been very glad to hear that Nikolay Vsyevolodovitch had gone out for a
ride--the first time he had left the house after eight days' illness."
"She had ordered the carriage, and had driven out alone for a breath of
fresh air ""according to the habit of the past, as she had forgotten for
the last eight days what it meant to breathe fresh air."""
"""Alone, or with Darya Pavlovna?"""
"Nikolay Vsyevolodovitch interrupted the
old man with a rapid question, and he scowled when he heard that Darya
Pavlovna ""had declined to go abroad on account of indisposition and was
in her rooms."""
"""Listen, old man,"" he said, as though suddenly making up his mind."
"""Keep
watch over her all to-day, and if you notice her coming to me, stop her
at once, and tell her that I can't see her for a few days at least...
that I ask her not to come myself...."
"I'll let her know myself, when the
time comes."
"Do you hear?"""
"""I'll tell her, sir,"" said Alexey Yegorytch, with distress in his voice,
dropping his eyes."
"""Not till you see clearly she's meaning to come and see me of herself,
though."""
"""Don't be afraid, sir, there shall be no mistake."
"Your interviews have
all passed through me, hitherto."
"You've always turned to me for help."""
"""I know."
"Not till she comes of herself, anyway."
"Bring me some tea, if
you can, at once."""
"The old man had hardly gone out, when almost at the same instant the
door reopened, and Darya Pavlovna appeared in the doorway."
"Her eyes were
tranquil, though her face was pale."
"""Where have you come from?"""
exclaimed Stavrogin.
"""I was standing there, and waiting for him to go out, to come in to
you."
"I heard the order you gave him, and when he came out just now I hid
round the corner, on the right, and he didn't notice me."""
"""I've long meant to break off with you, Dasha... for a while... for the
present."
"I couldn't see you last night, in spite of your note."
"I meant
to write to you myself, but I don't know how to write,"" he added with
vexation, almost as though with disgust."
"""I thought myself that we must break it off."
"Varvara Petrovna is too
suspicious of our relations."""
"""Well, let her be."""
"""She mustn't be worried."
"So now we part till the end comes."""
"""You still insist on expecting the end?"""
"""Yes, I'm sure of it."""
"""But nothing in the world ever has an end."""
"""This will have an end."
Then call me.
I'll come.
"Now, good-bye."""
"""And what sort of end will it be?"""
smiled Nikolay Vsyevolodovitch.
"""You're not wounded, and... have not shed blood?"""
"she asked, not
answering his question."
"""It was stupid."
I didn't kill anyone.
Don't be uneasy.
"However, you'll
hear all about it to-day from every one."
"I'm not quite well."""
"""I'm going."
"The announcement of the marriage won't be to-day?"""
"she added
irresolutely."
"""It won't be to-day, and it won't be to-morrow."
"I can't say about the
day after to-morrow."
"Perhaps we shall all be dead, and so much the
better."
"Leave me alone, leave me alone, do."""
"""You won't ruin that other... mad girl?"""
"""I won't ruin either of the mad creatures."
"It seems to be the sane I'm
ruining."
"I'm so vile and loathsome, Dasha, that I might really send for
you, 'at the latter end,' as you say."
"And in spite of your sanity you'll
come."
"Why will you be your own ruin?"""
"""I know that at the end I shall be the only one left you, and..."
"I'm
waiting for that."""
"""And what if I don't send for you after all, but run away from you?"""
"""That can't be."
"You will send for me."""
"""There's a great deal of contempt for me in that."""
"""You know that there's not only contempt."""
"""Then there is contempt, anyway?"""
"""I used the wrong word."
"God is my witness, it's my greatest wish that
you may never have need of me."""
"""One phrase is as good as another."
"I should also have wished not to have
ruined you."""
"""You can never, anyhow, be my ruin; and you know that yourself, better
than anyone,"" Darya Pavlovna said, rapidly and resolutely."
"""If I don't
come to you I shall be a sister of mercy, a nurse, shall wait upon the
sick, or go selling the gospel."
I've made up my mind to that.
"I cannot
be anyone's wife."
"I can't live in a house like this, either."
"That's not
what I want.... You know all that."""
"""No, I never could tell what you want."
"It seems to me that you're
interested in me, as some veteran nurses get specially interested in
some particular invalid in comparison with the others, or still more,
like some pious old women who frequent funerals and find one corpse more
attractive than another."
"Why do you look at me so strangely?"""
"""Are you very ill?"""
"she asked sympathetically, looking at him in a
peculiar way."
"""Good heavens!"
"And this man wants to do without me!"""
"""Listen, Dasha, now I'm always seeing phantoms."
"One devil offered me
yesterday, on the bridge, to murder Lebyadkin and Marya Timofyevna, to
settle the marriage difficulty, and to cover up all traces."
"He asked me
to give him three roubles on account, but gave me to understand that
the whole operation wouldn't cost less than fifteen hundred."
"Wasn't he a
calculating devil!"
A regular shopkeeper.
"Ha ha!"""
"""But you're fully convinced that it was an hallucination?"""
"""Oh, no; not a bit an hallucination!"
"It was simply Fedka the convict,
the robber who escaped from prison."
But that's not the point.
"What do
you suppose I did!"
"I gave him all I had, everything in my purse, and now
he's sure I've given him that on account!"""
"""You met him at night, and he made such a suggestion?"
"Surely you must
see that you're being caught in their nets on every side!"""
"""Well, let them be."
"But you've got some question at the tip of your
tongue, you know."
"I see it by your eyes,"" he added with a resentful and
irritable smile."
Dasha was frightened.
"""I've no question at all, and no doubt whatever; you'd better be quiet!"""
"she cried in dismay, as though waving off his question."
"""Then you're convinced that I won't go to Fedka's little shop?"""
"""Oh, God!"""
"she cried, clasping her hands."
"""Why do you torture me like
this?"""
"""Oh, forgive me my stupid joke."
"I must be picking up bad manners from
them."
"Do you know, ever since last night I feel awfully inclined to
laugh, to go on laughing continually forever so long."
"It's as though
I must explode with laughter."
It's like an illness.... Oh!
"my mother's
coming in."
"I always know by the rumble when her carriage has stopped at
the entrance."""
Dasha seized his hand.
"""God save you from your demon, and... call me, call me quickly!"""
"""Oh!"
a fine demon!
"It's simply a little nasty, scrofulous imp, with a
cold in his head, one of the unsuccessful ones."
"But you have something
you don't dare to say again, Dasha?"""
"She looked at him with pain and reproach, and turned towards the door."
"""Listen,"" he called after her, with a malignant and distorted smile."
"""If..."
"Yes, if, in one word, if... you understand, even if I did go to
that little shop, and if I called you after that--would you come then?"""
"She went out, hiding her face in her hands, and neither turning nor
answering."
"""She will come even after the shop,"" he whispered, thinking a moment,
and an expression of scornful disdain came into his face."
"""A nurse!"
H'm!...
"but perhaps that's what I want."""
CHAPTER IV.
"ALL IN EXPECTATION


I

The impression made on the whole neighbourhood by the story of the duel,
which was rapidly noised abroad, was particularly remarkable from the
unanimity with which every one hastened to take up the cudgels for
Nikolay Vsyevolodovitch."
"Many of his former enemies declared themselves
his friends."
"The chief reason for this change of front in public opinion
was chiefly due to one person, who had hitherto not expressed her
opinion, but who now very distinctly uttered a few words, which at
once gave the event a significance exceedingly interesting to the vast
majority."
This was how it happened.
"On the day after the duel, all the
town was assembled at the Marshal of Nobility's in honour of his wife's
nameday."
"Yulia Mihailovna was present, or, rather, presided, accompanied
by Lizaveta Nikolaevna, radiant with beauty and peculiar gaiety, which
struck many of our ladies at once as particularly suspicious at
this time."
"And I may mention, by the way, her engagement to Mavriky
Nikolaevitch was by now an established fact."
"To a playful question from
a retired general of much consequence, of whom we shall have more to
say later, Lizaveta Nikolaevna frankly replied that evening that she was
engaged."
"And only imagine, not one of our ladies would believe in her
engagement."
"They all persisted in assuming a romance of some sort, some
fatal family secret, something that had happened in Switzerland, and for
some reason imagined that Yulia Mihailovna must have had some hand in
it."
"It was difficult to understand why these rumours, or rather fancies,
persisted so obstinately, and why Yulia Mihailovna was so positively
connected with it."
"As soon as she came in, all turned to her with
strange looks, brimful of expectation."
"It must be observed that owing to
the freshness of the event, and certain circumstances accompanying
it, at the party people talked of it with some circumspection, in
undertones."
"Besides, nothing yet was known of the line taken by the
authorities."
"As far as was known, neither of the combatants had been
troubled by the police."
"Every one knew, for instance, that Gaganov had
set off home early in the morning to Duhovo, without being hindered."
"Meanwhile, of course, all were eager for someone to be the first to
speak of it aloud, and so to open the door to the general impatience."
"They rested their hopes on the general above-mentioned, and they were
not disappointed."
"This general, a landowner, though not a wealthy one, was one of the most
imposing members of our club, and a man of an absolutely unique turn of
mind."
"He flirted in the old-fashioned way with the young ladies, and was
particularly fond, in large assemblies, of speaking aloud with all the
weightiness of a general, on subjects to which others were alluding
in discreet whispers."
"This was, so to say, his special rôle in local
society."
"He drawled, too, and spoke with peculiar suavity, probably
having picked up the habit from Russians travelling abroad, or from
those wealthy landowners of former days who had suffered most from the
emancipation."
"Stepan Trofimovitch had observed that the more completely
a landowner was ruined, the more suavely he lisped and drawled his
words."
"He did, as a fact, lisp and drawl himself, but was not aware of
it in himself."
The general spoke like a person of authority.
"He was, besides, a distant
relation of Gaganov's, though he was on bad terms with him, and even
engaged in litigation with him."
"He had, moreover, in the past, fought
two duels himself, and had even been degraded to the ranks and sent to
the Caucasus on account of one of them."
"Some mention was made of Varvara
Petrovna's having driven out that day and the day before, after being
kept indoors ""by illness,"" though the allusion was not to her, but to
the marvellous matching of her four grey horses of the Stavrogins'
own breeding."
"The general suddenly observed that he had met ""young
Stavrogin"" that day, on horseback.... Every one was instantly silent."
"The general munched his lips, and suddenly proclaimed, twisting in his
fingers his presentation gold snuff-box."
"""I'm sorry I wasn't here some years ago..."
"I mean when I was at
Carlsbad... H'm!"
"I'm very much interested in that young man about whom
I heard so many rumours at that time."
H'm!
"And, I say, is it true that
he's mad?"
Some one told me so then.
"Suddenly I'm told that he has been
insulted by some student here, in the presence of his cousins, and he
slipped under the table to get away from him."
"And yesterday I heard
from Stepan Vysotsky that Stavrogin had been fighting with Gaganov."
"And
simply with the gallant object of offering himself as a target to an
infuriated man, just to get rid of him."
H'm!
"Quite in the style of the
guards of the twenties."
"Is there any house where he visits here?"""
The general paused as though expecting an answer.
"A way had been opened
for the public impatience to express itself."
"""What could be simpler?"""
"cried Yulia Mihailovna, raising her voice,
irritated that all present had turned their eyes upon her, as though
at a word of command."
"""Can one wonder that Stavrogin fought Gaganov and
took no notice of the student?"
"He couldn't challenge a man who used to
be his serf!"""
A noteworthy saying!
"A clear and simple notion, yet it had entered
nobody's head till that moment."
"It was a saying that had extraordinary
consequences."
"All scandal and gossip, all the petty tittle-tattle was
thrown into the background, another significance had been detected."
"A
new character was revealed whom all had misjudged; a character, almost
ideally severe in his standards."
"Mortally insulted by a student, that
is, an educated man, no longer a serf, he despised the affront because
his assailant had once been his serf."
"Society had gossiped and slandered
him; shallow-minded people had looked with contempt on a man who had
been struck in the face."
"He had despised a public opinion, which had not
risen to the level of the highest standards, though it discussed them."
"""And, meantime, you and I, Ivan Alexandrovitch, sit and discuss the
correct standards,"" one old club member observed to another, with a warm
and generous glow of self-reproach."
"""Yes, Pyotr Mihailovitch, yes,"" the other chimed in with zest, ""talk of
the younger generation!"""
"""It's not a question of the younger generation,"" observed a third,
putting in his spoke, ""it's nothing to do with the younger generation;
he's a star, not one of the younger generation; that's the way to look
at it."""
"""And it's just that sort we need; they're rare people."""
"The chief
point in all this was that the ""new man,"" besides showing himself an
unmistakable nobleman, was the wealthiest landowner in the province, and
was, therefore, bound to be a leading man who could be of assistance."
"I've already alluded in passing to the attitude of the landowners of our
province."
"People were enthusiastic:

""He didn't merely refrain from challenging the student."
"He put his hands
behind him, note that particularly, your excellency,"" somebody pointed
out."
"""And he didn't haul him up before the new law-courts, either,"" added
another."
"""In spite of the fact that for a personal insult to a nobleman he'd have
got fifteen roubles damages!"
"He he he!"""
"""No, I'll tell you a secret about the new courts,"" cried a third, in
a frenzy of excitement, ""if anyone's caught robbing or swindling and
convicted, he'd better run home while there's yet time, and murder his
mother."
"He'll be acquitted of everything at once, and ladies will wave
their batiste handkerchiefs from the platform."
"It's the absolute truth!"""
"""It's the truth."
"It's the truth!"""
"The inevitable anecdotes followed: Nikolay Vsyevolodovitch's friendly
relations with Count K. were recalled."
"Count K.'s stern and independent
attitude to recent reforms was well known, as well as his remarkable
public activity, though that had somewhat fallen off of late."
"And
now, suddenly, every one was positive that Nikolay Vsyevolodovitch was
betrothed to one of the count's daughters, though nothing had given
grounds for such a supposition."
"And as for some wonderful adventures in
Switzerland with Lizaveta Nikolaevna, even the ladies quite dropped all
reference to it."
"I must mention, by the way, that the Drozdovs had by
this time succeeded in paying all the visits they had omitted at first."
"Every one now confidently considered Lizaveta Nikolaevna a most ordinary
girl, who paraded her delicate nerves."
"Her fainting on the day of
Nikolay Vsyevolodovitch's arrival was explained now as due to her
terror at the student's outrageous behaviour."
"They even increased the
prosaicness of that to which before they had striven to give such a
fantastic colour."
"As for a lame woman who had been talked of, she was
forgotten completely."
They were ashamed to remember her.
"""And if there had been a hundred lame girls--we've all been young once!"""
"Nikolay Vsyevolodovitch's respectfulness to his mother was enlarged
upon."
Various virtues were discovered in him.
"People talked with
approbation of the learning he had acquired in the four years he had
spent in German universities."
"Gaganov's conduct was declared utterly
tactless: ""not knowing friend from foe."""
"Yulia Mihailovna's keen insight
was unhesitatingly admitted."
"So by the time Nikolay Vsyevolodovitch made his appearance among them
he was received by every one with naïve solemnity."
"In all eyes fastened
upon him could be read eager anticipation."
"Nikolay Vsyevolodovitch at
once wrapped himself in the most austere silence, which, of course,
gratified every one much more than if he had talked till doomsday."
"In a
word, he was a success, he was the fashion."
"If once one has figured in
provincial society, there's no retreating into the background."
"Nikolay
Vsyevolodovitch began to fulfil all his social duties in the province
punctiliously as before."
"He was not found cheerful company: ""a man who
has seen suffering; a man not like other people; he has something to be
melancholy about."""
"Even the pride and disdainful aloofness for which he
had been so detested four years before was now liked and respected."
Varvara Petrovna was triumphant.
"I don't know whether she grieved much
over the shattering of her dreams concerning Lizaveta Nikolaevna."
"Family
pride, of course, helped her to get over it."
"One thing was strange:
Varvara Petrovna was suddenly convinced that Nikolay Vsyevolodovitch
really had ""made his choice"" at Count K.'s."
"And what was strangest of
all, she was led to believe it by rumours which reached her on no
better authority than other people."
"She was afraid to ask Nikolay
Vsyevolodovitch a direct question."
"Two or three times, however, she
could not refrain from slyly and good-humouredly reproaching him for not
being open with her."
Nikolay Vsyevolodovitch smiled and remained silent.
The silence was taken as a sign of assent.
"And yet, all the time she
never forgot the cripple."
"The thought of her lay like a stone on her
heart, a nightmare, she was tortured by strange misgivings and surmises,
and all this at the same time as she dreamed of Count K.'s daughters."
But of this we shall speak later.
"Varvara Petrovna began again, of
course, to be treated with extreme deference and respect in society, but
she took little advantage of it and went out rarely."
"She did, however, pay a visit of ceremony to the governor's wife."
"Of
course, no one had been more charmed and delighted by Yulia Mihailovna's
words spoken at the marshal's soirée than she."
"They lifted a load of
care off her heart, and had at once relieved much of the distress she
had been suffering since that luckless Sunday."
"""I misunderstood that woman,"" she declared, and with her characteristic
impulsiveness she frankly told Yulia Mihailovna that she had come to
_thank her_."
"Yulia Mihailovna was flattered, but she behaved with dignity."
"She was beginning about this time to be very conscious of her own
importance, too much so, in fact."
"She announced, for example, in the
course of conversation, that she had never heard of Stepan Trofimovitch
as a leading man or a savant."
"""I know young Verhovensky, of course, and make much of him."
"He's
imprudent, but then he's young; he's thoroughly well-informed, though."
"He's not an out-of-date, old-fashioned critic, anyway."""
"Varvara Petrovna
hastened to observe that Stepan Trofimovitch had never been a critic,
but had, on the contrary, spent all his life in her house."
"He was
renowned through circumstances of his early career, ""only too well known
to the whole world,"" and of late for his researches in Spanish
history."
"Now he intended to write also on the position of modern German
universities, and, she believed, something about the Dresden Madonna
too."
"In short, Varvara Petrovna refused to surrender Stepan Trofimovitch
to the tender mercies of Yulia Mihailovna."
"""The Dresden Madonna?"
You mean the Sistine Madonna?
"_Chère_ Varvara
Petrovna, I spent two hours sitting before that picture and came away
utterly disillusioned."
"I could make nothing of it and was in complete
amazement."
"Karmazinov, too, says it's hard to understand it."
"They all
see nothing in it now, Russians and English alike."
"All its fame is just
the talk of the last generation."""
"""Fashions are changed then?"""
"""What I think is that one mustn't despise our younger generation either."
"They cry out that they're communists, but what I say is that we must
appreciate them and mustn't be hard on them."
"I read everything now--the
papers, communism, the natural sciences--I get everything because, after
all, one must know where one's living and with whom one has to do."
"One
mustn't spend one's whole life on the heights of one's own fancy."
"I've
come to the conclusion, and adopted it as a principle, that one must be
kind to the young people and so keep them from the brink."
"Believe me,
Varvara Petrovna, that none but we who make up good society can by our
kindness and good influence keep them from the abyss towards which they
are brought by the intolerance of all these old men."
"I am glad though to
learn from you about Stepan Trofimovitch."
"You suggest an idea to me:
he may be useful at our literary matinée, you know I'm arranging for a
whole day of festivities, a subscription entertainment for the benefit
of the poor governesses of our province."
"They are scattered about
Russia; in our district alone we can reckon up six of them."
"Besides
that, there are two girls in the telegraph office, two are being trained
in the academy, the rest would like to be but have not the means."
"The
Russian woman's fate is a terrible one, Varvara Petrovna!"
"It's out of
that they're making the university question now, and there's even been a
meeting of the Imperial Council about it."
"In this strange Russia of ours
one can do anything one likes; and that, again, is why it's only by the
kindness and the direct warm sympathy of all the better classes that we
can direct this great common cause in the true path."
"Oh, heavens, have
we many noble personalities among us!"
"There are some, of course, but
they are scattered far and wide."
Let us unite and we shall be stronger.
"In one word, I shall first have a literary matinée, then a light
luncheon, then an interval, and in the evening a ball."
"We meant to begin
the evening by living pictures, but it would involve a great deal
of expense, and so, to please the public, there will be one or two
quadrilles in masks and fancy dresses, representing well-known literary
schools."
This humorous idea was suggested by Karmazinov.
"He has been a
great help to me."
"Do you know he's going to read us the last thing he's
written, which no one has seen yet."
"He is laying down the pen, and will
write no more."
This last essay is his farewell to the public.
"It's a
charming little thing called 'Merci.'"
"The title is French; he thinks
that more amusing and even subtler."
"I do, too."
In fact I advised it.
"I
think Stepan Trofimovitch might read us something too, if it were quite
short and... not so very learned."
"I believe Pyotr Stepanovitch and some
one else too will read something."
"Pyotr Stepanovitch shall run round
to you and tell you the programme."
"Better still, let me bring it to you
myself."""
"""Allow me to put my name down in your subscription list too."
"I'll tell
Stepan Trofimovitch and will beg him to consent."""
Varvara Petrovna returned home completely fascinated.
"She was ready
to stand up for Yulia Mihailovna through thick and thin, and for some
reason was already quite put out with Stepan Trofimovitch, while he,
poor man, sat at home, all unconscious."
"""I'm in love with her."
"I can't understand how I could be so mistaken in
that woman,"" she said to Nikolay Vsyevolodovitch and Pyotr Stepanovitch,
who dropped in that evening."
"""But you must make peace with the old man all the same,"" Pyotr
Stepanovitch submitted."
"""He's in despair."
"You've quite sent him to
Coventry."
"Yesterday he met your carriage and bowed, and you turned away."
"We'll trot him out, you know; I'm reckoning on him for something, and he
may still be useful."""
"""Oh, he'll read something."""
"""I don't mean only that."
And I was meaning to drop in on him to-day.
"So
shall I tell him?"""
"""If you like."
"I don't know, though, how you'll arrange it,"" she said
irresolutely."
"""I was meaning to have a talk with him myself, and wanted
to fix the time and place."""
She frowned.
"""Oh, it's not worth while fixing a time."
"I'll simply give him the
message."""
"""Very well, do."
Add that I certainly will fix a time to see him though.
"Be sure to say that too."""
"Pyotr Stepanovitch ran off, grinning."
"He was, in fact, to the best of
my recollection, particularly spiteful all this time, and ventured upon
extremely impatient sallies with almost every one."
"Strange to say, every
one, somehow, forgave him."
"It was generally accepted that he was not to
be looked at from the ordinary standpoint."
"I may remark that he took up
an extremely resentful attitude about Nikolay Vsyevolodovitch's duel."
It took him unawares.
He turned positively green when he was told of it.
"Perhaps his vanity was wounded: he only heard of it next day when every
one knew of it."
"""You had no right to fight, you know,"" he whispered to Stavrogin, five
days later, when he chanced to meet him at the club."
"It was remarkable
that they had not once met during those five days, though Pyotr
Stepanovitch had dropped in at Varvara Petrovna's almost every day."
"Nikolay Vsyevolodovitch looked at him in silence with an absent-minded
air, as though not understanding what was the matter, and he went on
without stopping."
"He was crossing the big hall of the club on his way to
the refreshment room."
"""You've been to see Shatov too.... You mean to make it known about Marya
Timofyevna,"" Pyotr Stepanovitch muttered, running after him, and, as
though not thinking of what he was doing he clutched at his shoulder."
"Nikolay Vsyevolodovitch shook his hand off and turned round quickly
to him with a menacing scowl."
"Pyotr Stepanovitch looked at him with
a strange, prolonged smile."
It all lasted only one moment.
"Nikolay
Vsyevolodovitch walked on."
"II

He went to the ""old man"" straight from Varvara Petrovna's, and he was
in such haste simply from spite, that he might revenge himself for an
insult of which I had no idea at that time."
"The fact is that at
their last interview on the Thursday of the previous week, Stepan
Trofimovitch, though the dispute was one of his own beginning, had
ended by turning Pyotr Stepanovitch out with his stick."
"He concealed the
incident from me at the time."
"But now, as soon as Pyotr Stepanovitch ran
in with his everlasting grin, which was so naïvely condescending, and
his unpleasantly inquisitive eyes peering into every corner, Stepan
Trofimovitch at once made a signal aside to me, not to leave the room."
"This was how their real relations came to be exposed before me, for on
this occasion I heard their whole conversation."
Stepan Trofimovitch was sitting stretched out on a lounge.
"He had grown
thin and sallow since that Thursday."
"Pyotr Stepanovitch seated himself
beside him with a most familiar air, unceremoniously tucking his legs up
under him, and taking up more room on the lounge than deference to his
father should have allowed."
"Stepan Trofimovitch moved aside, in silence,
and with dignity."
On the table lay an open book.
"It was the novel, ""What's to be done?"""
"Alas, I must confess one strange weakness in my friend; the fantasy that
he ought to come forth from his solitude and fight a last battle was
getting more and more hold upon his deluded imagination."
"I guessed that
he had got the novel and was _studying_ it solely in order that when the
inevitable conflict with the ""shriekers"" came about he might know their
methods and arguments beforehand, from their very ""catechism,"" and in
that way be prepared to confute them all triumphantly, _before her eyes._
Oh, how that book tortured him!"
"He sometimes flung it aside in despair,
and leaping up, paced about the room almost in a frenzy."
"""I agree that the author's fundamental idea is a true one,"" he said to
me feverishly, ""but that only makes it more awful."
"It's just our idea,
exactly ours; we first sowed the seed, nurtured it, prepared the way,
and, indeed, what could they say new, after us?"
"But, heavens!"
"How it's
all expressed, distorted, mutilated!"""
"he exclaimed, tapping the book
with his fingers."
"""Were these the conclusions we were striving for?"
"Who
can understand the original idea in this?"""
"""Improving your mind?"""
"sniggered Pyotr Stepanovitch, taking the book
from the table and reading the title."
"""It's high time."
"I'll bring you
better, if you like."""
Stepan Trofimovitch again preserved a dignified silence.
"I was sitting
on a sofa in the corner."
Pyotr Stepanovitch quickly explained the reason of his coming.
"Of
course, Stepan Trofimovitch was absolutely staggered, and he listened in
alarm, which was mixed with extreme indignation."
"""And that Yulia Mihailovna counts on my coming to read for her!"""
"""Well, they're by no means in such need of you."
"On the contrary, it's by
way of an attention to you, so as to make up to Varvara Petrovna."
"But,
of course, you won't dare to refuse, and I expect you want to yourself,""
he added with a grin."
"""You old fogies are all so devilishly ambitious."
"But, I say though, you must look out that it's not too boring."
"What have
you got?"
"Spanish history, or what is it?"
"You'd better let me look at it
three days beforehand, or else you'll put us to sleep perhaps."""
"The hurried and too barefaced coarseness of these thrusts was obviously
premeditated."
"He affected to behave as though it were impossible to talk
to Stepan Trofimovitch in different and more delicate language."
"Stepan
Trofimovitch resolutely persisted in ignoring his insults, but what his
son told him made a more and more overwhelming impression upon him."
"""And she, she herself sent me this message through you?"""
"he asked,
turning pale."
"""Well, you see, she means to fix a time and place for a mutual
explanation, the relics of your sentimentalising."
"You've been coquetting
with her for twenty years and have trained her to the most ridiculous
habits."
"But don't trouble yourself, it's quite different now."
"She keeps
saying herself that she's only beginning now to 'have her eyes opened.'"
"I told her in so many words that all this friendship of yours is nothing
but a mutual pouring forth of sloppiness."
"She told me lots, my boy."
Foo!
what a flunkey's place you've been filling all this time.
"I positively
blushed for you."""
"""I filling a flunkey's place?"""
"cried Stepan Trofimovitch, unable to
restrain himself."
"""Worse, you've been a parasite, that is, a voluntary flunkey too lazy to
work, while you've an appetite for money."
"She, too, understands all that
now."
"It's awful the things she's been telling me about you, anyway."
"I
did laugh, my boy, over your letters to her; shameful and disgusting."
"But you're all so depraved, so depraved!"
"There's always something
depraving in charity--you're a good example of it!"""
"""She showed you my letters!"""
"""All; though, of course, one couldn't read them all."
"Foo, what a lot of
paper you've covered!"
"I believe there are more than two thousand letters
there."
"And do you know, old chap, I believe there was one moment when
she'd have been ready to marry you."
"You let slip your chance in the
silliest way."
"Of course, I'm speaking from your point of view, though,
anyway, it would have been better than now when you've almost been
married to 'cover another man's sins,' like a buffoon, for a jest, for
money."""
"""For money!"
"She, she says it was for money!"""
"Stepan Trofimovitch wailed
in anguish."
"""What else, then?"
"But, of course, I stood up for you."
"That's your only
line of defence, you know."
"She sees for herself that you needed money
like every one else, and that from that point of view maybe you were
right."
"I proved to her as clear as twice two makes four that it was a
mutual bargain."
"She was a capitalist and you were a sentimental buffoon
in her service."
"She's not angry about the money, though you have milked
her like a goat."
"She's only in a rage at having believed in you
for twenty years, at your having so taken her in over these noble
sentiments, and made her tell lies for so long."
"She never will admit
that she told lies of herself, but you'll catch it the more for that."
"I
can't make out how it was you didn't see that you'd have to have a day
of reckoning."
For after all you had some sense.
"I advised her yesterday
to put you in an almshouse, a genteel one, don't disturb yourself;
there'll be nothing humiliating; I believe that's what she'll do."
"Do you
remember your last letter to me, three weeks ago?"""
"""Can you have shown her that?"""
"cried Stepan Trofimovitch, leaping up in
horror."
"""Rather!"
First thing.
"The one in which you told me she was exploiting
you, envious of your talent; oh, yes, and that about 'other men's sins.'"
"You have got a conceit though, my boy!"
How I did laugh.
"As a rule your
letters are very tedious."
You write a horrible style.
"I often don't read
them at all, and I've one lying about to this day, unopened."
"I'll send
it to you to-morrow."
"But that one, that last letter of yours was the
tiptop of perfection!"
How I did laugh!
"Oh, how I laughed!"""
"""Monster, monster!"""
wailed Stepan Trofimovitch.
"""Foo, damn it all, there's no talking to you."
"I say, you're getting
huffy again as you were last Thursday."""
"Stepan Trofimovitch drew himself up, menacingly."
"""How dare you speak to me in such language?"""
"""What language?"
"It's simple and clear."""
"""Tell me, you monster, are you my son or not?"""
"""You know that best."
"To be sure all fathers are disposed to be blind in
such cases."""
"""Silence!"
"Silence!"""
"cried Stepan Trofimovitch, shaking all over."
"""You see you're screaming and swearing at me as you did last Thursday."
"You tried to lift your stick against me, but you know, I found that
document."
I was rummaging all the evening in my trunk from curiosity.
"It's true there's nothing definite, you can take that comfort."
"It's only
a letter of my mother's to that Pole."
"But to judge from her
character...""

""Another word and I'll box your ears."""
"""What a set of people!"""
"said Pyotr Stepanovitch, suddenly addressing
himself to me."
"""You see, this is how we've been ever since last
Thursday."
"I'm glad you're here this time, anyway, and can judge between
us."
"To begin with, a fact: he reproaches me for speaking like this of my
mother, but didn't he egg me on to it?"
"In Petersburg before I left the
High School, didn't he wake me twice in the night, to embrace me, and
cry like a woman, and what do you suppose he talked to me about at night?"
"Why, the same modest anecdotes about my mother!"
"It was from him I
first heard them."""
"""Oh, I meant that in a higher sense!"
"Oh, you didn't understand me!"
"You
understood nothing, nothing."""
"""But, anyway, it was meaner in you than in me, meaner, acknowledge that."
"You see, it's nothing to me if you like."
"I'm speaking from your point
of view."
Don't worry about my point of view.
"I don't blame my mother; if
it's you, then it's you, if it's a Pole, then it's a Pole, it's all the
same to me."
"I'm not to blame because you and she managed so stupidly in
Berlin."
As though you could have managed things better.
"Aren't you an
absurd set, after that?"
"And does it matter to you whether I'm your son
or not?"
"Listen,"" he went on, turning to me again, ""he's never spent a
penny on me all his life; till I was sixteen he didn't know me at all;
afterwards he robbed me here, and now he cries out that his heart has
been aching over me all his life, and carries on before me like an
actor."
"I'm not Varvara Petrovna, mind you."""
He got up and took his hat.
"""I curse you henceforth!"""
"Stepan Trofimovitch, as pale as death, stretched out his hand above him."
"""Ach, what folly a man will descend to!"""
"cried Pyotr Stepanovitch,
actually surprised."
"""Well, good-bye, old fellow, I shall never come and
see you again."
"Send me the article beforehand, don't forget, and try and
let it be free from nonsense."
"Facts, facts, facts."
"And above all, let it
be short."
"Good-bye."""
"III

Outside influences, too, had come into play in the matter, however."
Pyotr Stepanovitch certainly had some designs on his parent.
"In my
opinion he calculated upon reducing the old man to despair, and so to
driving him to some open scandal of a certain sort."
"This was to serve
some remote and quite other object of his own, of which I shall speak
hereafter."
"All sorts of plans and calculations of this kind were
swarming in masses in his mind at that time, and almost all, of course,
of a fantastic character."
"He had designs on another victim besides Stepan
Trofimovitch."
"In fact, as appeared afterwards, his victims were not few
in number, but this one he reckoned upon particularly, and it was Mr.
von Lembke himself."
"Andrey Antonovitch von Lembke belonged to that race, so favoured by
nature, which is reckoned by hundreds of thousands at the Russian
census, and is perhaps unconscious that it forms throughout its whole
mass a strictly organised union."
"And this union, of course, is not
planned and premeditated, but exists spontaneously in the whole race,
without words or agreements as a moral obligation consisting in mutual
support given by all members of the race to one another, at all times
and places, and under all circumstances."
"Andrey Antonovitch had
the honour of being educated in one of those more exalted Russian
educational institutions which are filled with the youth from families
well provided with wealth or connections."
"Almost immediately on
finishing their studies the pupils were appointed to rather important
posts in one of the government departments."
"Andrey Antonovitch had one
uncle a colonel of engineers, and another a baker."
"But he managed to get
into this aristocratic school, and met many of his fellow-countrymen in
a similar position."
"He was a good-humoured companion, was rather stupid
at his studies, but always popular."
"And when many of his companions in
the upper forms--chiefly Russians--had already learnt to discuss the
loftiest modern questions, and looked as though they were only
waiting to leave school to settle the affairs of the universe, Andrey
Antonovitch was still absorbed in the most innocent schoolboy interests."
"He amused them all, it is true, by his pranks, which were of a very
simple character, at the most a little coarse, but he made it his object
to be funny."
"At one time he would blow his nose in a wonderful way
when the professor addressed a question to him, thereby making his
schoolfellows and the professor laugh."
"Another time, in the dormitory,
he would act some indecent living picture, to the general applause,
or he would play the overture to ""Fra Diavolo"" with his nose rather
skilfully."
"He was distinguished, too, by intentional untidiness,
thinking this, for some reason, witty."
"In his very last year at school
he began writing Russian poetry."
"Of his native language he had only an ungrammatical knowledge, like many
of his race in Russia."
"This turn for versifying drew him to a gloomy
and depressed schoolfellow, the son of a poor Russian general, who was
considered in the school to be a great future light in literature."
"The
latter patronised him."
"But it happened that three years after leaving
school this melancholy schoolfellow, who had flung up his official
career for the sake of Russian literature, and was consequently going
about in torn boots, with his teeth chattering with cold, wearing a
light summer overcoat in the late autumn, met, one day on the Anitchin
bridge, his former protégé, ""Lembka,"" as he always used to be called at
school."
"And, what do you suppose?"
"He did not at first recognise him,
and stood still in surprise."
"Before him stood an irreproachably dressed
young man with wonderfully well-kept whiskers of a reddish hue, with
pince-nez, with patent-leather boots, and the freshest of gloves, in a
full overcoat from Sharmer's, and with a portfolio under his arm."
"Lembke
was cordial to his old schoolfellow, gave him his address, and begged
him to come and see him some evening."
"It appeared, too, that he was by
now not ""Lembka"" but ""Von Lembke."""
"The schoolfellow came to see him,
however, simply from malice perhaps."
"On the staircase, which was covered
with red felt and was rather ugly and by no means smart, he was met and
questioned by the house-porter."
A bell rang loudly upstairs.
"But instead
of the wealth which the visitor expected, he found Lembke in a
very little side-room, which had a dark and dilapidated appearance,
partitioned into two by a large dark green curtain, and furnished with
very old though comfortable furniture, with dark green blinds on
high narrow windows."
"Von Lembke lodged in the house of a very distant
relation, a general who was his patron."
"He met his visitor cordially,
was serious and exquisitely polite."
"They talked of literature, too, but
kept within the bounds of decorum."
"A manservant in a white tie brought
them some weak tea and little dry, round biscuits."
"The schoolfellow,
from spite, asked for some seltzer water."
"It was given him, but after
some delays, and Lembke was somewhat embarrassed at having to summon the
footman a second time and give him orders."
"But of himself he asked his
visitor whether he would like some supper, and was obviously relieved
when he refused and went away."
"In short, Lembke was making his career,
and was living in dependence on his fellow-countryman, the influential
general."
"He was at that time sighing for the general's fifth daughter, and it
seemed to him that his feeling was reciprocated."
"But Amalia was none the
less married in due time to an elderly factory-owner, a German, and
an old comrade of the general's."
"Andrey Antonovitch did not shed many
tears, but made a paper theatre."
"The curtain drew up, the actors came
in, and gesticulated with their arms."
"There were spectators in the
boxes, the orchestra moved their bows across their fiddles by machinery,
the conductor waved his baton, and in the stalls officers and dandies
clapped their hands."
"It was all made of cardboard, it was all thought
out and executed by Lembke himself."
"He spent six months over this
theatre."
The general arranged a friendly party on purpose.
"The theatre
was exhibited, all the general's five daughters, including the newly
married Amalia with her factory-owner, numerous fraus and frauleins
with their men folk, attentively examined and admired the theatre, after
which they danced."
Lembke was much gratified and was quickly consoled.
The years passed by and his career was secured.
"He always obtained good
posts and always under chiefs of his own race; and he worked his way up
at last to a very fine position for a man of his age."
"He had, for a long
time, been wishing to marry and looking about him carefully."
"Without
the knowledge of his superiors he had sent a novel to the editor of a
magazine, but it had not been accepted."
"On the other hand, he cut out
a complete toy railway, and again his creation was most successful."
"Passengers came on to the platform with bags and portmanteaux, with dogs
and children, and got into the carriages."
"The guards and porters moved
away, the bell was rung, the signal was given, and the train started
off."
He was a whole year busy over this clever contrivance.
"But he had
to get married all the same."
"The circle of his acquaintance was fairly
wide, chiefly in the world of his compatriots, but his duties brought
him into Russian spheres also, of course."
"Finally, when he was in his
thirty-ninth year, he came in for a legacy."
"His uncle the baker died,
and left him thirteen thousand roubles in his will."
"The one thing
needful was a suitable post."
"In spite of the rather elevated style of
his surroundings in the service, Mr. von Lembke was a very modest man."
"He would have been perfectly satisfied with some independent little
government post, with the right to as much government timber as he
liked, or something snug of that sort, and he would have been content
all his life long."
"But now, instead of the Minna or Ernestine he had
expected, Yulia Mihailovna suddenly appeared on the scene."
"His career
was instantly raised to a more elevated plane."
"The modest and precise
man felt that he too was capable of ambition."
"Yulia Mihailovna had a fortune of two hundred serfs, to reckon in the
old style, and she had besides powerful friends."
"On the other hand
Lembke was handsome, and she was already over forty."
"It is remarkable
that he fell genuinely in love with her by degrees as he became more
used to being betrothed to her."
"On the morning of his wedding day he
sent her a poem."
"She liked all this very much, even the poem; it's no
joke to be forty."
"He was very quickly raised to a certain grade and
received a certain order of distinction, and then was appointed governor
of our province."
"Before coming to us Yulia Mihailovna worked hard at moulding her
husband."
"In her opinion he was not without abilities, he knew how to
make an entrance and to appear to advantage, he understood how to
listen and be silent with profundity, had acquired a quite distinguished
deportment, could make a speech, indeed had even some odds and ends of
thought, and had caught the necessary gloss of modern liberalism."
"What
worried her, however, was that he was not very open to new ideas, and
after the long, everlasting plodding for a career, was unmistakably
beginning to feel the need of repose."
"She tried to infect him with her
own ambition, and he suddenly began making a toy church: the pastor came
out to preach the sermon, the congregation listened with their hands
before them, one lady was drying her tears with her handkerchief, one
old gentleman was blowing his nose; finally the organ pealed forth."
"It
had been ordered from Switzerland, and made expressly in spite of all
expense."
"Yulia Mihailovna, in positive alarm, carried off the whole
structure as soon as she knew about it, and locked it up in a box in
her own room."
"To make up for it she allowed him to write a novel on
condition of its being kept secret."
"From that time she began to reckon
only upon herself."
"Unhappily there was a good deal of shallowness and
lack of judgment in her attitude."
"Destiny had kept her too long an old
maid."
"Now one idea after another fluttered through her ambitious and
rather over-excited brain."
"She cherished designs, she positively desired
to rule the province, dreamed of becoming at once the centre of a
circle, adopted political sympathies."
"Von Lembke was actually a little
alarmed, though, with his official tact, he quickly divined that he had
no need at all to be uneasy about the government of the province itself."
The first two or three months passed indeed very satisfactorily.
"But now
Pyotr Stepanovitch had turned up, and something queer began to happen."
"The fact was that young Verhovensky, from the first step, had displayed
a flagrant lack of respect for Andrey Antonovitch, and had assumed a
strange right to dictate to him; while Yulia Mihailovna, who had always
till then been so jealous of her husband's dignity, absolutely refused
to notice it; or, at any rate, attached no consequence to it."
"The young
man became a favourite, ate, drank, and almost slept in the house."
"Von
Lembke tried to defend himself, called him ""young man"" before other
people, and slapped him patronisingly on the shoulder, but made no
impression."
"Pyotr Stepanovitch always seemed to be laughing in his face
even when he appeared on the surface to be talking seriously to him, and
he would say the most startling things to him before company."
"Returning
home one day he found the young man had installed himself in his study
and was asleep on the sofa there, uninvited."
"He explained that he had
come in, and finding no one at home had ""had a good sleep."""
Von Lembke was offended and again complained to his wife.
"Laughing at
his irritability she observed tartly that he evidently did not know how
to keep up his own dignity; and that with her, anyway, ""the boy"" had
never permitted himself any undue familiarity, ""he was naïve and fresh
indeed, though not regardful of the conventions of society."""
"Von Lembke
sulked."
This time she made peace between them.
"Pyotr Stepanovitch did
not go so far as to apologise, but got out of it with a coarse jest,
which might at another time have been taken for a fresh offence, but
was accepted on this occasion as a token of repentance."
"The weak spot
in Andrey Antonovitch's position was that he had blundered in the first
instance by divulging the secret of his novel to him."
"Imagining him
to be an ardent young man of poetic feeling and having long dreamed
of securing a listener, he had, during the early days of their
acquaintance, on one occasion read aloud two chapters to him."
"The young
man had listened without disguising his boredom, had rudely yawned,
had vouchsafed no word of praise; but on leaving had asked for the
manuscript that he might form an opinion of it at his leisure, and
Andrey Antonovitch had given it him."
"He had not returned the manuscript
since, though he dropped in every day, and had turned off all inquiries
with a laugh."
Afterwards he declared that he had lost it in the street.
"At the time Yulia Mihailovna was terribly angry with her husband when
she heard of it."
"""Perhaps you told him about the church too?"""
"she burst out almost in
dismay."
"Von Lembke unmistakably began to brood, and brooding was bad for him,
and had been forbidden by the doctors."
"Apart from the fact that there
were signs of trouble in the province, of which we will speak later, he
had private reasons for brooding, his heart was wounded, not merely his
official dignity."
"When Andrey Antonovitch had entered upon married life,
he had never conceived the possibility of conjugal strife, or dissension
in the future."
"It was inconsistent with the dreams he had cherished
all his life of his Minna or Ernestine."
"He felt that he was unequal to
enduring domestic storms."
"Yulia Mihailovna had an open explanation with
him at last."
"""You can't be angry at this,"" she said, ""if only because you've still as
much sense as he has, and are immeasurably higher in the social scale."
"The boy still preserves many traces of his old free-thinking habits;
I believe it's simply mischief; but one can do nothing suddenly, in a
hurry; you must do things by degrees."
"We must make much of our young
people; I treat them with affection and hold them back from the brink."""
"""But he says such dreadful things,"" Von Lembke objected."
"""I can't behave
tolerantly when he maintains in my presence and before other people
that the government purposely drenches the people with vodka in order to
brutalise them, and so keep them from revolution."
"Fancy my position when
I'm forced to listen to that before every one."""
"As he said this, Von Lembke recalled a conversation he had recently
had with Pyotr Stepanovitch."
"With the innocent object of displaying his
Liberal tendencies he had shown him his own private collection of every
possible kind of manifesto, Russian and foreign, which he had carefully
collected since the year 1859, not simply from a love of collecting but
from a laudable interest in them."
"Pyotr Stepanovitch, seeing his object,
expressed the opinion that there was more sense in one line of some
manifestoes than in a whole government department, ""not even excluding
yours, maybe."""
Lembke winced.
"""But this is premature among us, premature,"" he pronounced almost
imploringly, pointing to the manifestoes."
"""No, it's not premature; you see you're afraid, so it's not premature."""
"""But here, for instance, is an incitement to destroy churches."""
"""And why not?"
"You're a sensible man, and of course you don't believe
in it yourself, but you know perfectly well that you need religion to
brutalise the people."
"Truth is honester than falsehood....""

""I agree, I agree, I quite agree with you, but it is premature,
premature in this country..."" said Von Lembke, frowning."
"""And how can you be an official of the government after that, when you
agree to demolishing churches, and marching on Petersburg armed with
staves, and make it all simply a question of date?"""
Lembke was greatly put out at being so crudely caught.
"""It's not so, not so at all,"" he cried, carried away and more and more
mortified in his amour-propre."
"""You're young, and know nothing of
our aims, and that's why you're mistaken."
"You see, my dear Pyotr
Stepanovitch, you call us officials of the government, don't you?"
"Independent officials, don't you?"
"But let me ask you, how are we acting?"
"Ours is the responsibility, but in the long run we serve the cause of
progress just as you do."
"We only hold together what you are unsettling,
and what, but for us, would go to pieces in all directions."
"We are not
your enemies, not a bit of it."
"We say to you, go forward, progress, you
may even unsettle things, that is, things that are antiquated and in
need of reform."
"But we will keep you, when need be, within necessary
limits, and so save you from yourselves, for without us you would set
Russia tottering, robbing her of all external decency, while our task is
to preserve external decency."
"Understand that we are mutually essential
to one another."
"In England the Whigs and Tories are in the same way
mutually essential to one another."
"Well, you're Whigs and we're Tories."
"That's how I look at it."""
Andrey Antonovitch rose to positive eloquence.
"He had been fond of
talking in a Liberal and intellectual style even in Petersburg, and the
great thing here was that there was no one to play the spy on him."
"Pyotr Stepanovitch was silent, and maintained an unusually grave air."
This excited the orator more than ever.
"""Do you know that I, the 'person responsible for the province,'"" he went
on, walking about the study, ""do you know I have so many duties I can't
perform one of them, and, on the other hand, I can say just as truly
that there's nothing for me to do here."
"The whole secret of it is,
that everything depends upon the views of the government."
"Suppose the
government were ever to found a republic, from policy, or to pacify
public excitement, and at the same time to increase the power of the
governors, then we governors would swallow up the republic; and not the
republic only."
Anything you like we'll swallow up.
"I, at least, feel
that I am ready."
"In one word, if the government dictates to me by
telegram, _activité dévorante_, I'll supply _activité dévorante_."
"I've
told them here straight in their faces: 'Dear sirs, to maintain the
equilibrium and to develop all the provincial institutions one thing
is essential; the increase of the power of the governor.'"
"You see it's
necessary that all these institutions, the zemstvos, the law-courts,
should have a two-fold existence, that is, on the one hand, it's
necessary they should exist (I agree that it is necessary), on the other
hand, it's necessary that they shouldn't."
"It's all according to the
views of the government."
"If the mood takes them so that institutions
seem suddenly necessary, I shall have them at once in readiness."
"The
necessity passes and no one will find them under my rule."
"That's what
I understand by _activité dévorante_, and you can't have it without an
increase of the governor's power."
We're talking _tête-à-tête_.
"You know
I've already laid before the government in Petersburg the necessity of a
special sentinel before the governor's house."
"I'm awaiting an answer."""
"""You ought to have two,"" Pyotr Stepanovitch commented."
"""Why two?"""
"said Von Lembke, stopping short before him."
"""One's not enough to create respect for you."
"You certainly ought to have
two."""
Andrey Antonovitch made a wry face.
"""You... there's no limit to the liberties you take, Pyotr Stepanovitch."
"You take advantage of my good-nature, you say cutting things, and play
the part of a _bourru bienfaisant_....""

""Well, that's as you please,"" muttered Pyotr Stepanovitch; ""anyway you
pave the way for us and prepare for our success."""
"""Now, who are 'we,' and what success?"""
"said Von Lembke, staring at him
in surprise."
But he got no answer.
"Yulia Mihailovna, receiving a report of the conversation, was greatly
displeased."
"""But I can't exercise my official authority upon your favourite,""
Andrey Antonovitch protested in self-defence, ""especially when we're
_tête-à-tête_...."
"I may say too much... in the goodness of my heart."""
"""From too much goodness of heart."
"I didn't know you'd got a collection
of manifestoes."
"Be so good as to show them to me."""
"""But... he asked to have them for one day."""
"""And you've let him have them, again!"""
"cried Yulia Mihailovna getting
angry."
"""How tactless!"""
"""I'll send someone to him at once to get them."""
"""He won't give them up."""
"""I'll insist on it,"" cried Von Lembke, boiling over, and he jumped up
from his seat."
"""Who's he that we should be so afraid of him, and who am
I that I shouldn't dare to do any thing?"""
"""Sit down and calm yourself,"" said Yulia Mihailovna, checking him."
"""I will answer your first question."
"He came to me with the highest
recommendations."
"He's talented, and sometimes says extremely clever
things."
"Karmazinov tells me that he has connections almost everywhere,
and extraordinary influence over the younger generation in Petersburg
and Moscow."
"And if through him I can attract them all and group them
round myself, I shall be saving them from perdition by guiding them
into a new outlet for their ambitions."
"He's devoted to me with his whole
heart and is guided by me in everything."""
"""But while they're being petted... the devil knows what they may not do."
"Of course, it's an idea..."" said Von Lembke, vaguely defending himself,
""but... but here I've heard that manifestoes of some sort have been
found in X district."""
"""But there was a rumour of that in the summer--manifestoes, false
bank-notes, and all the rest of it, but they haven't found one of them
so far."
"Who told you?"""
"""I heard it from Von Blum."""
"""Ah, don't talk to me of your Blum."
"Don't ever dare mention him again!"""
"Yulia Mihailovna flew into a rage, and for a moment could not speak."
"Von
Blum was a clerk in the governor's office whom she particularly hated."
Of that later.
"""Please don't worry yourself about Verhovensky,"" she said in conclusion."
"""If he had taken part in any mischief he wouldn't talk as he does to
you, and every one else here."
"Talkers are not dangerous, and I will
even go so far as to say that if anything were to happen I should be the
first to hear of it through him."
"He's quite fanatically devoted to me."""
"I will observe, anticipating events that, had it not been for Yulia
Mihailovna's obstinacy and self-conceit, probably nothing of all the
mischief these wretched people succeeded in bringing about amongst us
would have happened."
She was responsible for a great deal.
"CHAPTER V. ON THE EVE OF THE FETE


I

The date of the fête which Yulia Mihailovna was getting up for the
benefit of the governesses of our province had been several times fixed
and put off."
"She had invariably bustling round her Pyotr Stepanovitch
and a little clerk, Lyamshin, who used at one time to visit Stepan
Trofimovitch, and had suddenly found favour in the governor's house for
the way he played the piano and now was of use running errands."
"Liputin
was there a good deal too, and Yulia Mihailovna destined him to be the
editor of a new independent provincial paper."
"There were also several
ladies, married and single, and lastly, even Karmazinov who, though he
could not be said to bustle, announced aloud with a complacent air that
he would agreeably astonish every one when the literary quadrille began."
"An extraordinary multitude of donors and subscribers had turned up, all
the select society of the town; but even the unselect were admitted, if
only they produced the cash."
"Yulia Mihailovna observed that sometimes it
was a positive duty to allow the mixing of classes, ""for otherwise who
is to enlighten them?"""
"A private drawing-room committee was formed, at which it was decided
that the fête was to be of a democratic character."
"The enormous list
of subscriptions tempted them to lavish expenditure."
"They wanted to do
something on a marvellous scale--that's why it was put off."
"They were
still undecided where the ball was to take place, whether in the immense
house belonging to the marshal's wife, which she was willing to give up
to them for the day, or at Varvara Petrovna's mansion at Skvoreshniki."
"It was rather a distance to Skvoreshniki, but many of the committee were
of opinion that it would be ""freer"" there."
"Varvara Petrovna would dearly
have liked it to have been in her house."
"It's difficult to understand
why this proud woman seemed almost making up to Yulia Mihailovna."
"Probably what pleased her was that the latter in her turn seemed almost
fawning upon Nikolay Vsyevolodovitch and was more gracious to him
than to anyone."
"I repeat again that Pyotr Stepanovitch was always, in
continual whispers, strengthening in the governor's household an idea he
had insinuated there already, that Nikolay Vsyevolodovitch was a man who
had very mysterious connections with very mysterious circles, and that
he had certainly come here with some commission from them."
People here seemed in a strange state of mind at the time.
"Among the
ladies especially a sort of frivolity was conspicuous, and it could
not be said to be a gradual growth."
"Certain very free-and-easy notions
seemed to be in the air."
"There was a sort of dissipated gaiety and
levity, and I can't say it was always quite pleasant."
"A lax way of
thinking was the fashion."
"Afterwards when it was all over, people blamed
Yulia Mihailovna, her circle, her attitude."
"But it can hardly have
been altogether due to Yulia Mihailovna."
"On the contrary; at first many
people vied with one another in praising the new governor's wife for her
success in bringing local society together, and for making things
more lively."
"Several scandalous incidents took place, for which Yulia
Mihailovna was in no way responsible, but at the time people were amused
and did nothing but laugh, and there was no one to check them."
"A rather
large group of people, it is true, held themselves aloof, and had views
of their own on the course of events."
"But even these made no complaint
at the time; they smiled, in fact."
"I remember that a fairly large circle came into existence, as it were,
spontaneously, the centre of which perhaps was really to be found
in Yulia Mihailovna's drawing-room."
"In this intimate circle which
surrounded her, among the younger members of it, of course, it was
considered admissible to play all sorts of pranks, sometimes rather
free-and-easy ones, and, in fact, such conduct became a principle among
them."
In this circle there were even some very charming ladies.
"The
young people arranged picnics, and even parties, and sometimes went
about the town in a regular cavalcade, in carriages and on horseback."
"They sought out adventures, even got them up themselves, simply for the
sake of having an amusing story to tell."
"They treated our town as though
it were a sort of Glupov."
"People called them the jeerers or sneerers,
because they did not stick at anything."
"It happened, for instance, that
the wife of a local lieutenant, a little brunette, very young though she
looked worn out from her husband's ill-treatment, at an evening party
thoughtlessly sat down to play whist for high stakes in the fervent hope
of winning enough to buy herself a mantle, and instead of winning, lost
fifteen roubles."
"Being afraid of her husband, and having no means of
paying, she plucked up the courage of former days and ventured on the
sly to ask for a loan, on the spot, at the party, from the son of our
mayor, a very nasty youth, precociously vicious."
"The latter not only
refused it, but went laughing aloud to tell her husband."
"The lieutenant,
who certainly was poor, with nothing but his salary, took his wife home
and avenged himself upon her to his heart's content in spite of her
shrieks, wails, and entreaties on her knees for forgiveness."
"This
revolting story excited nothing but mirth all over the town, and though
the poor wife did not belong to Yulia Mihailovna's circle, one of the
ladies of the ""cavalcade,"" an eccentric and adventurous character who
happened to know her, drove round, and simply carried her off to her
own house."
"Here she was at once taken up by our madcaps, made much of,
loaded with presents, and kept for four days without being sent back to
her husband."
"She stayed at the adventurous lady's all day long, drove
about with her and all the sportive company in expeditions about the
town, and took part in dances and merry-making."
"They kept egging her
on to haul her husband before the court and to make a scandal."
"They
declared that they would all support her and would come and bear
witness."
"The husband kept quiet, not daring to oppose them."
"The poor
thing realised at last that she had got into a hopeless position and,
more dead than alive with fright, on the fourth day she ran off in the
dusk from her protectors to her lieutenant."
"It's not definitely known
what took place between husband and wife, but two shutters of the
low-pitched little house in which the lieutenant lodged were not opened
for a fortnight."
"Yulia Mihailovna was angry with the mischief-makers
when she heard about it all, and was greatly displeased with the
conduct of the adventurous lady, though the latter had presented the
lieutenant's wife to her on the day she carried her off."
"However, this
was soon forgotten."
"Another time a petty clerk, a respectable head of a family, married his
daughter, a beautiful girl of seventeen, known to every one in the town,
to another petty clerk, a young man who came from a different district."
"But suddenly it was learned that the young husband had treated the
beauty very roughly on the wedding night, chastising her for what he
regarded as a stain on his honour."
"Lyamshin, who was almost a witness of
the affair, because he got drunk at the wedding and so stayed the night,
as soon as day dawned, ran round with the diverting intelligence."
"Instantly a party of a dozen was made up, all of them on horseback, some
on hired Cossack horses, Pyotr Stepanovitch, for instance, and Liputin,
who, in spite of his grey hairs, took part in almost every scandalous
adventure of our reckless youngsters."
"When the young couple appeared in
the street in a droshky with a pair of horses to make the calls which
are obligatory in our town on the day after a wedding, in spite of
anything that may happen, the whole cavalcade, with merry laughter,
surrounded the droshky and followed them about the town all the morning."
"They did not, it's true, go into the house, but waited for them
outside, on horseback."
"They refrained from marked insult to the bride
or bridegroom, but still they caused a scandal."
"The whole town began
talking of it."
"Every one laughed, of course."
"But at this Von Lembke was
angry, and again had a lively scene with Yulia Mihailovna."
"She, too, was
extremely angry, and formed the intention of turning the scapegraces out
of her house."
"But next day she forgave them all after persuasions from
Pyotr Stepanovitch and some words from Karmazinov, who considered the
affair rather amusing."
"""It's in harmony with the traditions of the place,"" he said."
"""Anyway
it's characteristic and... bold; and look, every one's laughing, you're
the only person indignant."""
"But there were pranks of a certain character that were absolutely past
endurance."
"A respectable woman of the artisan class, who went about selling
gospels, came into the town."
"People talked about her, because some
interesting references to these gospel women had just appeared in the
Petersburg papers."
"Again the same buffoon, Lyamshin, with the help of a
divinity student, who was taking a holiday while waiting for a post in
the school, succeeded, on the pretence of buying books from the gospel
woman, in thrusting into her bag a whole bundle of indecent and obscene
photographs from abroad, sacrificed expressly for the purpose, as we
learned afterwards, by a highly respectable old gentleman (I will omit
his name) with an order on his breast, who, to use his own words, loved
""a healthy laugh and a merry jest."""
"When the poor woman went to take out
the holy books in the bazaar, the photographs were scattered about the
place."
There were roars of laughter and murmurs of indignation.
"A crowd
collected, began abusing her, and would have come to blows if the police
had not arrived in the nick of time."
"The gospel woman was taken to
the lock-up, and only in the evening, thanks to the efforts of Mavriky
Nikolaevitch, who had learned with indignation the secret details of
this loathsome affair, she was released and escorted out of the town."
"At
this point Yulia Mihailovna would certainly have forbidden Lyamshin her
house, but that very evening the whole circle brought him to her with
the intelligence that he had just composed a new piece for the piano,
and persuaded her at least to hear it."
"The piece turned out to be really
amusing, and bore the comic title of ""The Franco-Prussian War."""
"It began
with the menacing strains of the ""Marseillaise"":

_""Qu'un sang impur abreuve nos sillons."
"""_

There is heard the pompous challenge, the intoxication of future
victories."
"But suddenly mingling with the masterly variations on the
national hymn, somewhere from some corner quite close, on one side come
the vulgar strains of ""Mein lieber Augustin."""
"The ""Marseillaise"" goes
on unconscious of them."
"The ""Marseillaise"" is at the climax of its
intoxication with its own grandeur; but Augustin gains strength;
Augustin grows more and more insolent, and suddenly the melody of
Augustin begins to blend with the melody of the ""Marseillaise."""
"The
latter begins, as it were, to get angry; becoming aware of Augustin
at last she tries to fling him off, to brush him aside like a tiresome
insignificant fly."
"But ""Mein lieber Augustin"" holds his ground firmly,
he is cheerful and self-confident, he is gleeful and impudent, and the
""Marseillaise"" seems suddenly to become terribly stupid."
"She can no
longer conceal her anger and mortification; it is a wail of indignation,
tears, and curses, with hands outstretched to Providence."
"_""Pas un pouce de notre terrain; pas une de nos forteresses."
"""_

But she is forced to sing in time with ""Mein lieber Augustin."""
"Her
melody passes in a sort of foolish way into Augustin; she yields and
dies away."
"And only by snatches there is heard again:

_""Qu'un sang impur...""_


But at once it passes very offensively into the vulgar waltz."
"She
submits altogether."
"It is Jules Favre sobbing on Bismarck's bosom
and surrendering every thing...."
"But at this point Augustin too grows
fierce; hoarse sounds are heard; there is a suggestion of countless
gallons of beer, of a frenzy of self-glorification, demands for
millions, for fine cigars, champagne, and hostages."
"Augustin passes into
a wild yell.... ""The Franco-Prussian War"" is over."
"Our circle applauded,
Yulia Mihailovna smiled, and said, ""Now, how is one to turn him out?"""
Peace was made.
The rascal really had talent.
"Stepan Trofimovitch
assured me on one occasion that the very highest artistic talents may
exist in the most abominable blackguards, and that the one thing
does not interfere with the other."
"There was a rumour afterwards that
Lyamshin had stolen this burlesque from a talented and modest young man
of his acquaintance, whose name remained unknown."
"But this is beside the
mark."
"This worthless fellow who had hung about Stepan Trofimovitch for
years, who used at his evening parties, when invited, to mimic Jews of
various types, a deaf peasant woman making her confession, or the birth
of a child, now at Yulia Mihailovna's caricatured Stepan Trofimovitch
himself in a killing way, under the title of ""A Liberal of the
Forties."""
"Everybody shook with laughter, so that in the end it was
quite impossible to turn him out: he had become too necessary a person."
"Besides he fawned upon Pyotr Stepanovitch in a slavish way, and he,
in his turn, had obtained by this time a strange and unaccountable
influence over Yulia Mihailovna."
"I wouldn't have talked about this scoundrel, and, indeed, he would not
be worth dwelling upon, but there was another revolting story, so people
declare, in which he had a hand, and this story I cannot omit from my
record."
"One morning the news of a hideous and revolting sacrilege was all over
the town."
"At the entrance to our immense marketplace there stands the
ancient church of Our Lady's Nativity, which was a remarkable antiquity
in our ancient town."
"At the gates of the precincts there is a large ikon
of the Mother of God fixed behind a grating in the wall."
"And behold, one
night the ikon had been robbed, the glass of the case was broken, the
grating was smashed and several stones and pearls (I don't know whether
they were very precious ones) had been removed from the crown and the
setting."
"But what was worse, besides the theft a senseless, scoffing
sacrilege had been perpetrated."
"Behind the broken glass of the ikon they
found in the morning, so it was said, a live mouse."
"Now, four months
since, it has been established beyond doubt that the crime was committed
by the convict Fedka, but for some reason it is added that Lyamshin took
part in it."
"At the time no one spoke of Lyamshin or had any suspicion
of him."
But now every one says it was he who put the mouse there.
"I
remember all our responsible officials were rather staggered."
"A crowd
thronged round the scene of the crime from early morning."
"There was a
crowd continually before it, not a very huge one, but always about a
hundred people, some coming and some going."
"As they approached they
crossed themselves and bowed down to the ikon."
"They began to give
offerings, and a church dish made its appearance, and with the dish a
monk."
"But it was only about three o'clock in the afternoon it occurred
to the authorities that it was possible to prohibit the crowds standing
about, and to command them when they had prayed, bowed down and left
their offerings, to pass on."
"Upon Von Lembke this unfortunate incident
made the gloomiest impression."
"As I was told, Yulia Mihailovna said
afterwards it was from this ill-omened morning that she first noticed in
her husband that strange depression which persisted in him until he
left our province on account of illness two months ago, and, I believe,
haunts him still in Switzerland, where he has gone for a rest after his
brief career amongst us."
"I remember at one o'clock in the afternoon I crossed the marketplace;
the crowd was silent and their faces solemn and gloomy."
"A merchant, fat
and sallow, drove up, got out of his carriage, made a bow to the ground,
kissed the ikon, offered a rouble, sighing, got back into his carriage
and drove off."
"Another carriage drove up with two ladies accompanied
by two of our scapegraces."
"The young people (one of whom was not quite
young) got out of their carriage too, and squeezed their way up to the
ikon, pushing people aside rather carelessly."
"Neither of the young men
took off his hat, and one of them put a pince-nez on his nose."
"In the
crowd there was a murmur, vague but unfriendly."
"The dandy with the
pince-nez took out of his purse, which was stuffed full of bank-notes,
a copper farthing and flung it into the dish."
"Both laughed, and, talking
loudly, went back to their carriage."
"At that moment Lizaveta Nikolaevna
galloped up, escorted by Mavriky Nikolaevitch."
"She jumped off her horse,
flung the reins to her companion, who, at her bidding, remained on his
horse, and approached the ikon at the very moment when the farthing had
been flung down."
"A flush of indignation suffused her cheeks; she took
off her round hat and her gloves, fell straight on her knees before the
ikon on the muddy pavement, and reverently bowed down three times to the
earth."
"Then she took out her purse, but as it appeared she had only a
few small coins in it she instantly took off her diamond ear-rings and
put them in the dish."
"""May I?"
May I?
"For the adornment of the setting?"""
she asked the monk.
"""It is permitted,"" replied the latter, ""every gift is good."""
"The crowd
was silent, expressing neither dissent nor approval."
"Liza got on her horse again, in her muddy riding-habit, and galloped
away."
"II

Two days after the incident I have described I met her in a numerous
company, who were driving out on some expedition in three coaches,
surrounded by others on horseback."
"She beckoned to me, stopped her
carriage, and pressingly urged me to join their party."
"A place was
found for me in the carriage, and she laughingly introduced me to her
companions, gorgeously attired ladies, and explained to me that they
were all going on a very interesting expedition."
"She was laughing, and
seemed somewhat excessively happy."
"Just lately she had been very lively,
even playful, in fact."
The expedition was certainly an eccentric one.
"They were all going to a
house the other side of the river, to the merchant Sevastyanov's."
"In
the lodge of this merchant's house our saint and prophet, Semyon
Yakovlevitch, who was famous not only amongst us but in the surrounding
provinces and even in Petersburg and Moscow, had been living for the
last ten years, in retirement, ease, and comfort."
"Every one went to see
him, especially visitors to the neighbourhood, extracting from him some
crazy utterance, bowing down to him, and leaving an offering."
"These
offerings were sometimes considerable, and if Semyon Yakovlevitch did
not himself assign them to some other purpose were piously sent to
some church or more often to the monastery of Our Lady."
"A monk from
the monastery was always in waiting upon Semyon Yakovlevitch with this
object."
All were in expectation of great amusement.
"No one of the party had seen
Semyon Yakovlevitch before, except Lyamshin, who declared that the saint
had given orders that he should be driven out with a broom, and had with
his own hand flung two big baked potatoes after him."
"Among the party I
noticed Pyotr Stepanovitch, again riding a hired Cossack horse, on which
he sat extremely badly, and Nikolay Vsyevolodovitch, also on horseback."
"The latter did not always hold aloof from social diversions, and on such
occasions always wore an air of gaiety, although, as always, he spoke
little and seldom."
"When our party had crossed the bridge and reached the
hotel of the town, someone suddenly announced that in one of the rooms
of the hotel they had just found a traveller who had shot himself, and
were expecting the police."
"At once the suggestion was made that they
should go and look at the suicide."
"The idea met with approval: our
ladies had never seen a suicide."
"I remember one of them said aloud on
the occasion, ""Everything's so boring, one can't be squeamish over one's
amusements, as long as they're interesting."""
"Only a few of them remained
outside."
"The others went in a body into the dirty corridor, and amongst
the others I saw, to my amazement, Lizaveta Nikolaevna."
"The door of the
room was open, and they did not, of course, dare to prevent our going
in to look at the suicide."
"He was quite a young lad, not more than
nineteen."
"He must have been very good-looking, with thick fair hair,
with a regular oval face, and a fine, pure forehead."
"The body was
already stiff, and his white young face looked like marble."
"On the table
lay a note, in his handwriting, to the effect that no one was to blame
for his death, that he had killed himself because he had ""squandered""
four hundred roubles."
"The word ""squandered"" was used in the letter; in
the four lines of his letter there were three mistakes in spelling."
"A
stout country gentleman, evidently a neighbour, who had been staying in
the hotel on some business of his own, was particularly distressed about
it."
"From his words it appeared that the boy had been sent by his family,
that is, a widowed mother, sisters, and aunts, from the country to the
town in order that, under the supervision of a female relation in the
town, he might purchase and take home with him various articles for the
trousseau of his eldest sister, who was going to be married."
"The family
had, with sighs of apprehension, entrusted him with the four hundred
roubles, the savings of ten years, and had sent him on his way with
exhortations, prayers, and signs of the cross."
"The boy had till then
been well-behaved and trustworthy."
"Arriving three days before at the
town, he had not gone to his relations, had put up at the hotel, and
gone straight to the club in the hope of finding in some back room a
""travelling banker,"" or at least some game of cards for money."
"But that
evening there was no ""banker"" there or gambling going on."
"Going back
to the hotel about midnight he asked for champagne, Havana cigars, and
ordered a supper of six or seven dishes."
"But the champagne made him
drunk, and the cigar made him sick, so that he did not touch the food
when it was brought to him, and went to bed almost unconscious."
"Waking
next morning as fresh as an apple, he went at once to the gipsies' camp,
which was in a suburb beyond the river, and of which he had heard the
day before at the club."
He did not reappear at the hotel for two days.
"At last, at five o'clock in the afternoon of the previous day, he had
returned drunk, had at once gone to bed, and had slept till ten o'clock
in the evening."
"On waking up he had asked for a cutlet, a bottle of
Chateau d'Yquem, and some grapes, paper, and ink, and his bill."
"No one
noticed anything special about him; he was quiet, gentle, and friendly."
"He must have shot himself at about midnight, though it was strange that
no one had heard the shot, and they only raised the alarm at midday,
when, after knocking in vain, they had broken in the door."
"The bottle of
Chateau d'Yquem was half empty, there was half a plateful of grapes left
too."
"The shot had been fired from a little three-chambered revolver,
straight into the heart."
Very little blood had flowed.
"The revolver had
dropped from his hand on to the carpet."
"The boy himself was half lying
in a corner of the sofa."
Death must have been instantaneous.
"There was
no trace of the anguish of death in the face; the expression was serene,
almost happy, as though there were no cares in his life."
"All our party
stared at him with greedy curiosity."
"In every misfortune of one's
neighbour there is always something cheering for an onlooker--whoever
he may be."
"Our ladies gazed in silence, their companions distinguished
themselves by their wit and their superb equanimity."
"One observed that
his was the best way out of it, and that the boy could not have hit upon
anything more sensible; another observed that he had had a good time if
only for a moment."
"A third suddenly blurted out the inquiry why people
had begun hanging and shooting themselves among us of late, as though
they had suddenly lost their roots, as though the ground were giving way
under every one's feet."
People looked coldly at this raisonneur.
"Then
Lyamshin, who prided himself on playing the fool, took a bunch of grapes
from the plate; another, laughing, followed his example, and a third
stretched out his hand for the Chateau d'Yquem."
"But the head of police
arriving checked him, and even ordered that the room should be cleared."
"As every one had seen all they wanted they went out without disputing,
though Lyamshin began pestering the police captain about something."
"The
general merrymaking, laughter, and playful talk were twice as lively on
the latter half of the way."
We arrived at Semyon Yakovlevitch's just at one o'clock.
"The gate of the
rather large house stood unfastened, and the approach to the lodge was
open."
"We learnt at once that Semyon Yakovlevitch was dining, but was
receiving guests."
The whole crowd of us went in.
"The room in which the
saint dined and received visitors had three windows, and was fairly
large."
"It was divided into two equal parts by a wooden lattice-work
partition, which ran from wall to wall, and was three or four feet high."
"Ordinary visitors remained on the outside of this partition, but lucky
ones were by the saint's invitation admitted through the partition doors
into his half of the room."
"And if so disposed he made them sit down on
the sofa or on his old leather chairs."
"He himself invariably sat in
an old-fashioned shabby Voltaire arm-chair."
"He was a rather big,
bloated-looking, yellow-faced man of five and fifty, with a bald head
and scanty flaxen hair."
"He wore no beard; his right cheek was swollen,
and his mouth seemed somehow twisted awry."
"He had a large wart on
the left side of his nose; narrow eyes, and a calm, stolid, sleepy
expression."
"He was dressed in European style, in a black coat, but had
no waistcoat or tie."
"A rather coarse, but white shirt, peeped out below
his coat."
"There was something the matter with his feet, I believe, and
he kept them in slippers."
"I've heard that he had at one time been a
clerk, and received a rank in the service."
"He had just finished some
fish soup, and was beginning his second dish of potatoes in their skins,
eaten with salt."
"He never ate anything else, but he drank a great
deal of tea, of which he was very fond."
"Three servants provided by
the merchant were running to and fro about him."
"One of them was in a
swallow-tail, the second looked like a workman, and the third like
a verger."
There was also a very lively boy of sixteen.
"Besides the
servants there was present, holding a jug, a reverend, grey-headed
monk, who was a little too fat."
"On one of the tables a huge samovar was
boiling, and a tray with almost two dozen glasses was standing near it."
"On another table opposite offerings had been placed: some loaves and
also some pounds of sugar, two pounds of tea, a pair of embroidered
slippers, a foulard handkerchief, a length of cloth, a piece of linen,
and so on."
Money offerings almost all went into the monk's jug.
"The room
was full of people, at least a dozen visitors, of whom two were sitting
with Semyon Yakovlevitch on the other side of the partition."
"One was a
grey-headed old pilgrim of the peasant class, and the other a little,
dried-up monk, who sat demurely, with his eyes cast down."
"The other
visitors were all standing on the near side of the partition, and
were mostly, too, of the peasant class, except one elderly and
poverty-stricken lady, one landowner, and a stout merchant, who had come
from the district town, a man with a big beard, dressed in the Russian
style, though he was known to be worth a hundred thousand."
"All were waiting for their chance, not daring to speak of themselves."
"Four were on their knees, but the one who attracted most attention
was the landowner, a stout man of forty-five, kneeling right at the
partition, more conspicuous than any one, waiting reverently for a
propitious word or look from Semyon Yakovlevitch."
"He had been there for
about an hour already, but the saint still did not notice him."
"Our ladies crowded right up to the partition, whispering gaily and
laughingly together."
"They pushed aside or got in front of all the other
visitors, even those on their knees, except the landowner, who remained
obstinately in his prominent position even holding on to the
partition."
"Merry and greedily inquisitive eyes were turned upon Semyon
Yakovlevitch, as well as lorgnettes, pince-nez, and even opera-glasses."
"Lyamshin, at any rate, looked through an opera-glass."
"Semyon
Yakovlevitch calmly and lazily scanned all with his little eyes."
"""Milovzors!"
"Milovzors!"""
"he deigned to pronounce, in a hoarse bass, and
slightly staccato."
"All our party laughed: ""What's the meaning of 'Milovzors'?"""
"But Semyon
Yakovlevitch relapsed into silence, and finished his potatoes."
"Presently
he wiped his lips with his napkin, and they handed him tea."
"As a rule, he did not take tea alone, but poured out some for his
visitors, but by no means for all, usually pointing himself to those
he wished to honour."
"And his choice always surprised people by its
unexpectedness."
"Passing by the wealthy and the high-placed, he sometimes
pitched upon a peasant or some decrepit old woman."
"Another time he
would pass over the beggars to honour some fat wealthy merchant."
"Tea was
served differently, too, to different people, sugar was put into some of
the glasses and handed separately with others, while some got it without
any sugar at all."
"This time the favoured one was the monk sitting by
him, who had sugar put in; and the old pilgrim, to whom it was given
without any sugar."
"The fat monk with the jug, from the monastery, for
some reason had none handed to him at all, though up till then he had
had his glass every day."
"""Semyon Yakovlevitch, do say something to me."
"I've been longing to make
your acquaintance for ever so long,"" carolled the gorgeously dressed
lady from our carriage, screwing up her eyes and smiling."
"She was
the lady who had observed that one must not be squeamish about one's
amusements, so long as they were interesting."
"Semyon Yakovlevitch did
not even look at her."
"The kneeling landowner uttered a deep, sonorous
sigh, like the sound of a big pair of bellows."
"""With sugar in it!"""
"said Semyon Yakovlevitch suddenly, pointing to the
wealthy merchant."
"The latter moved forward and stood beside the kneeling
gentleman."
"""Some more sugar for him!"""
"ordered Semyon Yakovlevitch, after the glass
had already been poured out."
They put some more in.
"""More, more, for
him!"""
"More was put in a third time, and again a fourth."
"The merchant
began submissively drinking his syrup."
"""Heavens!"""
"whispered the people, crossing themselves."
"The kneeling
gentleman again heaved a deep, sonorous sigh."
"""Father!"
"Semyon Yakovlevitch!"""
"The voice of the poor lady rang out all
at once plaintively, though so sharply that it was startling."
"Our party
had shoved her back to the wall."
"""A whole hour, dear father, I've been
waiting for grace."
Speak to me.
"Consider my case in my helplessness."""
"""Ask her,"" said Semyon Yakovlevitch to the verger, who went to the
partition."
"""Have you done what Semyon Yakovlevitch bade you last time?"""
"he asked
the widow in a soft and measured voice."
"""Done it!"
Father Semyon Yakovlevitch.
"How can one do it with them?"""
wailed the widow.
"""They're cannibals; they're lodging a complaint
against me, in the court; they threaten to take it to the senate."
"That's
how they treat their own mother!"""
"""Give her!"""
Semyon Yakovlevitch pointed to a sugar-loaf.
"The boy skipped
up, seized the sugar-loaf and dragged it to the widow."
"""Ach, father; great is your merciful kindness."
"What am I to do with so
much?"""
wailed the widow.
"""More, more,"" said Semyon Yakovlevitch lavishly."
They dragged her another sugar-loaf.
"""More, more!"""
the saint commanded.
"They took her a third, and finally a fourth."
"The widow was surrounded
with sugar on all sides."
"The monk from the monastery sighed; all this
might have gone to the monastery that day as it had done on former
occasions."
"""What am I to do with so much,"" the widow sighed obsequiously."
"""It's
enough to make one person sick!..."
"Is it some sort of a prophecy,
father?"""
"""Be sure it's by way of a prophecy,"" said someone in the crowd."
"""Another pound for her, another!"""
Semyon Yakovlevitch persisted.
"There was a whole sugar-loaf still on the table, but the saint ordered a
pound to be given, and they gave her a pound."
"""Lord have mercy on us!"""
"gasped the people, crossing themselves."
"""It's
surely a prophecy."""
"""Sweeten your heart for the future with mercy and loving kindness, and
then come to make complaints against your own children; bone of your
bone."
"That's what we must take this emblem to mean,"" the stout monk
from the monastery, who had had no tea given to him, said softly but
self-complacently, taking upon himself the rôle of interpreter in an
access of wounded vanity."
"""What are you saying, father?"""
"cried the widow, suddenly infuriated."
"""Why, they dragged me into the fire with a rope round me when the
Verhishins' house was burnt, and they locked up a dead cat in my chest."
"They are ready to do any villainy....""

""Away with her!"
"Away with her!"""
"Semyon Yakovlevitch said suddenly,
waving his hands."
The verger and the boy dashed through the partition.
"The verger took the
widow by the arm, and without resisting she trailed to the door, keeping
her eyes fixed on the loaves of sugar that had been bestowed on her,
which the boy dragged after her."
"""One to be taken away."
"Take it away,"" Semyon Yakovlevitch commanded to
the servant like a workman, who remained with him."
"The latter rushed
after the retreating woman, and the three servants returned somewhat
later bringing back one loaf of sugar which had been presented to the
widow and now taken away from her."
"She carried off three, however."
"""Semyon Yakovlevitch,"" said a voice at the door."
"""I dreamt of a bird, a
jackdaw; it flew out of the water and flew into the fire."
"What does the
dream mean?"""
"""Frost,"" Semyon Yakovlevitch pronounced."
"""Semyon Yakovlevitch, why don't you answer me all this time?"
"I've been
interested in you ever so long,"" the lady of our party began again."
"""Ask him!"""
"said Semyon Yakovlevitch, not heeding her, but pointing to
the kneeling gentleman."
"The monk from the monastery to whom the order was given moved sedately
to the kneeling figure."
"""How have you sinned?"
"And was not some command laid upon you?"""
"""Not to fight; not to give the rein to my hands,"" answered the kneeling
gentleman hoarsely."
"""Have you obeyed?"""
asked the monk.
"""I cannot obey."
"My own strength gets the better of me."""
"""Away with him, away with him!"
"With a broom, with a broom!"""
"cried Semyon
Yakovlevitch, waving his hands."
"The gentleman rushed out of the room
without waiting for this penalty."
"""He's left a gold piece where he knelt,"" observed the monk, picking up a
half-imperial."
"""For him!"""
"said the saint, pointing to the rich merchant."
"The latter
dared not refuse it, and took it."
"""Gold to gold,"" the monk from the monastery could not refrain from
saying."
"""And give him some with sugar in it,"" said the saint, pointing to
Mavriky Nikolaevitch."
"The servant poured out the tea and took it by
mistake to the dandy with the pince-nez."
"""The long one, the long one!"""
Semyon Yakovlevitch corrected him.
"Mavriky Nikolaevitch took the glass, made a military half-bow, and began
drinking it."
"I don't know why, but all our party burst into peals of
laughter."
"""Mavriky Nikolaevitch,"" cried Liza, addressing him suddenly."
"""That
kneeling gentleman has gone away."
"You kneel down in his place."""
Mavriky Nikolaevitch looked at her in amazement.
"""I beg you to."
You'll do me the greatest favour.
"Listen, Mavriky
Nikolaevitch,"" she went on, speaking in an emphatic, obstinate, excited,
and rapid voice."
"""You must kneel down; I must see you kneel down."
"If you
won't, don't come near me."
"I insist, I insist!"""
"I don't know what she meant by it; but she insisted upon it
relentlessly, as though she were in a fit."
"Mavriky Nikolaevitch, as
we shall see later, set down these capricious impulses, which had been
particularly frequent of late, to outbreaks of blind hatred for him,
not due to spite, for, on the contrary, she esteemed him, loved him,
and respected him, and he knew that himself--but from a peculiar
unconscious hatred which at times she could not control."
"In silence he gave his cup to an old woman standing behind him, opened
the door of the partition, and, without being invited, stepped into
Semyon Yakovlevitch's private apartment, and knelt down in the middle
of the room in sight of all."
"I imagine that he was deeply shocked in his
candid and delicate heart by Liza's coarse and mocking freak before
the whole company."
"Perhaps he imagined that she would feel ashamed of
herself, seeing his humiliation, on which she had so insisted."
"Of course
no one but he would have dreamt of bringing a woman to reason by
so naïve and risky a proceeding."
"He remained kneeling with his
imperturbable gravity--long, tall, awkward, and ridiculous."
"But our
party did not laugh."
"The unexpectedness of the action produced a painful
shock."
Every one looked at Liza.
"""Anoint, anoint!"""
muttered Semyon Yakovlevitch.
"Liza suddenly turned white, cried out, and rushed through the partition."
Then a rapid and hysterical scene followed.
"She began pulling Mavriky
Nikolaevitch up with all her might, tugging at his elbows with both
hands."
"""Get up!"
"Get up!"""
"she screamed, as though she were crazy."
"""Get up at
once, at once."
"How dare you?"""
Mavriky Nikolaevitch got up from his knees.
"She clutched his arms above
the elbow and looked intently into his face."
"There was terror in her
expression."
"""Milovzors!"
"Milovzors!"""
Semyon Yakovlevitch repeated again.
"She dragged Mavriky Nikolaevitch back to the other part of the room at
last."
There was some commotion in all our company.
"The lady from our
carriage, probably intending to relieve the situation, loudly and
shrilly asked the saint for the third time, with an affected smile:

""Well, Semyon Yakovlevitch, won't you utter some saying for me?"
"I've
been reckoning so much on you."""
"""Out with the ----, out with the ----,"" said Semyon Yakovlevitch, suddenly
addressing her, with an extremely indecent word."
"The words were uttered
savagely, and with horrifying distinctness."
"Our ladies shrieked, and
rushed headlong away, while the gentlemen escorting them burst into
Homeric laughter."
So ended our visit to Semyon Yakovlevitch.
"At this point, however, there took place, I am told, an extremely
enigmatic incident, and, I must own, it was chiefly on account of it
that I have described this expedition so minutely."
"I am told that when all flocked out, Liza, supported by Mavriky
Nikolaevitch, was jostled against Nikolay Vsyevolodovitch in the crush
in the doorway."
"I must mention that since that Sunday morning when she
fainted they had not approached each other, nor exchanged a word, though
they had met more than once."
I saw them brought together in the doorway.
"I fancied they both stood still for an instant, and looked, as it were,
strangely at one another, but I may not have seen rightly in the
crowd."
"It is asserted, on the contrary, and quite seriously, that Liza,
glancing at Nikolay Vsyevolodovitch, quickly raised her hand to the
level of his face, and would certainly have struck him if he had not
drawn back in time."
"Perhaps she was displeased with the expression of
his face, or the way he smiled, particularly just after such an episode
with Mavriky Nikolaevitch."
"I must admit I saw nothing myself, but all
the others declared they had, though they certainly could not all have
seen it in such a crush, though perhaps some may have."
"But I did
not believe it at the time."
"I remember, however, that Nikolay
Vsyevolodovitch was rather pale all the way home."
"III

Almost at the same time, and certainly on the same day, the interview
at last took place between Stepan Trofimovitch and Varvara Petrovna."
"She
had long had this meeting in her mind, and had sent word about it to
her former friend, but for some reason she had kept putting it off till
then."
"It took place at Skvoreshniki; Varvara Petrovna arrived at her
country house all in a bustle; it had been definitely decided the
evening before that the fête was to take place at the marshal's, but
Varvara Petrovna's rapid brain at once grasped that no one could
prevent her from afterwards giving her own special entertainment at
Skvoreshniki, and again assembling the whole town."
"Then every one could
see for themselves whose house was best, and in which more taste was
displayed in receiving guests and giving a ball."
"Altogether she was
hardly to be recognised."
"She seemed completely transformed, and instead
of the unapproachable ""noble lady"" (Stepan Trofimovitch's expression)
seemed changed into the most commonplace, whimsical society woman."
"But
perhaps this may only have been on the surface."
"When she reached the empty house she had gone through all the rooms,
accompanied by her faithful old butler, Alexey Yegorytch, and by
Fomushka, a man who had seen much of life and was a specialist in
decoration."
"They began to consult and deliberate: what furniture was to
be brought from the town house, what things, what pictures, where they
were to be put, how the conservatories and flowers could be put to
the best use, where to put new curtains, where to have the refreshment
rooms, whether one or two, and so on and so on."
"And, behold, in the
midst of this exciting bustle she suddenly took it into her head to send
for Stepan Trofimovitch."
"The latter had long before received notice of this interview and was
prepared for it, and he had every day been expecting just such a sudden
summons."
"As he got into the carriage he crossed himself: his fate was
being decided."
"He found his friend in the big drawing-room on the little
sofa in the recess, before a little marble table with a pencil and paper
in her hands."
"Fomushka, with a yard measure, was measuring the height
of the galleries and the windows, while Varvara Petrovna herself was
writing down the numbers and making notes on the margin."
"She nodded in
Stepan Trofimovitch's direction without breaking off from what she was
doing, and when the latter muttered some sort of greeting, she hurriedly
gave him her hand, and without looking at him motioned him to a seat
beside her."
"""I sat waiting for five minutes, 'mastering my heart,'"" he told me
afterwards."
"""I saw before me not the woman whom I had known for twenty
years."
"An absolute conviction that all was over gave me a strength which
astounded even her."
"I swear that she was surprised at my stoicism in
that last hour."""
"Varvara Petrovna suddenly put down her pencil on the table and turned
quickly to Stepan Trofimovitch."
"""Stepan Trofimovitch, we have to talk of business."
"I'm sure you have
prepared all your fervent words and various phrases, but we'd better go
straight to the point, hadn't we?"""
She had been in too great a hurry to show the tone she meant to take.
And what might not come next?
"""Wait, be quiet; let me speak."
"Afterwards you shall, though really I
don't know what you can answer me,"" she said in a rapid patter."
"""The
twelve hundred roubles of your pension I consider a sacred obligation
to pay you as long as you live."
"Though why a sacred obligation, simply
a contract; that would be a great deal more real, wouldn't it?"
"If you
like, we'll write it out."
"Special arrangements have been made in case
of my death."
"But you are receiving from me at present lodging, servants,
and your maintenance in addition."
"Reckoning that in money it would
amount to fifteen hundred roubles, wouldn't it?"
"I will add another three
hundred roubles, making three thousand roubles in all."
"Will that be
enough a year for you?"
I think that's not too little?
"In any extreme
emergency I would add something more."
"And so, take your money, send me
back my servants, and live by yourself where you like in Petersburg, in
Moscow, abroad, or here, only not with me."
"Do you hear?"""
"""Only lately those lips dictated to me as imperatively and as suddenly
very different demands,"" said Stepan Trofimovitch slowly and with
sorrowful distinctness."
"""I submitted... and danced the Cossack dance
to please you."
"_Oui, la comparaison peut être permise."
"C'était comme un
petit Cosaque du Don qui sautait sur sa propre tombe._ Now...""

""Stop, Stepan Trofimovitch, you are horribly long-winded."
"You didn't
dance, but came to see me in a new tie, new linen, gloves, scented
and pomatumed."
"I assure you that you were very anxious to get married
yourself; it was written on your face, and I assure you a most unseemly
expression it was."
"If I did not mention it to you at the time, it was
simply out of delicacy."
"But you wished it, you wanted to be married, in
spite of the abominable things you wrote about me and your betrothed."
Now it's very different.
"And what has the Cosaque du Don to do with it,
and what tomb do you mean?"
I don't understand the comparison.
"On the
contrary, you have only to live."
Live as long as you can.
"I shall be
delighted."""
"""In an almshouse?"""
"""In an almshouse?"
"People don't go into almshouses with three thousand
roubles a year."
"Ah, I remember,"" she laughed."
"""Pyotr Stepanovitch
did joke about an almshouse once."
"Bah, there certainly is a special
almshouse, which is worth considering."
"It's for persons who are highly
respectable; there are colonels there, and there's positively one
general who wants to get into it."
"If you went into it with all your
money, you would find peace, comfort, servants to wait on you."
"There you
could occupy yourself with study, and could always make up a party for
cards."""
"_""Passons."
"""_

_""Passons?"
"""_ Varvara Petrovna winced."
"""But, if so, that's all."
"You've been
informed that we shall live henceforward entirely apart."""
"""And that's all?"""
he said.
"""All that's left of twenty years?"
"Our last
farewell?"""
"""You're awfully fond of these exclamations, Stepan Trofimovitch."
"It's
not at all the fashion."
Nowadays people talk roughly but simply.
"You
keep harping on our twenty years!"
"Twenty years of mutual vanity, and
nothing more."
"Every letter you've written me was written not for me but
for posterity."
"You're a stylist, and not a friend, and friendship is
only a splendid word."
"In reality--a mutual exchange of sloppiness....""

""Good heavens!"
How many sayings not your own!
Lessons learned by heart!
They've already put their uniform on you too.
"You, too, are rejoicing;
you, too, are basking in the sunshine."
"_Chère, chère,_ for what a mess of
pottage you have sold them your freedom!"""
"""I'm not a parrot, to repeat other people's phrases!"""
"cried Varvara
Petrovna, boiling over."
"""You may be sure I have stored up many sayings
of my own."
What have you been doing for me all these twenty years?
"You
refused me even the books I ordered for you, though, except for the
binder, they would have remained uncut."
"What did you give me to read
when I asked you during those first years to be my guide?"
"Always Kapfig,
and nothing but Kapfig."
"You were jealous of my culture even, and took
measures."
And all the while every one's laughing at you.
"I must confess
I always considered you only as a critic."
"You are a literary critic and
nothing more."
"When on the way to Petersburg I told you that I meant
to found a journal and to devote my whole life to it, you looked at me
ironically at once, and suddenly became horribly supercilious."""
"""That was not that, not that.... we were afraid then of
persecution....""

""It was just that."
"And you couldn't have been afraid of persecution in
Petersburg at that time."
"Do you remember that in February, too, when the
news of the emancipation came, you ran to me in a panic, and demanded
that I should at once give you a written statement that the proposed
magazine had nothing to do with you; that the young people had been
coming to see me and not you; that you were only a tutor who lived in
the house, only because he had not yet received his salary."
"Isn't that
so?"
Do remember that?
"You have distinguished yourself all your life,
Stepan Trofimovitch."""
"""That was only a moment of weakness, a moment when we were alone,"" he
exclaimed mournfully."
"""But is it possible, is it possible, to break
off everything for the sake of such petty impressions?"
"Can it be that
nothing more has been left between us after those long years?"""
"""You are horribly calculating; you keep trying to leave me in your debt."
"When you came back from abroad you looked down upon me and wouldn't
let me utter a word, but when I came back myself and talked to you
afterwards of my impressions of the Madonna, you wouldn't hear me,
you began smiling condescendingly into your cravat, as though I were
incapable of the same feelings as you."""
"""It was not so."
It was probably not so.
"_J'ai oublié!_""

""No; it was so,"" she answered, ""and, what's more, you've nothing to
pride yourself on."
"That's all nonsense, and one of your fancies."
"Now,
there's no one, absolutely no one, in ecstasies over the Madonna; no
one wastes time over it except old men who are hopelessly out of date."
"That's established."""
"""Established, is it?"""
"""It's of no use whatever."
"This jug's of use because one can pour water
into it."
This pencil's of use because you can write anything with it.
But that woman's face is inferior to any face in nature.
"Try drawing
an apple, and put a real apple beside it."
Which would you take?
"You
wouldn't make a mistake, I'm sure."
"This is what all our theories amount
to, now that the first light of free investigation has dawned upon
them."""
"""Indeed, indeed."""
"""You laugh ironically."
And what used you to say to me about charity?
"Yet the enjoyment derived from charity is a haughty and immoral
enjoyment."
"The rich man's enjoyment in his wealth, his power, and in the
comparison of his importance with the poor."
"Charity corrupts giver and
taker alike; and, what's more, does not attain its object, as it
only increases poverty."
"Fathers who don't want to work crowd round the
charitable like gamblers round the gambling-table, hoping for gain,
while the pitiful farthings that are flung them are a hundred times too
little."
Have you given away much in your life?
"Less than a rouble, if
you try and think."
"Try to remember when last you gave away anything;
it'll be two years ago, maybe four."
"You make an outcry and only hinder
things."
"Charity ought to be forbidden by law, even in the present state
of society."
"In the new regime there will be no poor at all."""
"""Oh, what an eruption of borrowed phrases!"
"So it's come to the new
regime already?"
"Unhappy woman, God help you!"""
"""Yes; it has, Stepan Trofimovitch."
"You carefully concealed all these new
ideas from me, though every one's familiar with them nowadays."
"And you
did it simply out of jealousy, so as to have power over me."
"So that now
even that Yulia is a hundred miles ahead of me."
"But now my eyes have
been opened."
"I have defended you, Stepan Trofimovitch, all I could, but
there is no one who does not blame you."""
"""Enough!"""
"said he, getting up from his seat."
"""Enough!"
"And what can I
wish you now, unless it's repentance?"""
"""Sit still a minute, Stepan Trofimovitch."
"I have another question to ask
you."
You've been told of the invitation to read at the literary matinée.
It was arranged through me.
"Tell me what you're going to read?"""
"""Why, about that very Queen of Queens, that ideal of humanity, the
Sistine Madonna, who to your thinking is inferior to a glass or a
pencil."""
"""So you're not taking something historical?'"""
"said Varvara Petrovna
in mournful surprise."
"""But they won't listen to you."
"You've got that
Madonna on your brain."
You seem bent on putting every one to sleep!
"Let
me assure you, Stepan Trofimovitch, I am speaking entirely in your own
interest."
"It would be a different matter if you would take some short
but interesting story of mediæval court life from Spanish history, or,
better still, some anecdote, and pad it out with other anecdotes and
witty phrases of your own."
"There were magnificent courts then; ladies,
you know, poisonings."
"Karmazinov says it would be strange if you
couldn't read something interesting from Spanish history."""
"""Karmazinov--that fool who has written himself out--looking for a
subject for me!"""
"""Karmazinov, that almost imperial intellect."
"You are too free in your
language, Stepan Trofimovitch."""
"""Your Karmazinov is a spiteful old woman whose day is over."
"_Chère,
chère,_ how long have you been so enslaved by them?"
"Oh God!"""
"""I can't endure him even now for the airs he gives himself."
"But I do
justice to his intellect."
"I repeat, I have done my best to defend you
as far as I could."
And why do you insist on being absurd and tedious?
"On the contrary, come on to the platform with a dignified smile as
the representative of the last generation, and tell them two or three
anecdotes in your witty way, as only you can tell things sometimes."
"Though you may be an old man now, though you may belong to a past age,
though you may have dropped behind them, in fact, yet you'll recognise
it yourself, with a smile, in your preface, and all will see that you're
an amiable, good-natured, witty relic... in brief, a man of the old
savour, and so far advanced as to be capable of appreciating at their
value all the absurdities of certain ideas which you have hitherto
followed."
"Come, as a favour to me, I beg you."""
"""_Chère,_ enough."
Don't ask me.
I can't.
"I shall speak of the Madonna,
but I shall raise a storm that will either crush them all or shatter me
alone."""
"""It will certainly be you alone, Stepan Trofimovitch."""
"""Such is my fate."
"I will speak of the contemptible slave, of the
stinking, depraved flunkey who will first climb a ladder with scissors
in his hands, and slash to pieces the divine image of the great ideal,
in the name of equality, envy, and... digestion."
"Let my curse thunder
out upon them, and then--then...""

""The madhouse?"""
"""Perhaps."
"But in any case, whether I shall be left vanquished or
victorious, that very evening I shall take my bag, my beggar's bag."
"I shall leave all my goods and chattels, all your presents, all your
pensions and promises of future benefits, and go forth on foot to end my
life a tutor in a merchant's family or to die somewhere of hunger in a
ditch."
I have said it.
"_Alea jacta est._"" He got up again."
"""I've been convinced for years,"" said Varvara Petrovna, getting up with
flashing eyes, ""that your only object in life is to put me and my house
to shame by your calumnies!"
"What do you mean by being a tutor in a
merchant's family or dying in a ditch?"
"It's spite, calumny, and nothing
more."""
"""You have always despised me."
"But I will end like a knight, faithful to
my lady."
"Your good opinion has always been dearer to me than
anything."
"From this moment I will take nothing, but will worship you
disinterestedly."""
"""How stupid that is!"""
"""You have never respected me."
I may have had a mass of weaknesses.
"Yes,
I have sponged on you."
"I speak the language of nihilism, but sponging
has never been the guiding motive of my action."
"It has happened so
of itself."
I don't know how....
"I always imagined there was something
higher than meat and drink between us, and--I've never, never been a
scoundrel!"
"And so, to take the open road, to set things right."
"I set
off late, late autumn out of doors, the mist lies over the fields, the
hoarfrost of old age covers the road before me, and the wind howls about
the approaching grave...."
"But so forward, forward, on my new way

     'Filled with purest love and fervour,
     Faith which my sweet dream did yield.'"
"Oh, my dreams."
Farewell.
Twenty years.
"_Alea jacta est!_""

His face was wet with a sudden gush of tears."
He took his hat.
"""I don't understand Latin,"" said Varvara Petrovna, doing her best to
control herself."
"Who knows, perhaps, she too felt like crying."
"But caprice and
indignation once more got the upper hand."
"""I know only one thing, that all this is childish nonsense."
"You will
never be capable of carrying out your threats, which are a mass of
egoism."
"You will set off nowhere, to no merchant; you'll end very
peaceably on my hands, taking your pension, and receiving your utterly
impossible friends on Tuesdays."
"Good-bye, Stepan Trofimovitch."""
"_""Alea jacta est!"
"""_ He made her a deep bow, and returned home, almost
dead with emotion."
CHAPTER VI.
"PYOTR STEPANOVITCH IS BUSY


I

The date of the fête was definitely fixed, and Von Lembke became more
and more depressed."
"He was full of strange and sinister forebodings,
and this made Yulia Mihailovna seriously uneasy."
"Indeed, things were not
altogether satisfactory."
"Our mild governor had left the affairs of the
province a little out of gear; at the moment we were threatened with
cholera; serious outbreaks of cattle plague had appeared in several
places; fires were prevalent that summer in towns and villages; whilst
among the peasantry foolish rumours of incendiarism grew stronger and
stronger."
Cases of robbery were twice as numerous as usual.
"But all
this, of course, would have been perfectly ordinary had there been
no other and more weighty reasons to disturb the equanimity of Andrey
Antonovitch, who had till then been in good spirits."
"What struck Yulia Mihailovna most of all was that he became more silent
and, strange to say, more secretive every day."
"Yet it was hard to
imagine what he had to hide."
"It is true that he rarely opposed her and
as a rule followed her lead without question."
"At her instigation, for
instance, two or three regulations of a risky and hardly legal character
were introduced with the object of strengthening the authority of the
governor."
"There were several ominous instances of transgressions being
condoned with the same end in view; persons who deserved to be sent to
prison and Siberia were, solely because she insisted, recommended
for promotion."
"Certain complaints and inquiries were deliberately and
systematically ignored."
All this came out later on.
"Not only did Lembke
sign everything, but he did not even go into the question of the share
taken by his wife in the execution of his duties."
"On the other hand, he
began at times to be restive about ""the most trifling matters,"" to the
surprise of Yulia Mihailovna."
"No doubt he felt the need to make up for
the days of suppression by brief moments of mutiny."
"Unluckily,
Yulia Mihailovna was unable, for all her insight, to understand this
honourable punctiliousness in an honourable character."
"Alas, she had
no thought to spare for that, and that was the source of many
misunderstandings."
"There are some things of which it is not suitable for me to write, and
indeed I am not in a position to do so."
"It is not my business to discuss
the blunders of administration either, and I prefer to leave out this
administrative aspect of the subject altogether."
"In the chronicle I have
begun I've set before myself a different task."
"Moreover a great deal
will be brought to light by the Commission of Inquiry which has just
been appointed for our province; it's only a matter of waiting a little."
"Certain explanations, however, cannot be omitted."
But to return to Yulia Mihailovna.
"The poor lady (I feel very sorry for
her) might have attained all that attracted and allured her (renown and
so on) without any such violent and eccentric actions as she resolved
upon at the very first step."
"But either from an exaggerated passion for
the romantic or from the frequently blighted hopes of her youth, she
felt suddenly, at the change of her fortunes, that she had become one of
the specially elect, almost God's anointed, ""over whom there gleamed a
burning tongue of fire,"" and this tongue of flame was the root of the
mischief, for, after all, it is not like a chignon, which will fit any
woman's head."
"But there is nothing of which it is more difficult to
convince a woman than of this; on the contrary, anyone who cares to
encourage the delusion in her will always be sure to meet with success."
"And people vied with one another in encouraging the delusion in Yulia
Mihailovna."
"The poor woman became at once the sport of conflicting
influences, while fully persuaded of her own originality."
"Many clever
people feathered their nests and took advantage of her simplicity during
the brief period of her rule in the province."
"And what a jumble there
was under this assumption of independence!"
"She was fascinated at the
same time by the aristocratic element and the system of big landed
properties and the increase of the governor's power, and the democratic
element, and the new reforms and discipline, and free-thinking and stray
Socialistic notions, and the correct tone of the aristocratic salon and
the free-and-easy, almost pot-house, manners of the young people that
surrounded her."
"She dreamed of ""giving happiness"" and reconciling
the irreconcilable, or, rather, of uniting all and everything in
the adoration of her own person."
"She had favourites too; she was
particularly fond of Pyotr Stepanovitch, who had recourse at times to
the grossest flattery in dealing with her."
"But she was attracted by him
for another reason, an amazing one, and most characteristic of the
poor lady: she was always hoping that he would reveal to her a regular
conspiracy against the government."
"Difficult as it is to imagine such
a thing, it really was the case."
"She fancied for some reason that there
must be a nihilist plot concealed in the province."
"By his silence at one
time and his hints at another Pyotr Stepanovitch did much to strengthen
this strange idea in her."
"She imagined that he was in communication with
every revolutionary element in Russia but at the same time passionately
devoted to her."
"To discover the plot, to receive the gratitude of the
government, to enter on a brilliant career, to influence the young ""by
kindness,"" and to restrain them from extremes--all these dreams existed
side by side in her fantastic brain."
"She had saved Pyotr Stepanovitch,
she had conquered him (of this she was for some reason firmly
convinced); she would save others."
"None, none of them should perish,
she should save them all; she would pick them out; she would send in
the right report of them; she would act in the interests of the loftiest
justice, and perhaps posterity and Russian liberalism would bless her
name; yet the conspiracy would be discovered."
Every advantage at once.
"Still it was essential that Andrey Antonovitch should be in rather
better spirits before the festival."
He must be cheered up and reassured.
"For this purpose she sent Pyotr Stepanovitch to him in the hope that he
would relieve his depression by some means of consolation best known
to himself, perhaps by giving him some information, so to speak, first
hand."
She put implicit faith in his dexterity.
"It was some time since Pyotr Stepanovitch had been in Mr. von Lembke's
study."
"He popped in on him just when the sufferer was in a most stubborn
mood."
"II

A combination of circumstances had arisen which Mr. von Lembke was quite
unable to deal with."
"In the very district where Pyotr Stepanovitch had
been having a festive time a sub-lieutenant had been called up to be
censured by his immediate superior, and the reproof was given in the
presence of the whole company."
"The sub-lieutenant was a young man fresh
from Petersburg, always silent and morose, of dignified appearance
though small, stout, and rosy-cheeked."
"He resented the reprimand and
suddenly, with a startling shriek that astonished the whole company,
he charged at his superior officer with his head bent down like a wild
beast's, struck him, and bit him on the shoulder with all his might;
they had difficulty in getting him off."
"There was no doubt that he had
gone out of his mind; anyway, it became known that of late he had been
observed performing incredibly strange actions."
"He had, for instance,
flung two ikons belonging to his landlady out of his lodgings and
smashed up one of them with an axe; in his own room he had, on three
stands resembling lecterns, laid out the works of Vogt, Moleschott, and
Buchner, and before each lectern he used to burn a church wax-candle."
"From the number of books found in his rooms it could be gathered that
he was a well-read man."
"If he had had fifty thousand francs he would
perhaps have sailed to the island of Marquisas like the ""cadet"" to whom
Herzen alludes with such sprightly humour in one of his writings."
"When
he was seized, whole bundles of the most desperate manifestoes were
found in his pockets and his lodgings."
"Manifestoes are a trivial matter too, and to my thinking not worth
troubling about."
We have seen plenty of them.
"Besides, they were not
new manifestoes; they were, it was said later, just the same as had been
circulated in the X province, and Liputin, who had travelled in that
district and the neighbouring province six weeks previously, declared
that he had seen exactly the same leaflets there then."
"But what struck
Andrey Antonovitch most was that the overseer of Shpigulin's factory had
brought the police just at the same time two or three packets of exactly
the same leaflets as had been found on the lieutenant."
"The bundles,
which had been dropped in the factory in the night, had not been opened,
and none of the factory-hands had had time to read one of them."
"The
incident was a trivial one, but it set Andrey Antonovitch pondering
deeply."
"The position presented itself to him in an unpleasantly
complicated light."
"In this factory the famous ""Shpigulin scandal"" was just then brewing,
which made so much talk among us and got into the Petersburg and Moscow
papers with all sorts of variations."
"Three weeks previously one of the
hands had fallen ill and died of Asiatic cholera; then several others
were stricken down."
"The whole town was in a panic, for the cholera was
coming nearer and nearer and had reached the neighbouring province."
"I may observe that satisfactory sanitary measures had been, so far as
possible, taken to meet the unexpected guest."
"But the factory belonging
to the Shpigulins, who were millionaires and well-connected people, had
somehow been overlooked."
"And there was a sudden outcry from every one
that this factory was the hot-bed of infection, that the factory
itself, and especially the quarters inhabited by the workpeople, were
so inveterately filthy that even if cholera had not been in the
neighbourhood there might well have been an outbreak there."
"Steps were
immediately taken, of course, and Andrey Antonovitch vigorously insisted
on their being carried out without delay within three weeks."
"The factory
was cleansed, but the Shpigulins, for some unknown reason, closed it."
"One of the Shpigulin brothers always lived in Petersburg and the other
went away to Moscow when the order was given for cleansing the factory."
"The overseer proceeded to pay off the workpeople and, as it appeared,
cheated them shamelessly."
"The hands began to complain among themselves,
asking to be paid fairly, and foolishly went to the police, though
without much disturbance, for they were not so very much excited."
"It
was just at this moment that the manifestoes were brought to Andrey
Antonovitch by the overseer."
"Pyotr Stepanovitch popped into the study unannounced, like an intimate
friend and one of the family; besides, he had a message from Yulia
Mihailovna."
"Seeing him, Lembke frowned grimly and stood still at the
table without welcoming him."
"Till that moment he had been pacing up and
down the study and had been discussing something _tête-à-tête_ with his
clerk Blum, a very clumsy and surly German whom he had brought with him
from Petersburg, in spite of the violent opposition of Yulia Mihailovna."
"On Pyotr Stepanovitch's entrance the clerk had moved to the door, but
had not gone out."
"Pyotr Stepanovitch even fancied that he exchanged
significant glances with his chief."
"""Aha, I've caught you at last, you secretive monarch of the town!"""
"Pyotr
Stepanovitch cried out laughing, and laid his hand over the manifesto on
the table."
"""This increases your collection, eh?"""
Andrey Antonovitch flushed crimson; his face seemed to twitch.
"""Leave off, leave off at once!"""
"he cried, trembling with rage."
"""And
don't you dare... sir...""

""What's the matter with you?"
"You seem to be angry!"""
"""Allow me to inform you, sir, that I've no intention of putting up with
your _sans façon_ henceforward, and I beg you to remember...""

""Why, damn it all, he is in earnest!"""
"""Hold your tongue, hold your tongue""--Von Lembke stamped on the
carpet--""and don't dare...""

God knows what it might have come to."
"Alas, there was one circumstance
involved in the matter of which neither Pyotr Stepanovitch nor even
Yulia Mihailovna herself had any idea."
"The luckless Andrey Antonovitch
had been so greatly upset during the last few days that he had begun
to be secretly jealous of his wife and Pyotr Stepanovitch."
"In solitude,
especially at night, he spent some very disagreeable moments."
"""Well, I imagined that if a man reads you his novel two days running
till after midnight and wants to hear your opinion of it, he has of his
own act discarded official relations, anyway.... Yulia Mihailovna treats
me as a friend; there's no making you out,"" Pyotr Stepanovitch brought
out, with a certain dignity indeed."
"""Here is your novel, by the way."""
"He
laid on the table a large heavy manuscript rolled up in blue paper."
Lembke turned red and looked embarrassed.
"""Where did you find it?"""
"he asked discreetly, with a rush of joy which
he was unable to suppress, though he did his utmost to conceal it."
"""Only fancy, done up like this, it rolled under the chest of drawers."
"I
must have thrown it down carelessly on the chest when I went out."
"It was
only found the day before yesterday, when the floor was scrubbed."
"You
did set me a task, though!"""
Lembke dropped his eyes sternly.
"""I haven't slept for the last two nights, thanks to you."
"It was found
the day before yesterday, but I kept it, and have been reading it ever
since."
"I've no time in the day, so I've read it at night."
"Well, I don't
like it; it's not my way of looking at things."
"But that's no matter;
I've never set up for being a critic, but I couldn't tear myself away
from it, my dear man, though I didn't like it!"
"The fourth and fifth
chapters are... they really are... damn it all, they are beyond words!"
And what a lot of humour you've packed into it; it made me laugh!
"How
you can make fun of things _sans que cela paraisse!_ As for the ninth
and tenth chapters, it's all about love; that's not my line, but it's
effective though."
"I was nearly blubbering over Egrenev's letter, though
you've shown him up so cleverly.... You know, it's touching, though at
the same time you want to show the false side of him, as it were, don't
you?"
Have I guessed right?
But I could simply beat you for the ending.
For what are you setting up?
"Why, the same old idol of domestic
happiness, begetting children and making money; 'they were married and
lived happy ever afterwards'--come, it's too much!"
"You will enchant your
readers, for even I couldn't put the book down; but that makes it all
the worse!"
"The reading public is as stupid as ever, but it's the duty
of sensible people to wake them up, while you..."
But that's enough.
Good-bye.
"Don't be cross another time; I came in to you because I had a
couple of words to say to you, but you are so unaccountable...""

Andrey Antonovitch meantime took his novel and locked it up in an oak
bookcase, seizing the opportunity to wink to Blum to disappear."
"The
latter withdrew with a long, mournful face."
"""I am not unaccountable, I am simply... nothing but annoyances,"" he
muttered, frowning but without anger, and sitting down to the table."
"""Sit down and say what you have to say."
"It's a long time since I've seen
you, Pyotr Stepanovitch, only don't burst upon me in the future with
such manners... sometimes, when one has business, it's...""

""My manners are always the same....""

""I know, and I believe that you mean nothing by it, but sometimes one is
worried...."
"Sit down."""
"Pyotr Stepanovitch immediately lolled back on the sofa and drew his legs
under him."
"III

""What sort of worries?"
"Surely not these trifles?"""
"He nodded towards the
manifesto."
"""I can bring you as many of them as you like; I made their
acquaintance in X province."""
"""You mean at the time you were staying there?"""
"""Of course, it was not in my absence."
"I remember there was a hatchet
printed at the top of it."
"Allow me."""
(He took up the manifesto.)
"""Yes,
there's the hatchet here too; that's it, the very same."""
"""Yes, here's a hatchet."
"You see, a hatchet."""
"""Well, is it the hatchet that scares you?"""
"""No, it's not... and I am not scared; but this business... it is a
business; there are circumstances."""
"""What sort?"
That it's come from the factory?
He he!
"But do you know,
at that factory the workpeople will soon be writing manifestoes for
themselves."""
"""What do you mean?"""
Von Lembke stared at him severely.
"""What I say."
You've only to look at them.
"You are too soft, Andrey
Antonovitch; you write novels."
"But this has to be handled in the good
old way."""
"""What do you mean by the good old way?"
What do you mean by advising me?
"The factory has been cleaned; I gave the order and they've cleaned it."""
"""And the workmen are in rebellion."
"They ought to be flogged, every one
of them; that would be the end of it."""
"""In rebellion?"
"That's nonsense; I gave the order and they've cleaned
it."""
"""Ech, you are soft, Andrey Antonovitch!"""
"""In the first place, I am not so soft as you think, and in the second
place..."" Von Lembke was piqued again."
"He had exerted himself to keep
up the conversation with the young man from curiosity, wondering if he
would tell him anything new."
"""Ha ha, an old acquaintance again,"" Pyotr Stepanovitch interrupted,
pouncing on another document that lay under a paper-weight, something
like a manifesto, obviously printed abroad and in verse."
"""Oh, come, I
know this one by heart, 'A Noble Personality.'"
"Let me have a look at
it--yes, 'A Noble Personality' it is."
"I made acquaintance with that
personality abroad."
"Where did you unearth it?"""
"""You say you've seen it abroad?"""
Von Lembke said eagerly.
"""I should think so, four months ago, or may be five."""
"""You seem to have seen a great deal abroad."""
"Von Lembke looked at him
subtly."
"Pyotr Stepanovitch, not heeding him, unfolded the document and read the
poem aloud:

""A NOBLE PERSONALITY

     ""He was not of rank exalted,
     He was not of noble birth,
     He was bred among the people
     In the breast of Mother Earth."
"But the malice of the nobles
     And the Tsar's revengeful wrath
     Drove him forth to grief and torture
     On the martyr's chosen path."
"He set out to teach the people
     Freedom, love, equality,
     To exhort them to resistance;
     But to flee the penalty
     Of the prison, whip and gallows,
     To a foreign land he went."
"While the people waited hoping
     From Smolensk to far Tashkent,
     Waited eager for his coming
     To rebel against their fate,
     To arise and crush the Tsardom
     And the nobles' vicious hate,
     To share all the wealth in common,
     And the antiquated thrall
     Of the church, the home and marriage
     To abolish once for all."""
"""You got it from that officer, I suppose, eh?"""
asked Pyotr Stepanovitch.
"""Why, do you know that officer, then, too?"""
"""I should think so."
"I had a gay time with him there for two days; he was
bound to go out of his mind."""
"""Perhaps he did not go out of his mind."""
"""You think he didn't because he began to bite?"""
"""But, excuse me, if you saw those verses abroad and then, it appears, at
that officer's...""

""What, puzzling, is it?"
"You are putting me through an examination,
Andrey Antonovitch, I see."
"You see,"" he began suddenly with
extraordinary dignity, ""as to what I saw abroad I have already given
explanations, and my explanations were found satisfactory, otherwise I
should not have been gratifying this town with my presence."
"I consider
that the question as regards me has been settled, and I am not obliged
to give any further account of myself, not because I am an informer, but
because I could not help acting as I did."
"The people who wrote to Yulia
Mihailovna about me knew what they were talking about, and they said I
was an honest man...."
"But that's neither here nor there; I've come
to see you about a serious matter, and it's as well you've sent
your chimney-sweep away."
"It's a matter of importance to me, Andrey
Antonovitch."
"I shall have a very great favour to ask of you."""
"""A favour?"
"H'm... by all means; I am waiting and, I confess, with
curiosity."
"And I must add, Pyotr Stepanovitch, that you surprise me not
a little."""
Von Lembke was in some agitation.
Pyotr Stepanovitch crossed his legs.
"""In Petersburg,"" he began, ""I talked freely of most things, but there
were things--this, for instance"" (he tapped the ""Noble Personality"" with
his finger) ""about which I held my tongue--in the first place, because
it wasn't worth talking about, and secondly, because I only answered
questions."
"I don't care to put myself forward in such matters; in that
I see the distinction between a rogue and an honest man forced by
circumstances."
"Well, in short, we'll dismiss that."
"But now... now that
these fools... now that this has come to the surface and is in your
hands, and I see that you'll find out all about it--for you are a man
with eyes and one can't tell beforehand what you'll do--and these fools
are still going on, I..."
"I... well, the fact is, I've come to ask you
to save one man, a fool too, most likely mad, for the sake of his youth,
his misfortunes, in the name of your humanity.... You can't be so humane
only in the novels you manufacture!"""
"he said, breaking off with coarse
sarcasm and impatience."
"In fact, he was seen to be a straightforward man, awkward and
impolitic from excess of humane feeling and perhaps from excessive
sensitiveness--above all, a man of limited intelligence, as Von Lembke
saw at once with extraordinary subtlety."
"He had indeed long suspected
it, especially when during the previous week he had, sitting alone
in his study at night, secretly cursed him with all his heart for the
inexplicable way in which he had gained Yulia Mihailovna's good graces."
"""For whom are you interceding, and what does all this mean?"""
"he inquired
majestically, trying to conceal his curiosity."
"""It... it's... damn it!"
It's not my fault that I trust you!
"Is it
my fault that I look upon you as a most honourable and, above all, a
sensible man... capable, that is, of understanding... damn...""

The poor fellow evidently could not master his emotion."
"""You must understand at last,"" he went on, ""you must understand that in
pronouncing his name I am betraying him to you--I am betraying him, am I
not?"
"I am, am I not?"""
"""But how am I to guess if you don't make up your mind to speak out?"""
"""That's just it; you always cut the ground from under one's feet with
your logic, damn it.... Well, here goes... this 'noble personality,'
this 'student'... is Shatov... that's all."""
"""Shatov?"
"How do you mean it's Shatov?"""
"""Shatov is the 'student' who is mentioned in this."
"He lives here, he was
once a serf, the man who gave that slap....""

""I know, I know."""
Lembke screwed up his eyes.
"""But excuse me, what is he
accused of?"
"Precisely and, above all, what is your petition?"""
"""I beg you to save him, do you understand?"
"I used to know him
eight years ago, I might almost say I was his friend,"" cried Pyotr
Stepanovitch, completely carried away."
"""But I am not bound to give you
an account of my past life,"" he added, with a gesture of dismissal."
"""All
this is of no consequence; it's the case of three men and a half, and
with those that are abroad you can't make up a dozen."
"But what I
am building upon is your humanity and your intelligence."
"You will
understand and you will put the matter in its true light, as the foolish
dream of a man driven crazy... by misfortunes, by continued misfortunes,
and not as some impossible political plot or God knows what!"""
He was almost gasping for breath.
"""H'm."
"I see that he is responsible for the manifestoes with the axe,""
Lembke concluded almost majestically."
"""Excuse me, though, if he were the
only person concerned, how could he have distributed it both here and
in other districts and in the X province... and, above all, where did he
get them?"""
"""But I tell you that at the utmost there are not more than five people
in it--a dozen perhaps."
"How can I tell?"""
"""You don't know?"""
"""How should I know?--damn it all."""
"""Why, you knew that Shatov was one of the conspirators."""
"""Ech!"""
"Pyotr Stepanovitch waved his hand as though to keep off the
overwhelming penetration of the inquirer."
"""Well, listen."
"I'll tell you
the whole truth: of the manifestoes I know nothing--that is, absolutely
nothing."
"Damn it all, don't you know what nothing means?..."
"That
sub-lieutenant, to be sure, and somebody else and someone else here...
and Shatov perhaps and someone else too--well, that's the lot of
them... a wretched lot...."
But I've come to intercede for Shatov.
"He
must be saved, for this poem is his, his own composition, and it was
through him it was published abroad; that I know for a fact, but of the
manifestoes I really know nothing."""
"""If the poem is his work, no doubt the manifestoes are too."
"But what
data have you for suspecting Mr."
"Shatov?"""
"Pyotr Stepanovitch, with the air of a man driven out of all patience,
pulled a pocket-book out of his pocket and took a note out of it."
"""Here are the facts,"" he cried, flinging it on the table."
"Lembke unfolded it; it turned out to be a note written six months before
from here to some address abroad."
"It was a brief note, only two lines:

""I can't print 'A Noble Personality' here, and in fact I can do nothing;
print it abroad."
"""Iv."
"Shatov."""
Lembke looked intently at Pyotr Stepanovitch.
"Varvara Petrovna had been
right in saying that he had at times the expression of a sheep."
"""You see, it's like this,"" Pyotr Stepanovitch burst out."
"""He wrote this
poem here six months ago, but he couldn't get it printed here, in a
secret printing press, and so he asks to have it printed abroad.... That
seems clear."""
"""Yes, that's clear, but to whom did he write?"
"That's not clear yet,""
Lembke observed with the most subtle irony."
"""Why, Kirillov, of course; the letter was written to Kirillov
abroad...."
Surely you knew that?
"What's so annoying is that perhaps you
are only putting it on before me, and most likely you knew all about
this poem and everything long ago!"
How did it come to be on your table?
It found its way there somehow!
"Why are you torturing me, if so?"""
He feverishly mopped his forehead with his handkerchief.
"""I know something, perhaps."""
Lembke parried dexterously.
"""But who is
this Kirillov?"""
"""An engineer who has lately come to the town."
"He was Stavrogin's second,
a maniac, a madman; your sub-lieutenant may really only be
suffering from temporary delirium, but Kirillov is a thoroughgoing
madman--thoroughgoing, that I guarantee."
"Ah, Andrey Antonovitch, if the
government only knew what sort of people these conspirators all are,
they wouldn't have the heart to lay a finger on them."
"Every single
one of them ought to be in an asylum; I had a good look at them in
Switzerland and at the congresses."""
"""From which they direct the movement here?"""
"""Why, who directs it?"
Three men and a half.
"It makes one sick to think
of them."
And what sort of movement is there here?
Manifestoes!
"And what
recruits have they made?"
"Sub-lieutenants in brain fever and two or three
students!"
You are a sensible man: answer this question.
"Why don't
people of consequence join their ranks?"
"Why are they all students and
half-baked boys of twenty-two?"
And not many of those.
"I dare say there
are thousands of bloodhounds on their track, but have they tracked out
many of them?"
Seven!
"I tell you it makes one sick."""
"Lembke listened with attention but with an expression that seemed to
say, ""You don't feed nightingales on fairy-tales."""
"""Excuse me, though."
"You asserted that the letter was sent abroad, but
there's no address on it; how do you come to know that it was addressed
to Mr. Kirillov and abroad too and... and... that it really was written
by Mr."
"Shatov?"""
"""Why, fetch some specimen of Shatov's writing and compare it."
"You must
have some signature of his in your office."
"As for its being addressed to
Kirillov, it was Kirillov himself showed it me at the time."""
"""Then you were yourself...""

""Of course I was, myself."
They showed me lots of things out there.
"And
as for this poem, they say it was written by Herzen to Shatov when he
was still wandering abroad, in memory of their meeting, so they say, by
way of praise and recommendation--damn it all... and Shatov circulates
it among the young people as much as to say, 'This was Herzen's opinion
of me.'"""
"""Ha ha!"""
"cried Lembke, feeling he had got to the bottom of it at last."
"""That's just what I was wondering: one can understand the manifesto, but
what's the object of the poem?"""
"""Of course you'd see it."
Goodness knows why I've been babbling to you.
Listen.
"Spare Shatov for me and the rest may go to the devil--even
Kirillov, who is in hiding now, shut up in Filipov's house, where Shatov
lodges too."
"They don't like me because I've turned round... but promise
me Shatov and I'll dish them all up for you."
"I shall be of use, Andrey
Antonovitch!"
I reckon nine or ten men make up the whole wretched lot.
"I
am keeping an eye on them myself, on my own account."
"We know of three
already: Shatov, Kirillov, and that sub-lieutenant."
"The others I am only
watching carefully... though I am pretty sharp-sighted too."
"It's the
same over again as it was in the X province: two students, a schoolboy,
two noblemen of twenty, a teacher, and a half-pay major of sixty, crazy
with drink, have been caught with manifestoes; that was all--you can
take my word for it, that was all; it was quite a surprise that that
was all."
But I must have six days.
"I have reckoned it out--six days, not
less."
"If you want to arrive at any result, don't disturb them for six
days and I can kill all the birds with one stone for you; but if you
flutter them before, the birds will fly away."
But spare me Shatov.
"I
speak for Shatov...."
"The best plan would be to fetch him here secretly,
in a friendly way, to your study and question him without disguising
the facts...."
"I have no doubt he'll throw himself at your feet and burst
into tears!"
"He is a highly strung and unfortunate fellow; his wife
is carrying on with Stavrogin."
"Be kind to him and he will tell you
everything, but I must have six days.... And, above all, above all, not
a word to Yulia Mihailovna."
It's a secret.
"May it be a secret?"""
"""What?"""
"cried Lembke, opening wide his eyes."
"""Do you mean to say you
said nothing of this to Yulia Mihailovna?"""
"""To her?"
Heaven forbid!
"Ech, Andrey Antonovitch!"
"You see, I value her
friendship and I have the highest respect for her... and all the rest of
it... but I couldn't make such a blunder."
"I don't contradict her, for,
as you know yourself, it's dangerous to contradict her."
"I may have
dropped a word to her, for I know she likes that, but to suppose that
I mentioned names to her as I have to you or anything of that sort!"
"My
good sir!"
Why am I appealing to you?
"Because you are a man, anyway,
a serious person with old-fashioned firmness and experience in the
service."
You've seen life.
"You must know by heart every detail of such
affairs, I expect, from what you've seen in Petersburg."
"But if I were
to mention those two names, for instance, to her, she'd stir up such a
hubbub.... You know, she would like to astonish Petersburg."
"No, she's
too hot-headed, she really is."""
"""Yes, she has something of that _fougue,_"" Andrey Antonovitch muttered
with some satisfaction, though at the same time he resented this
unmannerly fellow's daring to express himself rather freely about Yulia
Mihailovna."
"But Pyotr Stepanovitch probably imagined that he had not
gone far enough and that he must exert himself further to flatter Lembke
and make a complete conquest of him."
"""_Fougue_ is just it,"" he assented."
"""She may be a woman of genius, a
literary woman, but she would scare our sparrows."
"She wouldn't be
able to keep quiet for six hours, let alone six days."
"Ech, Andrey
Antonovitch, don't attempt to tie a woman down for six days!"
"You do
admit that I have some experience--in this sort of thing, I mean; I know
something about it, and you know that I may very well know something
about it."
"I am not asking for six days for fun but with an object."""
"""I have heard..."" (Lembke hesitated to utter his thought) ""I have heard
that on your return from abroad you made some expression... as it were
of repentance, in the proper quarter?"""
"""Well, that's as it may be."""
"""And, of course, I don't want to go into it...."
"But it has seemed to
me all along that you've talked in quite a different style--about the
Christian faith, for instance, about social institutions, about the
government even....""

""I've said lots of things, no doubt, I am saying them still; but such
ideas mustn't be applied as those fools do it, that's the point."
"What's
the good of biting his superior's shoulder!"
"You agreed with me yourself,
only you said it was premature."""
"""I didn't mean that when I agreed and said it was premature."""
"""You weigh every word you utter, though."
He he!
"You are a careful man!"""
Pyotr Stepanovitch observed gaily all of a sudden.
"""Listen, old friend."
I had to get to know you; that's why I talked in my own style.
"You are
not the only one I get to know like that."
"Maybe I needed to find out
your character."""
"""What's my character to you?"""
"""How can I tell what it may be to me?"""
He laughed again.
"""You see, my
dear and highly respected Andrey Antonovitch, you are cunning, but
it's not come to _that_ yet and it certainly never will come to it, you
understand?"
Perhaps you do understand.
"Though I did make an explanation
in the proper quarter when I came back from abroad, and I really don't
know why a man of certain convictions should not be able to work for
the advancement of his sincere convictions... but nobody _there_ has yet
instructed me to investigate your character and I've not undertaken any
such job from _them._ Consider: I need not have given those two names to
you."
"I might have gone straight _there;_ that is where I made my first
explanations."
"And if I'd been acting with a view to financial profit or
my own interest in any way, it would have been a bad speculation on my
part, for now they'll be grateful to you and not to me at headquarters."
"I've done it solely for Shatov's sake,"" Pyotr Stepanovitch added
generously, ""for Shatov's sake, because of our old friendship...."
"But
when you take up your pen to write to headquarters, you may put in
a word for me, if you like...."
"I'll make no objection, he he!"
"_Adieu,_
though; I've stayed too long and there was no need to gossip so much!"""
"he added with some amiability, and he got up from the sofa."
"""On the contrary, I am very glad that the position has been defined, so
to speak."""
"Von Lembke too got up and he too looked pleasant, obviously
affected by the last words."
"""I accept your services and acknowledge
my obligation, and you may be sure that anything I can do by way of
reporting your zeal...""

""Six days--the great thing is to put it off for six days, and that you
shouldn't stir for those six days, that's what I want."""
"""So be it."""
"""Of course, I don't tie your hands and shouldn't venture to."
"You are
bound to keep watch, only don't flutter the nest too soon; I rely on
your sense and experience for that."
"But I should think you've plenty
of bloodhounds and trackers of your own in reserve, ha ha!"""
"Pyotr
Stepanovitch blurted out with the gaiety and irresponsibility of youth."
"""Not quite so."""
Lembke parried amiably.
"""Young people are apt to suppose
that there is a great deal in the background...."
"But, by the way, allow
me one little word: if this Kirillov was Stavrogin's second, then Mr.
Stavrogin too...""

""What about Stavrogin?"""
"""I mean, if they are such friends?"""
"""Oh, no, no, no!"
"There you are quite out of it, though you are cunning."
You really surprise me.
"I thought that you had some information about
it.... H'm... Stavrogin--it's quite the opposite, quite.... _Avis au
lecteur."
"""_

""Do you mean it?"
"And can it be so?"""
Lembke articulated mistrustfully.
"""Yulia Mihailovna told me that from what she heard from Petersburg he is
a man acting on some sort of instructions, so to speak....""

""I know nothing about it; I know nothing, absolutely nothing."
_Adieu.
"Avis au lecteur!_"" Abruptly and obviously Pyotr Stepanovitch declined to
discuss it."
He hurried to the door.
"""Stay, Pyotr Stepanovitch, stay,"" cried Lembke."
"""One other tiny matter
and I won't detain you."""
He drew an envelope out of a table drawer.
"""Here is a little specimen of the same kind of thing, and I let you see
it to show how completely I trust you."
"Here, and tell me your opinion."""
"In the envelope was a letter, a strange anonymous letter addressed to
Lembke and only received by him the day before."
"With intense vexation
Pyotr Stepanovitch read as follows:

""Your excellency,--For such you are by rank."
"Herewith I make known that
there is an attempt to be made on the life of personages of general's
rank and on the Fatherland."
For it's working up straight for that.
I myself have been disseminating unceasingly for a number of years.
There's infidelity too.
"There's a rebellion being got up and there are
some thousands of manifestoes, and for every one of them there will be
a hundred running with their tongues out, unless they've been taken
away beforehand by the police."
"For they've been promised a mighty lot of
benefits, and the simple people are foolish, and there's vodka too."
"The
people will attack one after another, taking them to be guilty, and,
fearing both sides, I repent of what I had no share in, my circumstances
being what they are."
"If you want information to save the Fatherland,
and also the Church and the ikons, I am the only one that can do it."
"But
only on condition that I get a pardon from the Secret Police by telegram
at once, me alone, but the rest may answer for it."
"Put a candle every
evening at seven o'clock in the porter's window for a signal."
"Seeing it,
I shall believe and come to kiss the merciful hand from Petersburg."
"But
on condition there's a pension for me, for else how am I to live?"
"You
won't regret it for it will mean a star for you."
"You must go secretly
or they'll wring your neck."
"Your excellency's desperate servant falls at
your feet."
"""Repentant free-thinker incognito."""
"Von Lembke explained that the letter had made its appearance in the
porter's room when it was left empty the day before."
"""So what do you think?"""
Pyotr Stepanovitch asked almost rudely.
"""I think it's an anonymous skit by way of a hoax."""
"""Most likely it is."
"There's no taking you in."""
"""What makes me think that is that it's so stupid."""
"""Have you received such documents here before?"""
"""Once or twice, anonymous letters."""
"""Oh, of course they wouldn't be signed."
In a different style?
"In
different handwritings?"""
"""Yes."""
"""And were they buffoonery like this one?"""
"""Yes, and you know... very disgusting."""
"""Well, if you had them before, it must be the same thing now."""
"""Especially because it's so stupid."
"Because these people are educated
and wouldn't write so stupidly."""
"""Of course, of course."""
"""But what if this is someone who really wants to turn informer?"""
"""It's not very likely,"" Pyotr Stepanovitch rapped out dryly."
"""What
does he mean by a telegram from the Secret Police and a pension?"
"It's
obviously a hoax."""
"""Yes, yes,"" Lembke admitted, abashed."
"""I tell you what: you leave this with me."
"I can certainly find out for
you before I track out the others."""
"""Take it,"" Lembke assented, though with some hesitation."
"""Have you shown it to anyone?"""
"""Is it likely!"
"No."""
"""Not to Yulia Mihailovna?"""
"""Oh, Heaven forbid!"
"And for God's sake don't you show it her!"""
"Lembke
cried in alarm."
"""She'll be so upset... and will be dreadfully angry with
me."""
"""Yes, you'll be the first to catch it; she'd say you brought it on
yourself if people write like that to you."
I know what women's logic is.
"Well, good-bye."
"I dare say I shall bring you the writer in a couple of
days or so."
"Above all, our compact!"""
"IV

Though Pyotr Stepanovitch was perhaps far from being a stupid man, Fedka
the convict had said of him truly ""that he would make up a man himself
and go on living with him too."""
"He came away from Lembke fully persuaded
that for the next six days, anyway, he had put his mind at rest, and
this interval was absolutely necessary for his own purposes."
"But it was
a false idea and founded entirely on the fact that he had made up for
himself once for all an Andrey Antonovitch who was a perfect simpleton."
"Like every morbidly suspicious man, Andrey Antonovitch was always
exceedingly and joyfully trustful the moment he got on to sure ground."
"The new turn of affairs struck him at first in a rather favourable light
in spite of some fresh and troublesome complications."
"Anyway, his former
doubts fell to the ground."
"Besides, he had been so tired for the last
few days, so exhausted and helpless, that his soul involuntarily yearned
for rest."
But alas!
he was again uneasy.
"The long time he had spent in
Petersburg had left ineradicable traces in his heart."
"The official and
even the secret history of the ""younger generation"" was fairly familiar
to him--he was a curious man and used to collect manifestoes--but he
could never understand a word of it."
"Now he felt like a man lost in
a forest."
"Every instinct told him that there was something in Pyotr
Stepanovitch's words utterly incongruous, anomalous, and grotesque,
""though there's no telling what may not happen with this 'younger
generation,' and the devil only knows what's going on among them,"" he
mused, lost in perplexity."
"And at this moment, to make matters worse, Blum poked his head in."
"He
had been waiting not far off through the whole of Pyotr Stepanovitch's
visit."
"This Blum was actually a distant relation of Andrey Antonovitch,
though the relationship had always been carefully and timorously
concealed."
"I must apologise to the reader for devoting a few words here
to this insignificant person."
"Blum was one of that strange class of
""unfortunate"" Germans who are unfortunate not through lack of ability
but through some inexplicable ill luck."
"""Unfortunate"" Germans are not
a myth, but really do exist even in Russia, and are of a special type."
"Andrey Antonovitch had always had a quite touching sympathy for him, and
wherever he could, as he rose himself in the service, had promoted him
to subordinate positions under him; but Blum had never been successful."
"Either the post was abolished after he had been appointed to it, or a
new chief took charge of the department; once he was almost arrested by
mistake with other people."
"He was precise, but he was gloomy to excess
and to his own detriment."
"He was tall and had red hair; he stooped and
was depressed and even sentimental; and in spite of his being humbled by
his life, he was obstinate and persistent as an ox, though always at
the wrong moment."
"For Andrey Antonovitch he, as well as his wife and
numerous family, had cherished for many years a reverent devotion."
Except Andrey Antonovitch no one had ever liked him.
"Yulia Mihailovna
would have discarded him from the first, but could not overcome her
husband's obstinacy."
It was the cause of their first conjugal quarrel.
"It had happened soon after their marriage, in the early days of their
honeymoon, when she was confronted with Blum, who, together with the
humiliating secret of his relationship, had been until then carefully
concealed from her."
"Andrey Antonovitch besought her with clasped hands,
told her pathetically all the story of Blum and their friendship from
childhood, but Yulia Mihailovna considered herself disgraced forever,
and even had recourse to fainting."
"Von Lembke would not budge an
inch, and declared that he would not give up Blum or part from him for
anything in the world, so that she was surprised at last and was obliged
to put up with Blum."
"It was settled, however, that the relationship
should be concealed even more carefully than before if possible, and
that even Blum's Christian name and patronymic should be changed,
because he too was for some reason called Andrey Antonovitch."
"Blum knew
no one in the town except the German chemist, had not called on anyone,
and led, as he always did, a lonely and niggardly existence."
"He had
long been aware of Andrey Antonovitch's literary peccadilloes."
"He was
generally summoned to listen to secret _tête-à-tête_ readings of his
novel; he would sit like a post for six hours at a stretch, perspiring
and straining his utmost to keep awake and smile."
"On reaching home he
would groan with his long-legged and lanky wife over their benefactor's
unhappy weakness for Russian literature."
Andrey Antonovitch looked with anguish at Blum.
"""I beg you to leave me alone, Blum,"" he began with agitated haste,
obviously anxious to avoid any renewal of the previous conversation
which had been interrupted by Pyotr Stepanovitch."
"""And yet this may be arranged in the most delicate way and with no
publicity; you have full power."""
"Blum respectfully but obstinately
insisted on some point, stooping forward and coming nearer and nearer by
small steps to Andrey Antonovitch."
"""Blum, you are so devoted to me and so anxious to serve me that I am
always in a panic when I look at you."""
"""You always say witty things, and sleep in peace satisfied with what
you've said, but that's how you damage yourself."""
"""Blum, I have just convinced myself that it's quite a mistake, quite a
mistake."""
"""Not from the words of that false, vicious young man whom you suspect
yourself?"
"He has won you by his flattering praise of your talent for
literature."""
"""Blum, you understand nothing about it; your project is absurd, I
tell you."
"We shall find nothing and there will be a fearful upset and
laughter too, and then Yulia Mihailovna...""

""We shall certainly find everything we are looking for."""
"Blum advanced
firmly towards him, laying his right hand on his heart."
"""We will make
a search suddenly early in the morning, carefully showing every
consideration for the person himself and strictly observing all the
prescribed forms of the law."
"The young men, Lyamshin and Telyatnikov,
assert positively that we shall find all we want."
"They were constant
visitors there."
Nobody is favourably disposed to Mr. Verhovensky.
"Madame
Stavrogin has openly refused him her graces, and every honest man, if
only there is such a one in this coarse town, is persuaded that a hotbed
of infidelity and social doctrines has always been concealed there."
"He
keeps all the forbidden books, Ryliev's 'Reflections,' all Herzen's
works...."
"I have an approximate catalogue, in case of need."""
"""Oh heavens!"
"Every one has these books; how simple you are, my poor
Blum."""
"""And many manifestoes,"" Blum went on without heeding the observation."
"""We shall end by certainly coming upon traces of the real manifestoes
here."
"That young Verhovensky I feel very suspicious of."""
"""But you are mixing up the father and the son."
"They are not on good
terms."
"The son openly laughs at his father."""
"""That's only a mask."""
"""Blum, you've sworn to torment me!"
Think!
"he is a conspicuous figure
here, after all."
"He's been a professor, he is a well-known man."
"He'll
make such an uproar and there will be such gibes all over the town, and
we shall make a mess of it all.... And only think how Yulia Mihailovna
will take it."""
Blum pressed forward and did not listen.
"""He was only a
lecturer, only a lecturer, and of a low rank when he retired."""
"He smote
himself on the chest."
"""He has no marks of distinction."
"He was discharged
from the service on suspicion of plots against the government."
"He has
been under secret supervision, and undoubtedly still is so."
"And in view
of the disorders that have come to light now, you are undoubtedly bound
in duty."
"You are losing your chance of distinction by letting slip the
real criminal."""
"""Yulia Mihailovna!"
"Get away, Blum,"" Von Lembke cried suddenly, hearing
the voice of his spouse in the next room."
"Blum started but did not give
in."
"""Allow me, allow me,"" he persisted, pressing both hands still more
tightly on his chest."
"""Get away!"""
hissed Andrey Antonovitch.
"""Do what you like... afterwards."
"Oh, my God!"""
The curtain was raised and Yulia Mihailovna made her appearance.
"She
stood still majestically at the sight of Blum, casting a haughty and
offended glance at him, as though the very presence of this man was an
affront to her."
"Blum respectfully made her a deep bow without speaking
and, doubled up with veneration, moved towards the door on tiptoe with
his arms held a little away from him."
"Either because he really took Andrey Antonovitch's last hysterical
outbreak as a direct permission to act as he was asking, or whether
he strained a point in this case for the direct advantage of his
benefactor, because he was too confident that success would crown his
efforts; anyway, as we shall see later on, this conversation of the
governor with his subordinate led to a very surprising event which
amused many people, became public property, moved Yulia Mihailovna to
fierce anger, utterly disconcerting Andrey Antonovitch and reducing him
at the crucial moment to a state of deplorable indecision."
"V

It was a busy day for Pyotr Stepanovitch."
"From Von Lembke he hastened to
Bogoyavlensky Street, but as he went along Bykovy Street, past the house
where Karmazinov was staying, he suddenly stopped, grinned, and
went into the house."
"The servant told him that he was expected, which
interested him, as he had said nothing beforehand of his coming."
"But the great writer really had been expecting him, not only that day
but the day before and the day before that."
"Three days before he had
handed him his manuscript _Merci_ (which he had meant to read at the
literary matinée at Yulia Mihailovna's fête)."
"He had done this out of
amiability, fully convinced that he was agreeably flattering the young
man's vanity by letting him read the great work beforehand."
"Pyotr
Stepanovitch had noticed long before that this vainglorious, spoiled
gentleman, who was so offensively unapproachable for all but the elect,
this writer ""with the intellect of a statesman,"" was simply trying
to curry favour with him, even with avidity."
"I believe the young man
guessed at last that Karmazinov considered him, if not the leader of
the whole secret revolutionary movement in Russia, at least one of those
most deeply initiated into the secrets of the Russian revolution who had
an incontestable influence on the younger generation."
"The state of mind
of ""the cleverest man in Russia"" interested Pyotr Stepanovitch, but
hitherto he had, for certain reasons, avoided explaining himself."
"The great writer was staying in the house belonging to his sister, who
was the wife of a _kammerherr_ and had an estate in the neighbourhood."
"Both she and her husband had the deepest reverence for their illustrious
relation, but to their profound regret both of them happened to be in
Moscow at the time of his visit, so that the honour of receiving him
fell to the lot of an old lady, a poor relation of the _kammerherr's,_ who
had for years lived in the family and looked after the housekeeping."
"All
the household had moved about on tiptoe since Karmazinov's arrival."
"The
old lady sent news to Moscow almost every day, how he had slept, what he
had deigned to eat, and had once sent a telegram to announce that after
a dinner-party at the mayor's he was obliged to take a spoonful of a
well-known medicine."
"She rarely plucked up courage to enter his room,
though he behaved courteously to her, but dryly, and only talked to her
of what was necessary."
"When Pyotr Stepanovitch came in, he was eating his morning cutlet with
half a glass of red wine."
"Pyotr Stepanovitch had been to see him before
and always found him eating this cutlet, which he finished in his
presence without ever offering him anything."
"After the cutlet a little
cup of coffee was served."
"The footman who brought in the dishes wore a
swallow-tail coat, noiseless boots, and gloves."
"""Ha ha!"""
"Karmazinov got up from the sofa, wiping his mouth with a
table-napkin, and came forward to kiss him with an air of unmixed
delight--after the characteristic fashion of Russians if they are very
illustrious."
"But Pyotr Stepanovitch knew by experience that, though
Karmazinov made a show of kissing him, he really only proffered his
cheek, and so this time he did the same: the cheeks met."
"Karmazinov did
not show that he noticed it, sat down on the sofa, and affably offered
Pyotr Stepanovitch an easy chair facing him, in which the latter
stretched himself at once."
"""You don't... wouldn't like some lunch?"""
"inquired Karmazinov, abandoning
his usual habit but with an air, of course, which would prompt a polite
refusal."
Pyotr Stepanovitch at once expressed a desire for lunch.
"A
shade of offended surprise darkened the face of his host, but only for
an instant; he nervously rang for the servant and, in spite of all his
breeding, raised his voice scornfully as he gave orders for a second
lunch to be served."
"""What will you have, cutlet or coffee?"""
he asked once more.
"""A cutlet and coffee, and tell him to bring some more wine, I am
hungry,"" answered Pyotr Stepanovitch, calmly scrutinising his host's
attire."
"Mr. Karmazinov was wearing a sort of indoor wadded jacket with
pearl buttons, but it was too short, which was far from becoming to his
rather comfortable stomach and the solid curves of his hips."
"But tastes
differ."
"Over his knees he had a checkered woollen plaid reaching to the
floor, though it was warm in the room."
"""Are you unwell?"""
commented Pyotr Stepanovitch.
"""No, not unwell, but I am afraid of being so in this climate,"" answered
the writer in his squeaky voice, though he uttered each word with a soft
cadence and agreeable gentlemanly lisp."
"""I've been expecting you since
yesterday."""
"""Why?"
"I didn't say I'd come."""
"""No, but you have my manuscript."
"Have you... read it?"""
"""Manuscript?"
"Which one?"""
Karmazinov was terribly surprised.
"""But you've brought it with you, haven't you?"""
"He was so disturbed that
he even left off eating and looked at Pyotr Stepanovitch with a face of
dismay."
"""Ah, that _Bonjour_ you mean....""

_""Merci."
"""_

""Oh, all right."
"I'd quite forgotten it and hadn't read it; I haven't had
time."
"I really don't know, it's not in my pockets... it must be on my
table."
"Don't be uneasy, it will be found."""
"""No, I'd better send to your rooms at once."
"It might be lost; besides,
it might be stolen."""
"""Oh, who'd want it!"
But why are you so alarmed?
"Why, Yulia Mihailovna
told me you always have several copies made--one kept at a notary's
abroad, another in Petersburg, a third in Moscow, and then you send some
to a bank, I believe."""
"""But Moscow might be burnt again and my manuscript with it."
"No, I'd
better send at once."""
"""Stay, here it is!"""
"Pyotr Stepanovitch pulled a roll of note-paper
out of a pocket at the back of his coat."
"""It's a little crumpled."
"Only
fancy, it's been lying there with my pocket-handkerchief ever since I
took it from you; I forgot it."""
"Karmazinov greedily snatched the manuscript, carefully examined it,
counted the pages, and laid it respectfully beside him on a special
table, for the time, in such a way that he would not lose sight of it
for an instant."
"""You don't read very much, it seems?"""
"he hissed, unable to restrain
himself."
"""No, not very much."""
"""And nothing in the way of Russian literature?"""
"""In the way of Russian literature?"
"Let me see, I have read
something.... 'On the Way' or 'Away!'"
"or 'At the Parting of the Ways'--
something of the sort; I don't remember."
"It's a long time since I read
it, five years ago."
"I've no time."""
A silence followed.
"""When I came I assured every one that you were a very intelligent man,
and now I believe every one here is wild over you."""
"""Thank you,"" Pyotr Stepanovitch answered calmly."
Lunch was brought in.
"Pyotr Stepanovitch pounced on the cutlet with
extraordinary appetite, had eaten it in a trice, tossed off the wine and
swallowed his coffee."
"""This boor,"" thought Karmazinov, looking at him askance as he munched
the last morsel and drained the last drops--""this boor probably
understood the biting taunt in my words... and no doubt he has read
the manuscript with eagerness; he is simply lying with some object."
"But
possibly he is not lying and is only genuinely stupid."
"I like a genius
to be rather stupid."
Mayn't he be a sort of genius among them?
"Devil
take the fellow!"""
"He got up from the sofa and began pacing from one end of the room to the
other for the sake of exercise, as he always did after lunch."
"""Leaving here soon?"""
"asked Pyotr Stepanovitch from his easy chair,
lighting a cigarette."
"""I really came to sell an estate and I am in the hands of my bailiff."""
"""You left, I believe, because they expected an epidemic out there after
the war?"""
"""N-no, not entirely for that reason,"" Mr. Karmazinov went on, uttering
his phrases with an affable intonation, and each time he turned round in
pacing the corner there was a faint but jaunty quiver of his right leg."
"""I certainly intend to live as long as I can."""
"He laughed, not without
venom."
"""There is something in our Russian nobility that makes them wear
out very quickly, from every point of view."
"But I wish to wear out as
late as possible, and now I am going abroad for good; there the climate
is better, the houses are of stone, and everything stronger."
"Europe will
last my time, I think."
"What do you think?"""
"""How can I tell?"""
"""H'm."
"If the Babylon out there really does fall, and great will be the
fall thereof (about which I quite agree with you, yet I think it will
last my time), there's nothing to fall here in Russia, comparatively
speaking."
"There won't be stones to fall, everything will crumble into
dirt."
"Holy Russia has less power of resistance than anything in the
world."
"The Russian peasantry is still held together somehow by the
Russian God; but according to the latest accounts the Russian God is not
to be relied upon, and scarcely survived the emancipation; it certainly
gave Him a severe shock."
"And now, what with railways, what with you..."
"I've no faith in the Russian God."""
"""And how about the European one?"""
"""I don't believe in any."
I've been slandered to the youth of Russia.
I've always sympathised with every movement among them.
"I was shown the
manifestoes here."
"Every one looks at them with perplexity because they
are frightened at the way things are put in them, but every one is
convinced of their power even if they don't admit it to themselves."
"Everybody has been rolling downhill, and every one has known for ages
that they have nothing to clutch at."
"I am persuaded of the success of
this mysterious propaganda, if only because Russia is now pre-eminently
the place in all the world where anything you like may happen without
any opposition."
"I understand only too well why wealthy Russians all
flock abroad, and more and more so every year."
It's simply instinct.
"If
the ship is sinking, the rats are the first to leave it."
"Holy Russia is
a country of wood, of poverty... and of danger, the country of ambitious
beggars in its upper classes, while the immense majority live in poky
little huts."
"She will be glad of any way of escape; you have only to
present it to her."
"It's only the government that still means to
resist, but it brandishes its cudgel in the dark and hits its own men."
Everything here is doomed and awaiting the end.
"Russia as she is has no
future."
"I have become a German and I am proud of it."""
"""But you began about the manifestoes."
"Tell me everything; how do you
look at them?"""
"""Every one is afraid of them, so they must be influential."
"They openly
unmask what is false and prove that there is nothing to lay hold of
among us, and nothing to lean upon."
"They speak aloud while all is
silent."
"What is most effective about them (in spite of their style) is
the incredible boldness with which they look the truth straight in the
face."
"To look facts straight in the face is only possible to Russians of
this generation."
"No, in Europe they are not yet so bold; it is a realm
of stone, there there is still something to lean upon."
"So far as I see
and am able to judge, the whole essence of the Russian revolutionary
idea lies in the negation of honour."
"I like its being so boldly and
fearlessly expressed."
"No, in Europe they wouldn't understand it yet, but
that's just what we shall clutch at."
"For a Russian a sense of honour is
only a superfluous burden, and it always has been a burden through all
his history."
"The open 'right to dishonour' will attract him more than
anything."
"I belong to the older generation and, I must confess, still
cling to honour, but only from habit."
"It is only that I prefer the old
forms, granted it's from timidity; you see one must live somehow what's
left of one's life."""
He suddenly stopped.
"""I am talking,"" he thought, ""while he holds his tongue and watches me."
He has come to make me ask him a direct question.
"And I shall ask him."""
"""Yulia Mihailovna asked me by some stratagem to find out from you what
the surprise is that you are preparing for the ball to-morrow,"" Pyotr
Stepanovitch asked suddenly."
"""Yes, there really will be a surprise and I certainly shall
astonish..."" said Karmazinov with increased dignity."
"""But I won't tell
you what the secret is."""
Pyotr Stepanovitch did not insist.
"""There is a young man here called Shatov,"" observed the great writer."
"""Would you believe it, I haven't seen him."""
"""A very nice person."
"What about him?"""
"""Oh, nothing."
He talks about something.
"Isn't he the person who gave
Stavrogin that slap in the face?"""
"""Yes."""
"""And what's your opinion of Stavrogin?"""
"""I don't know; he is such a flirt."""
"Karmazinov detested Stavrogin because it was the latter's habit not to
take any notice of him."
"""That flirt,"" he said, chuckling, ""if what is advocated in your
manifestoes ever comes to pass, will be the first to be hanged."""
"""Perhaps before,"" Pyotr Stepanovitch said suddenly."
"""Quite right too,"" Karmazinov assented, not laughing, and with
pronounced gravity."
"""You have said so once before, and, do you know, I repeated it to him."""
"""What, you surely didn't repeat it?"""
Karmazinov laughed again.
"""He said that if he were to be hanged it would be enough for you to
be flogged, not simply as a complement but to hurt, as they flog the
peasants."""
Pyotr Stepanovitch took his hat and got up from his seat.
"Karmazinov
held out both hands to him at parting."
"""And what if all that you are... plotting for is destined to come
to pass..."" he piped suddenly, in a honeyed voice with a peculiar
intonation, still holding his hands in his."
"""How soon could it come
about?"""
"""How could I tell?"""
Pyotr Stepanovitch answered rather roughly.
"They
looked intently into each other's eyes."
"""At a guess?"
"Approximately?"""
Karmazinov piped still more sweetly.
"""You'll have time to sell your estate and time to clear out too,"" Pyotr
Stepanovitch muttered still more roughly."
"They looked at one another
even more intently."
There was a minute of silence.
"""It will begin early next May and will be over by October,"" Pyotr
Stepanovitch said suddenly."
"""I thank you sincerely,"" Karmazinov pronounced in a voice saturated with
feeling, pressing his hands."
"""You will have time to get out of the ship, you rat,"" Pyotr Stepanovitch
was thinking as he went out into the street."
"""Well, if that 'imperial
intellect' inquires so confidently of the day and the hour and thanks
me so respectfully for the information I have given, we mustn't doubt
of ourselves."
[He grinned.]
H'm!
"But he really isn't stupid... and he is
simply a rat escaping; men like that don't tell tales!"""
He ran to Filipov's house in Bogoyavlensky Street.
"VI

Pyotr Stepanovitch went first to Kirillov's."
"He found him, as usual,
alone, and at the moment practising gymnastics, that is, standing with
his legs apart, brandishing his arms above his head in a peculiar way."
On the floor lay a ball.
"The tea stood cold on the table, not cleared
since breakfast."
Pyotr Stepanovitch stood for a minute on the threshold.
"""You are very anxious about your health, it seems,"" he said in a loud
and cheerful tone, going into the room."
"""What a jolly ball, though; foo,
how it bounces!"
"Is that for gymnastics too?"""
Kirillov put on his coat.
"""Yes, that's for the good of my health too,"" he muttered dryly."
"""Sit
down."""
"""I'm only here for a minute."
"Still, I'll sit down."
"Health is all very
well, but I've come to remind you of our agreement."
"The appointed time
is approaching... in a certain sense,"" he concluded awkwardly."
"""What agreement?"""
"""How can you ask?"""
Pyotr Stepanovitch was startled and even dismayed.
"""It's not an agreement and not an obligation."
"I have not bound myself in
any way; it's a mistake on your part."""
"""I say, what's this you're doing?"""
Pyotr Stepanovitch jumped up.
"""What I choose."""
"""What do you choose?"""
"""The same as before."""
"""How am I to understand that?"
"Does that mean that you are in the same
mind?"""
"""Yes."
"Only there's no agreement and never has been, and I have not bound
myself in any way."
"I could do as I like and I can still do as I like."""
Kirillov explained himself curtly and contemptuously.
"""I agree, I agree; be as free as you like if you don't change your
mind."""
Pyotr Stepanovitch sat down again with a satisfied air.
"""You are
angry over a word."
"You've become very irritable of late; that's why
I've avoided coming to see you."
"I was quite sure, though, you would be
loyal."""
"""I dislike you very much, but you can be perfectly sure--though I don't
regard it as loyalty and disloyalty."""
"""But do you know"" (Pyotr Stepanovitch was startled again) ""we must talk
things over thoroughly again so as not to get in a muddle."
"The business
needs accuracy, and you keep giving me such shocks."
"Will you let me
speak?"""
"""Speak,"" snapped Kirillov, looking away."
"""You made up your mind long ago to take your life..."
"I mean, you had the
idea in your mind."
Is that the right expression?
"Is there any mistake
about that?"""
"""I have the same idea still."""
"""Excellent."
"Take note that no one has forced it on you."""
"""Rather not; what nonsense you talk."""
"""I dare say I express it very stupidly."
"Of course, it would be very
stupid to force anybody to it."
I'll go on.
"You were a member of the
society before its organisation was changed, and confessed it to one of
the members."""
"""I didn't confess it, I simply said so."""
"""Quite so."
And it would be absurd to confess such a thing.
"What a
confession!"
You simply said so.
"Excellent."""
"""No, it's not excellent, for you are being tedious."
"I am not obliged to
give you any account of myself and you can't understand my ideas."
"I want
to put an end to my life, because that's my idea, because I don't want
to be afraid of death, because... because there's no need for you to
know."
What do you want?
Would you like tea?
It's cold.
"Let me get you
another glass."""
"Pyotr Stepanovitch actually had taken up the teapot and was looking for
an empty glass."
Kirillov went to the cupboard and brought a clean glass.
"""I've just had lunch at Karmazinov's,"" observed his visitor, ""then
I listened to him talking, and perspired and got into a sweat again
running here."
"I am fearfully thirsty."""
"""Drink."
"Cold tea is good."""
"Kirillov sat down on his chair again and again fixed his eyes on the
farthest corner."
"""The idea had arisen in the society,"" he went on in the same voice,
""that I might be of use if I killed myself, and that when you get up
some bit of mischief here, and they are looking for the guilty, I might
suddenly shoot myself and leave a letter saying I did it all, so that
you might escape suspicion for another year."""
"""For a few days, anyway; one day is precious."""
"""Good."
"So for that reason they asked me, if I would, to wait."
"I said I'd
wait till the society fixed the day, because it makes no difference to
me."""
"""Yes, but remember that you bound yourself not to make up your last
letter without me and that in Russia you would be at my... well, at
my disposition, that is for that purpose only."
"I need hardly say, in
everything else, of course, you are free,"" Pyotr Stepanovitch added
almost amiably."
"""I didn't bind myself, I agreed, because it makes no difference to me."""
"""Good, good."
"I have no intention of wounding your vanity, but...""

""It's not a question of vanity."""
"""But remember that a hundred and twenty thalers were collected for your
journey, so you've taken money."""
"""Not at all."""
Kirillov fired up.
"""The money was not on that condition."
"One doesn't take money for that."""
"""People sometimes do."""
"""That's a lie."
"I sent a letter from Petersburg, and in Petersburg I paid
you a hundred and twenty thalers; I put it in your hand... and it has
been sent off there, unless you've kept it for yourself."""
"""All right, all right, I don't dispute anything; it has been sent off."
"All that matters is that you are still in the same mind."""
"""Exactly the same."
"When you come and tell me it's time, I'll carry it
all out."
"Will it be very soon?"""
"""Not very many days...."
"But remember, we'll make up the letter together,
the same night."""
"""The same day if you like."
"You say I must take the responsibility for
the manifestoes on myself?"""
"""And something else too."""
"""I am not going to make myself out responsible for everything."""
"""What won't you be responsible for?"""
said Pyotr Stepanovitch again.
"""What I don't choose; that's enough."
"I don't want to talk about it any
more."""
Pyotr Stepanovitch controlled himself and changed the subject.
"""To speak of something else,"" he began, ""will you be with us this
evening?"
"It's Virginsky's name-day; that's the pretext for our meeting."""
"""I don't want to."""
"""Do me a favour."
Do come.
You must.
"We must impress them by our number
and our looks."
"You have a face... well, in one word, you have a fateful
face."""
"""You think so?"""
laughed Kirillov.
"""Very well, I'll come, but not for the
sake of my face."
"What time is it?"""
"""Oh, quite early, half-past six."
"And, you know, you can go in, sit down,
and not speak to any one, however many there may be there."
"Only, I say,
don't forget to bring pencil and paper with you."""
"""What's that for?"""
"""Why, it makes no difference to you, and it's my special request."
"You'll
only have to sit still, speaking to no one, listen, and sometimes seem
to make a note."
"You can draw something, if you like."""
"""What nonsense!"
"What for?"""
"""Why, since it makes no difference to you!"
"You keep saying that it's
just the same to you."""
"""No, what for?"""
"""Why, because that member of the society, the inspector, has stopped at
Moscow and I told some of them here that possibly the inspector may turn
up to-night; and they'll think that you are the inspector."
"And as you've
been here three weeks already, they'll be still more surprised."""
"""Stage tricks."
"You haven't got an inspector in Moscow."""
"""Well, suppose I haven't--damn him!--what business is that of yours
and what bother will it be to you?"
"You are a member of the society
yourself."""
"""Tell them I am the inspector; I'll sit still and hold my tongue, but I
won't have the pencil and paper."""
"""But why?"""
"""I don't want to."""
"Pyotr Stepanovitch was really angry; he turned positively green, but
again he controlled himself."
He got up and took his hat.
"""Is that fellow with you?"""
"he brought out suddenly, in a low voice."
"""Yes."""
"""That's good."
I'll soon get him away.
"Don't be uneasy."""
"""I am not uneasy."
He is only here at night.
"The old woman is in the
hospital, her daughter-in-law is dead."
"I've been alone for the last two
days."
"I've shown him the place in the paling where you can take a board
out; he gets through, no one sees."""
"""I'll take him away soon."""
"""He says he has got plenty of places to stay the night in."""
"""That's rot; they are looking for him, but here he wouldn't be noticed."
"Do you ever get into talk with him?"""
"""Yes, at night."
He abuses you tremendously.
"I've been reading the
'Apocalypse' to him at night, and we have tea."
"He listened eagerly, very
eagerly, the whole night."""
"""Hang it all, you'll convert him to Christianity!"""
"""He is a Christian as it is."
"Don't be uneasy, he'll do the murder."
"Whom
do you want to murder?"""
"""No, I don't want him for that, I want him for something different....
And does Shatov know about Fedka?"""
"""I don't talk to Shatov, and I don't see him."""
"""Is he angry?"""
"""No, we are not angry, only we shun one another."
"We lay too long side by
side in America."""
"""I am going to him directly."""
"""As you like."""
"""Stavrogin and I may come and see you from there, about ten o'clock."""
"""Do."""
"""I want to talk to him about something important...."
"I say, make me
a present of your ball; what do you want with it now?"
"I want it for
gymnastics too."
"I'll pay you for it if you like."""
"""You can take it without."""
Pyotr Stepanovitch put the ball in the back pocket of his coat.
"""But I'll give you nothing against Stavrogin,"" Kirillov muttered after
his guest, as he saw him out."
"The latter looked at him in amazement but
did not answer."
"Kirillov's last words perplexed Pyotr Stepanovitch extremely; he had not
time yet to discover their meaning, but even while he was on the stairs
of Shatov's lodging he tried to remove all trace of annoyance and to
assume an amiable expression."
Shatov was at home and rather unwell.
"He
was lying on his bed, though dressed."
"""What bad luck!"""
Pyotr Stepanovitch cried out in the doorway.
"""Are you
really ill?"""
"The amiable expression of his face suddenly vanished; there was a gleam
of spite in his eyes."
"""Not at all."""
Shatov jumped up nervously.
"""I am not ill at all... a
little headache...""

He was disconcerted; the sudden appearance of such a visitor positively
alarmed him."
"""You mustn't be ill for the job I've come about,"" Pyotr Stepanovitch
began quickly and, as it were, peremptorily."
"""Allow me to sit down."""
"(He
sat down.)"
"""And you sit down again on your bedstead; that's right."
"There
will be a party of our fellows at Virginsky's to-night on the pretext of
his birthday; it will have no political character, however--we've seen
to that."
I am coming with Nikolay Stavrogin.
"I would not, of course,
have dragged you there, knowing your way of thinking at present...
simply to save your being worried, not because we think you would betray
us."
"But as things have turned out, you will have to go."
"You'll meet
there the very people with whom we shall finally settle how you are
to leave the society and to whom you are to hand over what is in your
keeping."
"We'll do it without being noticed; I'll take you aside into a
corner; there'll be a lot of people and there's no need for every one to
know."
"I must confess I've had to keep my tongue wagging on your behalf;
but now I believe they've agreed, on condition you hand over the
printing press and all the papers, of course."
"Then you can go where you
please."""
"Shatov listened, frowning and resentful."
"The nervous alarm of a moment
before had entirely left him."
"""I don't acknowledge any sort of obligation to give an account to the
devil knows whom,"" he declared definitely."
"""No one has the authority to
set me free."""
"""Not quite so."
A great deal has been entrusted to you.
"You hadn't the
right to break off simply."
"Besides, you made no clear statement about
it, so that you put them in an ambiguous position."""
"""I stated my position clearly by letter as soon as I arrived here."""
"""No, it wasn't clear,"" Pyotr Stepanovitch retorted calmly."
"""I sent you
'A Noble Personality' to be printed here, and meaning the copies to be
kept here till they were wanted; and the two manifestoes as well."
"You
returned them with an ambiguous letter which explained nothing."""
"""I refused definitely to print them."""
"""Well, not definitely."
"You wrote that you couldn't, but you didn't
explain for what reason."
'I can't' doesn't mean 'I don't want to.'
"It
might be supposed that you were simply unable through circumstances."
"That was how they took it, and considered that you still meant to keep
up your connection with the society, so that they might have entrusted
something to you again and so have compromised themselves."
"They say here
that you simply meant to deceive them, so that you might betray them
when you got hold of something important."
"I have defended you to the
best of my powers, and have shown your brief note as evidence in your
favour."
"But I had to admit on rereading those two lines that they were
misleading and not conclusive."""
"""You kept that note so carefully then?"""
"""My keeping it means nothing; I've got it still."""
"""Well, I don't care, damn it!"""
Shatov cried furiously.
"""Your fools may
consider that I've betrayed them if they like--what is it to me?"
"I
should like to see what you can do to me?"""
"""Your name would be noted, and at the first success of the revolution
you would be hanged."""
"""That's when you get the upper hand and dominate Russia?"""
"""You needn't laugh."
"I tell you again, I stood up for you."
"Anyway, I
advise you to turn up to-day."
Why waste words through false pride?
Isn't it better to part friends?
"In any case you'll have to give up the
printing press and the old type and papers--that's what we must talk
about."""
"""I'll come,"" Shatov muttered, looking down thoughtfully."
Pyotr Stepanovitch glanced askance at him from his place.
"""Will Stavrogin be there?"""
"Shatov asked suddenly, raising his head."
"""He is certain to be."""
"""Ha ha!"""
Again they were silent for a minute.
"Shatov grinned disdainfully and
irritably."
"""And that contemptible 'Noble Personality' of yours, that I wouldn't
print here."
"Has it been printed?"""
he asked.
"""Yes."""
"""To make the schoolboys believe that Herzen himself had written it in
your album?"""
"""Yes, Herzen himself."""
Again they were silent for three minutes.
"At last Shatov got up from the
bed."
"""Go out of my room; I don't care to sit with you."""
"""I'm going,"" Pyotr Stepanovitch brought out with positive alacrity,
getting up at once."
"""Only one word: Kirillov is quite alone in the lodge
now, isn't he, without a servant?"""
"""Quite alone."
"Get along; I can't stand being in the same room with you."""
"""Well, you are a pleasant customer now!"""
"Pyotr Stepanovitch reflected
gaily as he went out into the street, ""and you will be pleasant this
evening too, and that just suits me; nothing better could be wished,
nothing better could be wished!"
"The Russian God Himself seems helping
me."""
"VII

He had probably been very busy that day on all sorts of errands and
probably with success, which was reflected in the self-satisfied
expression of his face when at six o'clock that evening he turned up at
Stavrogin's."
"But he was not at once admitted: Stavrogin had just locked
himself in the study with Mavriky Nikolaevitch."
"This news instantly made
Pyotr Stepanovitch anxious."
"He seated himself close to the study door
to wait for the visitor to go away."
"He could hear conversation but could
not catch the words."
"The visit did not last long; soon he heard a noise,
the sound of an extremely loud and abrupt voice, then the door opened
and Mavriky Nikolaevitch came out with a very pale face."
"He did not
notice Pyotr Stepanovitch, and quickly passed by."
"Pyotr Stepanovitch
instantly ran into the study."
"I cannot omit a detailed account of the very brief interview that had
taken place between the two ""rivals""--an interview which might well
have seemed impossible under the circumstances, but which had yet taken
place."
This is how it had come about.
"Nikolay Vsyevolodovitch had been enjoying
an after-dinner nap on the couch in his study when Alexey Yegorytch had
announced the unexpected visitor."
"Hearing the name, he had positively
leapt up, unwilling to believe it."
"But soon a smile gleamed on his
lips--a smile of haughty triumph and at the same time of a blank,
incredulous wonder."
"The visitor, Mavriky Nikolaevitch, seemed struck by
the expression of that smile as he came in; anyway, he stood still in
the middle of the room as though uncertain whether to come further in or
to turn back."
"Stavrogin succeeded at once in transforming the expression
of his face, and with an air of grave surprise took a step towards him."
"The visitor did not take his outstretched hand, but awkwardly moved a
chair and, not uttering a word, sat down without waiting for his host to
do so."
"Nikolay Vsyevolodovitch sat down on the sofa facing him obliquely
and, looking at Mavriky Nikolaevitch, waited in silence."
"""If you can, marry Lizaveta Nikolaevna,"" Mavriky Nikolaevitch brought
out suddenly at last, and what was most curious, it was impossible
to tell from his tone whether it was an entreaty, a recommendation, a
surrender, or a command."
"Stavrogin still remained silent, but the visitor had evidently said all
he had come to say and gazed at him persistently, waiting for an answer."
"""If I am not mistaken (but it's quite certain), Lizaveta Nikolaevna is
already betrothed to you,"" Stavrogin said at last."
"""Promised and betrothed,"" Mavriky Nikolaevitch assented firmly and
clearly."
"""You have... quarrelled?"
"Excuse me, Mavriky Nikolaevitch."""
"""No, she 'loves and respects me'; those are her words."
"Her words are
more precious than anything."""
"""Of that there can be no doubt."""
"""But let me tell you, if she were standing in the church at her wedding
and you were to call her, she'd give up me and every one and go to you."""
"""From the wedding?"""
"""Yes, and after the wedding."""
"""Aren't you making a mistake?"""
"""No."
"Under her persistent, sincere, and intense hatred for you love is
flashing out at every moment... and madness... the sincerest infinite
love and... madness!"
"On the contrary, behind the love she feels for me,
which is sincere too, every moment there are flashes of hatred... the
most intense hatred!"
I could never have fancied all these transitions...
"before."""
"""But I wonder, though, how could you come here and dispose of the hand
of Lizaveta Nikolaevna?"
Have you the right to do so?
"Has she authorised
you?"""
Mavriky Nikolaevitch frowned and for a minute he looked down.
"""That's all words on your part,"" he brought out suddenly, ""words of
revenge and triumph; I am sure you can read between the lines, and is
this the time for petty vanity?"
Haven't you satisfaction enough?
"Must I
really dot my i's and go into it all?"
"Very well, I will dot my i's, if
you are so anxious for my humiliation."
"I have no right, it's impossible
for me to be authorised; Lizaveta Nikolaevna knows nothing about it
and her betrothed has finally lost his senses and is only fit for a
madhouse, and, to crown everything, has come to tell you so himself."
"You
are the only man in the world who can make her happy, and I am the one
to make her unhappy."
"You are trying to get her, you are pursuing her,
but--I don't know why--you won't marry her."
"If it's because of a lovers'
quarrel abroad and I must be sacrificed to end it, sacrifice me."
"She is
too unhappy and I can't endure it."
"My words are not a sanction, not a
prescription, and so it's no slur on your pride."
"If you care to take
my place at the altar, you can do it without any sanction from me, and
there is no ground for me to come to you with a mad proposal, especially
as our marriage is utterly impossible after the step I am taking now."
"I
cannot lead her to the altar feeling myself an abject wretch."
"What I am
doing here and my handing her over to you, perhaps her bitterest foe, is
to my mind something so abject that I shall never get over it."""
"""Will you shoot yourself on our wedding day?"""
"""No, much later."
Why stain her bridal dress with my blood?
"Perhaps I
shall not shoot myself at all, either now or later."""
"""I suppose you want to comfort me by saying that?"""
"""You?"
"What would the blood of one more mean to you?"""
"He turned pale and
his eyes gleamed."
A minute of silence followed.
"""Excuse me for the questions I've asked you,"" Stavrogin began again;
""some of them I had no business to ask you, but one of them I think I
have every right to put to you."
"Tell me, what facts have led you to
form a conclusion as to my feelings for Lizaveta Nikolaevna?"
"I mean to
a conviction of a degree of feeling on my part as would justify your
coming here... and risking such a proposal."""
"""What?"""
Mavriky Nikolaevitch positively started.
"""Haven't you been
trying to win her?"
"Aren't you trying to win her, and don't you want to
win her?"""
"""Generally speaking, I can't speak of my feeling for this woman or that
to a third person or to anyone except the woman herself."
"You must excuse
it, it's a constitutional peculiarity."
"But to make up for it, I'll tell
you the truth about everything else; I am married, and it's impossible
for me either to marry or to try 'to win' anyone."""
"Mavriky Nikolaevitch was so astounded that he started back in his chair
and for some time stared fixedly into Stavrogin's face."
"""Only fancy, I never thought of that,"" he muttered."
"""You said then, that
morning, that you were not married... and so I believed you were not
married."""
"He turned terribly pale; suddenly he brought his fist down on the table
with all his might."
"""If after that confession you don't leave Lizaveta Nikolaevna alone,
if you make her unhappy, I'll kill you with my stick like a dog in a
ditch!"""
He jumped up and walked quickly out of the room.
"Pyotr Stepanovitch,
running in, found his host in a most unexpected frame of mind."
"""Ah, that's you!"""
"Stavrogin laughed loudly; his laughter seemed to be
provoked simply by the appearance of Pyotr Stepanovitch as he ran in
with such impulsive curiosity."
"""Were you listening at the door?"
Wait a bit.
What have you come about?
"I promised you something, didn't I?"
"Ah, bah!"
"I remember, to meet 'our
fellows.'"
Let us go.
I am delighted.
"You couldn't have thought of
anything more appropriate."""
"He snatched up his hat and they both went at
once out of the house."
"""Are you laughing beforehand at the prospect of seeing 'our fellows'?"""
"chirped gaily Pyotr Stepanovitch, dodging round him with obsequious
alacrity, at one moment trying to walk beside his companion on the
narrow brick pavement and at the next running right into the mud of
the road; for Stavrogin walked in the middle of the pavement without
observing that he left no room for anyone else."
"""I am not laughing at all,"" he answered loudly and gaily; ""on the
contrary, I am sure that you have the most serious set of people there."""
"""'Surly dullards,' as you once deigned to express it."""
"""Nothing is more amusing sometimes than a surly dullard."""
"""Ah, you mean Mavriky Nikolaevitch?"
"I am convinced he came to give up
his betrothed to you, eh?"
"I egged him on to do it, indirectly, would you
believe it?"
"And if he doesn't give her up, we'll take her, anyway, won't
we--eh?"""
"Pyotr Stepanovitch knew no doubt that he was running some risk in
venturing on such sallies, but when he was excited he preferred to risk
anything rather than to remain in uncertainty."
Stavrogin only laughed.
"""You still reckon you'll help me?"""
he asked.
"""If you call me."
"But you know there's one way, and the best one."""
"""Do I know your way?"""
"""Oh no, that's a secret for the time."
"Only remember, a secret has its
price."""
"""I know what it costs,"" Stavrogin muttered to himself, but he restrained
himself and was silent."
"""What it costs?"
"What did you say?"""
Pyotr Stepanovitch was startled.
"""I said, 'Damn you and your secret!'"
"You'd better be telling me who will
be there."
"I know that we are going to a name-day party, but who will be
there?"""
"""Oh, all sorts!"
"Even Kirillov."""
"""All members of circles?"""
"""Hang it all, you are in a hurry!"
"There's not one circle formed yet."""
"""How did you manage to distribute so many manifestoes then?"""
"""Where we are going only four are members of the circle."
"The others on
probation are spying on one another with jealous eagerness, and bring
reports to me."
They are a trustworthy set.
"It's all material which
we must organise, and then we must clear out."
"But you wrote the rules
yourself, there's no need to explain."""
"""Are things going badly then?"
"Is there a hitch?"""
"""Going?"
Couldn't be better.
"It will amuse you: the first thing which has
a tremendous effect is giving them titles."
"Nothing has more influence
than a title."
"I invent ranks and duties on purpose; I have secretaries,
secret spies, treasurers, presidents, registrars, their assistants--they
like it awfully, it's taken capitally."
"Then, the next force is
sentimentalism, of course."
"You know, amongst us socialism spreads
principally through sentimentalism."
"But the trouble is these lieutenants
who bite; sometimes you put your foot in it."
"Then come the out-and-out
rogues; well, they are a good sort, if you like, and sometimes very
useful; but they waste a lot of one's time, they want incessant looking
after."
"And the most important force of all--the cement that holds
everything together--is their being ashamed of having an opinion
of their own."
That is a force!
"And whose work is it, whose precious
achievement is it, that not one idea of their own is left in their
heads!"
"They think originality a disgrace."""
"""If so, why do you take so much trouble?"""
"""Why, if people lie simply gaping at every one, how can you resist
annexing them?"
"Can you seriously refuse to believe in the possibility
of success?"
"Yes, you have the faith, but one wants will."
"It's just with
people like this that success is possible."
"I tell you I could make them
go through fire; one has only to din it into them that they are not
advanced enough."
"The fools reproach me that I have taken in every one
here over the central committee and 'the innumerable branches.'"
"You once
blamed me for it yourself, but where's the deception?"
"You and I are the
central committee and there will be as many branches as we like."""
"""And always the same sort of rabble!"""
"""Raw material."
"Even they will be of use."""
"""And you are still reckoning on me?"""
"""You are the chief, you are the head; I shall only be a subordinate,
your secretary."
"We shall take to our barque, you know; the oars are of
maple, the sails are of silk, at the helm sits a fair maiden, Lizaveta
Nikolaevna... hang it, how does it go in the ballad?"""
"""He is stuck,"" laughed Stavrogin."
"""No, I'd better give you my version."
There you reckon on your fingers the forces that make up the circles.
"All that business of titles and sentimentalism is a very good cement,
but there is something better; persuade four members of the circle to
do for a fifth on the pretence that he is a traitor, and you'll tie
them all together with the blood they've shed as though it were a knot."
"They'll be your slaves, they won't dare to rebel or call you to account."
"Ha ha ha!"""
"""But you... you shall pay for those words,"" Pyotr Stepanovitch thought
to himself, ""and this very evening, in fact."
"You go too far."""
"This or something like this must have been Pyotr Stepanovitch's
reflection."
They were approaching Virginsky's house.
"""You've represented me, no doubt, as a member from abroad, an inspector
in connection with the _Internationale?_"" Stavrogin asked suddenly."
"""No, not an inspector; you won't be an inspector; but you are one of
the original members from abroad, who knows the most important
secrets--that's your rôle."
"You are going to speak, of course?"""
"""What's put that idea into your head?"""
"""Now you are bound to speak."""
"Stavrogin positively stood still in the middle of the street in
surprise, not far from a street lamp."
"Pyotr Stepanovitch faced his
scrutiny calmly and defiantly."
Stavrogin cursed and went on.
"""And are you going to speak?"""
he suddenly asked Pyotr Stepanovitch.
"""No, I am going to listen to you."""
"""Damn you, you really are giving me an idea!"""
"""What idea?"""
Pyotr Stepanovitch asked quickly.
"""Perhaps I will speak there, but afterwards I will give you a
hiding--and a sound one too, you know."""
"""By the way, I told Karmazinov this morning that you said he ought to be
thrashed, and not simply as a form but to hurt, as they flog peasants."""
"""But I never said such a thing; ha ha!"""
"""No matter."
"_Se non è vero..._""

""Well, thanks."
"I am truly obliged."""
"""And another thing."
"Do you know, Karmazinov says that the essence of
our creed is the negation of honour, and that by the open advocacy of a
right to be dishonourable a Russian can be won over more easily than by
anything."""
"""An excellent saying!"
"Golden words!"""
cried Stavrogin.
"""He's hit the mark
there!"
"The right to dishonour--why, they'd all flock to us for that, not
one would stay behind!"
"And listen, Verhovensky, you are not one of the
higher police, are you?"""
"""Anyone who has a question like that in his mind doesn't utter it."""
"""I understand, but we are by ourselves."""
"""No, so far I am not one of the higher police."
"Enough, here we are."
"Compose your features, Stavrogin; I always do mine when I go in."
"A
gloomy expression, that's all, nothing more is wanted; it's a very
simple business."""
CHAPTER VII.
"A MEETING


I

VIRGINSKY LIVED IN HIS OWN house, or rather his wife's, in Muravyin
Street."
"It was a wooden house of one story, and there were no lodgers in
it."
"On the pretext of Virginsky's-name-day party, about fifteen guests
were assembled; but the entertainment was not in the least like an
ordinary provincial name-day party."
"From the very beginning of their
married life the husband and wife had agreed once for all that it was
utterly stupid to invite friends to celebrate name-days, and that ""there
is nothing to rejoice about in fact."""
"In a few years they had succeeded
in completely cutting themselves off from all society."
"Though he was
a man of some ability, and by no means very poor, he somehow seemed
to every one an eccentric fellow who was fond of solitude, and, what's
more, ""stuck up in conversation."""
"Madame Virginsky was a midwife by
profession--and by that very fact was on the lowest rung of the social
ladder, lower even than the priest's wife in spite of her husband's
rank as an officer."
"But she was conspicuously lacking in the humility
befitting her position."
"And after her very stupid and unpardonably open
liaison on principle with Captain Lebyadkin, a notorious rogue, even the
most indulgent of our ladies turned away from her with marked contempt."
"But Madame Virginsky accepted all this as though it were what she
wanted."
"It is remarkable that those very ladies applied to Arina
Prohorovna (that is, Madame Virginsky) when they were in an interesting
condition, rather than to any one of the other three _accoucheuses_ of
the town."
"She was sent for even by country families living in the
neighbourhood, so great was the belief in her knowledge, luck, and skill
in critical cases."
"It ended in her practising only among the wealthiest
ladies; she was greedy of money."
"Feeling her power to the full, she
ended by not putting herself out for anyone."
"Possibly on purpose,
indeed, in her practice in the best houses she used to scare nervous
patients by the most incredible and nihilistic disregard of good
manners, or by jeering at ""everything holy,"" at the very time when
""everything holy"" might have come in most useful."
"Our town doctor,
Rozanov--he too was an _accoucheur_--asserted most positively that on one
occasion when a patient in labour was crying out and calling on the name
of the Almighty, a free-thinking sally from Arina Prohorovna, fired off
like a pistol-shot, had so terrifying an effect on the patient that it
greatly accelerated her delivery."
"But though she was a nihilist, Madame Virginsky did not, when occasion
arose, disdain social or even old-fashioned superstitions and customs
if they could be of any advantage to herself."
"She would never, for
instance, have stayed away from a baby's christening, and always put on
a green silk dress with a train and adorned her chignon with curls and
ringlets for such events, though at other times she positively revelled
in slovenliness."
"And though during the ceremony she always maintained
""the most insolent air,"" so that she put the clergy to confusion, yet
when it was over she invariably handed champagne to the guests (it was
for that that she came and dressed up), and it was no use trying to take
the glass without a contribution to her ""porridge bowl."""
"The guests who assembled that evening at Virginsky's (mostly men) had a
casual and exceptional air."
There was no supper nor cards.
"In the middle
of the large drawing-room, which was papered with extremely old blue
paper, two tables had been put together and covered with a large though
not quite clean table-cloth, and on them two samovars were boiling."
"The
end of the table was taken up by a huge tray with twenty-five glasses on
it and a basket with ordinary French bread cut into a number of slices,
as one sees it in genteel boarding-schools for boys or girls."
"The tea
was poured out by a maiden lady of thirty, Arina Prohorovna's sister,
a silent and malevolent creature, with flaxen hair and no eyebrows, who
shared her sister's progressive ideas and was an object of terror to
Virginsky himself in domestic life."
"There were only three ladies in the
room: the lady of the house, her eyebrowless sister, and Virginsky's
sister, a girl who had just arrived from Petersburg."
"Arina Prohorovna, a
good-looking and buxom woman of seven-and-twenty, rather dishevelled, in
an everyday greenish woollen dress, was sitting scanning the guests with
her bold eyes, and her look seemed in haste to say, ""You see I am not
in the least afraid of anything."""
"Miss Virginsky, a rosy-cheeked student
and a nihilist, who was also good-looking, short, plump and round as a
little ball, had settled herself beside Arina Prohorovna, almost in
her travelling clothes."
"She held a roll of paper in her hand, and
scrutinised the guests with impatient and roving eyes."
"Virginsky himself
was rather unwell that evening, but he came in and sat in an easy chair
by the tea-table."
"All the guests were sitting down too, and the orderly
way in which they were ranged on chairs suggested a meeting."
"Evidently
all were expecting something and were filling up the interval with loud
but irrelevant conversation."
"When Stavrogin and Verhovensky appeared
there was a sudden hush."
But I must be allowed to give a few explanations to make things clear.
"I believe that all these people had come together in the agreeable
expectation of hearing something particularly interesting, and had
notice of it beforehand."
"They were the flower of the reddest Radicalism
of our ancient town, and had been carefully picked out by Virginsky for
this ""meeting."""
"I may remark, too, that some of them (though not very
many) had never visited him before."
"Of course most of the guests had no
clear idea why they had been summoned."
"It was true that at that time
all took Pyotr Stepanovitch for a fully authorised emissary from abroad;
this idea had somehow taken root among them at once and naturally
flattered them."
"And yet among the citizens assembled ostensibly to
keep a name-day, there were some who had been approached with definite
proposals."
"Pyotr Verhovensky had succeeded in getting together a
""quintet"" amongst us like the one he had already formed in Moscow and,
as appeared later, in our province among the officers."
"It was said that
he had another in X province."
"This quintet of the elect were sitting now
at the general table, and very skilfully succeeded in giving themselves
the air of being quite ordinary people, so that no one could have known
them."
"They were--since it is no longer a secret--first Liputin, then
Virginsky himself, then Shigalov (a gentleman with long ears, the
brother of Madame Virginsky), Lyamshin, and lastly a strange person
called Tolkatchenko, a man of forty, who was famed for his vast
knowledge of the people, especially of thieves and robbers."
"He used
to frequent the taverns on purpose (though not only with the object of
studying the people), and plumed himself on his shabby clothes, tarred
boots, and crafty wink and a flourish of peasant phrases."
"Lyamshin had
once or twice brought him to Stepan Trofimovitch's gatherings, where,
however, he did not make a great sensation."
"He used to make his
appearance in the town from time to time, chiefly when he was out of a
job; he was employed on the railway."
"Every one of these fine champions had formed this first group in the
fervent conviction that their quintet was only one of hundreds and
thousands of similar groups scattered all over Russia, and that they all
depended on some immense central but secret power, which in its turn was
intimately connected with the revolutionary movement all over Europe."
"But I regret to say that even at that time there was beginning to
be dissension among them."
"Though they had ever since the spring been
expecting Pyotr Verhovensky, whose coming had been heralded first
by Tolkatchenko and then by the arrival of Shigalov, though they had
expected extraordinary miracles from him, and though they had responded
to his first summons without the slightest criticism, yet they had no
sooner formed the quintet than they all somehow seemed to feel insulted;
and I really believe it was owing to the promptitude with which they
consented to join."
"They had joined, of course, from a not ignoble
feeling of shame, for fear people might say afterwards that they had
not dared to join; still they felt Pyotr Verhovensky ought to have
appreciated their heroism and have rewarded it by telling them some
really important bits of news at least."
"But Verhovensky was not at all
inclined to satisfy their legitimate curiosity, and told them nothing
but what was necessary; he treated them in general with great sternness
and even rather casually."
"This was positively irritating, and Comrade
Shigalov was already egging the others on to insist on his ""explaining
himself,"" though, of course, not at Virginsky's, where so many outsiders
were present."
"I have an idea that the above-mentioned members of the first quintet
were disposed to suspect that among the guests of Virginsky's that
evening some were members of other groups, unknown to them, belonging
to the same secret organisation and founded in the town by the same
Verhovensky; so that in fact all present were suspecting one another,
and posed in various ways to one another, which gave the whole party a
very perplexing and even romantic air."
"Yet there were persons present
who were beyond all suspicion."
"For instance, a major in the service, a
near relation of Virginsky, a perfectly innocent person who had not been
invited but had come of himself for the name-day celebration, so that it
was impossible not to receive him."
"But Virginsky was quite unperturbed,
as the major was ""incapable of betraying them""; for in spite of his
stupidity he had all his life been fond of dropping in wherever extreme
Radicals met; he did not sympathise with their ideas himself, but
was very fond of listening to them."
"What's more, he had even been
compromised indeed."
"It had happened in his youth that whole bundles of
manifestoes and of numbers of _The Bell_ had passed through his hands,
and although he had been afraid even to open them, yet he would have
considered it absolutely contemptible to refuse to distribute them--and
there are such people in Russia even to this day."
"The rest of the guests were either types of honourable amour-propre
crushed and embittered, or types of the generous impulsiveness of ardent
youth."
"There were two or three teachers, of whom one, a lame man of
forty-five, a master in the high school, was a very malicious and
strikingly vain person; and two or three officers."
"Of the latter, one
very young artillery officer who had only just come from a military
training school, a silent lad who had not yet made friends with anyone,
turned up now at Virginsky's with a pencil in his hand, and, scarcely
taking any part in the conversation, continually made notes in his
notebook."
"Everybody saw this, but every one pretended not to."
"There was,
too, an idle divinity student who had helped Lyamshin to put indecent
photographs into the gospel-woman's pack."
"He was a solid youth with a
free-and-easy though mistrustful manner, with an unchangeably satirical
smile, together with a calm air of triumphant faith in his own
perfection."
"There was also present, I don't know why, the mayor's son,
that unpleasant and prematurely exhausted youth to whom I have referred
already in telling the story of the lieutenant's little wife."
"He was
silent the whole evening."
"Finally there was a very enthusiastic and
tousle-headed schoolboy of eighteen, who sat with the gloomy air of a
young man whose dignity has been wounded, evidently distressed by his
eighteen years."
"This infant was already the head of an independent
group of conspirators which had been formed in the highest class of the
gymnasium, as it came out afterwards to the surprise of every one."
I haven't mentioned Shatov.
"He was there at the farthest corner of the
table, his chair pushed back a little out of the row."
"He gazed at the
ground, was gloomily silent, refused tea and bread, and did not for one
instant let his cap go out of his hand, as though to show that he was
not a visitor, but had come on business, and when he liked would get up
and go away."
Kirillov was not far from him.
"He, too, was very silent,
but he did not look at the ground; on the contrary, he scrutinised
intently every speaker with his fixed, lustreless eyes, and listened
to everything without the slightest emotion or surprise."
"Some of the
visitors who had never seen him before stole thoughtful glances at him."
"I can't say whether Madame Virginsky knew anything about the existence
of the quintet."
I imagine she knew everything and from her husband.
"The girl-student, of course, took no part in anything; but she had an
anxiety of her own: she intended to stay only a day or two and then to
go on farther and farther from one university town to another ""to show
active sympathy with the sufferings of poor students and to rouse
them to protest."""
"She was taking with her some hundreds of copies of a
lithographed appeal, I believe of her own composition."
"It is remarkable
that the schoolboy conceived an almost murderous hatred for her from the
first moment, though he saw her for the first time in his life; and she
felt the same for him."
"The major was her uncle, and met her to-day for
the first time after ten years."
"When Stavrogin and Verhovensky came in,
her cheeks were as red as cranberries: she had just quarrelled with her
uncle over his views on the woman question."
"II

With conspicuous nonchalance Verhovensky lounged in the chair at the
upper end of the table, almost without greeting anyone."
"His expression
was disdainful and even haughty."
"Stavrogin bowed politely, but in spite
of the fact that they were all only waiting for them, everybody, as
though acting on instruction, appeared scarcely to notice them."
"The lady
of the house turned severely to Stavrogin as soon as he was seated."
"""Stavrogin, will you have tea?"""
"""Please,"" he answered."
"""Tea for Stavrogin,"" she commanded her sister at the samovar."
"""And you,
will you?"""
(This was to Verhovensky.)
"""Of course."
What a question to ask a visitor!
"And give me cream too;
you always give one such filthy stuff by way of tea, and with a name-day
party in the house!"""
"""What, you believe in keeping name-days too!"""
"the girl-student laughed
suddenly."
"""We were just talking of that."""
"""That's stale,"" muttered the schoolboy at the other end of the table."
"""What's stale?"
"To disregard conventions, even the most innocent is not
stale; on the contrary, to the disgrace of every one, so far it's a
novelty,"" the girl-student answered instantly, darting forward on her
chair."
"""Besides, there are no innocent conventions,"" she added with
intensity."
"""I only meant,"" cried the schoolboy with tremendous excitement, ""to say
that though conventions of course are stale and must be eradicated, yet
about name-days everybody knows that they are stupid and very stale to
waste precious time upon, which has been wasted already all over the
world, so that it would be as well to sharpen one's wits on something
more useful....""

""You drag it out so, one can't understand what you mean,"" shouted the
girl."
"""I think that every one has a right to express an opinion as well as
every one else, and if I want to express my opinion like anybody
else...""

""No one is attacking your right to give an opinion,"" the lady of the
house herself cut in sharply."
"""You were only asked not to ramble because
no one can make out what you mean."""
"""But allow me to remark that you are not treating me with respect."
"If
I couldn't fully express my thought, it's not from want of thought
but from too much thought,"" the schoolboy muttered, almost in despair,
losing his thread completely."
"""If you don't know how to talk, you'd better keep quiet,"" blurted out
the girl."
The schoolboy positively jumped from his chair.
"""I only wanted to state,"" he shouted, crimson with shame and afraid
to look about him, ""that you only wanted to show off your cleverness
because Mr. Stavrogin came in--so there!"""
"""That's a nasty and immoral idea and shows the worthlessness of your
development."
"I beg you not to address me again,"" the girl rattled off."
"""Stavrogin,"" began the lady of the house, ""they've been discussing the
rights of the family before you came--this officer here""--she nodded
towards her relation, the major--""and, of course, I am not going to
worry you with such stale nonsense, which has been dealt with long
ago."
"But how have the rights and duties of the family come about in the
superstitious form in which they exist at present?"
That's the question.
"What's your opinion?"""
"""What do you mean by 'come about'?"""
Stavrogin asked in his turn.
"""We know, for instance, that the superstition about God came from
thunder and lightning."""
"The girl-student rushed into the fray again,
staring at Stavrogin with her eyes almost jumping out of her head."
"""It's
well known that primitive man, scared by thunder and lightning, made a
god of the unseen enemy, feeling their weakness before it."
"But how did
the superstition of the family arise?"
"How did the family itself arise?"""
"""That's not quite the same thing...."" Madame Virginsky tried to check
her."
"""I think the answer to this question wouldn't be quite discreet,""
answered Stavrogin."
"""How so?"""
"said the girl-student, craning forward suddenly."
"But there was
an audible titter in the group of teachers, which was at once caught up
at the other end by Lyamshin and the schoolboy and followed by a hoarse
chuckle from the major."
"""You ought to write vaudevilles,"" Madame Virginsky observed to
Stavrogin."
"""It does you no credit, I don't know what your name is,"" the girl rapped
out with positive indignation."
"""And don't you be too forward,"" boomed the major."
"""You are a young lady
and you ought to behave modestly, and you keep jumping about as though
you were sitting on a needle."""
"""Kindly hold your tongue and don't address me familiarly with your
nasty comparisons."
"I've never seen you before and I don't recognise the
relationship."""
"""But I am your uncle; I used to carry you about when you were a baby!"""
"""I don't care what babies you used to carry about."
"I didn't ask you
to carry me."
"It must have been a pleasure to you to do so, you
rude officer."
"And allow me to observe, don't dare to address me so
familiarly, unless it's as a fellow-citizen."
"I forbid you to do it, once
for all."""
"""There, they are all like that!"""
"cried the major, banging the table with
his fist and addressing Stavrogin, who was sitting opposite."
"""But, allow
me, I am fond of Liberalism and modern ideas, and I am fond of listening
to clever conversation; masculine conversation, though, I warn you."
"But
to listen to these women, these nightly windmills--no, that makes me
ache all over!"
"Don't wriggle about!"""
"he shouted to the girl, who
was leaping up from her chair."
"""No, it's my turn to speak, I've been
insulted."""
"""You can't say anything yourself, and only hinder other people talking,""
the lady of the house grumbled indignantly."
"""No, I will have my say,"" said the major hotly, addressing Stavrogin."
"""I
reckon on you, Mr. Stavrogin, as a fresh person who has only just come
on the scene, though I haven't the honour of knowing you."
"Without men
they'll perish like flies--that's what I think."
"All their woman question
is only lack of originality."
"I assure you that all this woman question
has been invented for them by men in foolishness and to their own hurt."
I only thank God I am not married.
"There's not the slightest variety in
them, they can't even invent a simple pattern; they have to get men to
invent them for them!"
"Here I used to carry her in my arms, used to dance
the mazurka with her when she was ten years old; to-day she's come,
naturally I fly to embrace her, and at the second word she tells me
there's no God."
"She might have waited a little, she was in too great a
hurry!"
"Clever people don't believe, I dare say; but that's from their
cleverness."
"But you, chicken, what do you know about God, I said to
her."
"'Some student taught you, and if he'd taught you to light the lamp
before the ikons you would have lighted it.'"""
"""You keep telling lies, you are a very spiteful person."
"I proved to
you just now the untenability of your position,"" the girl answered
contemptuously, as though disdaining further explanations with such a
man."
"""I told you just now that we've all been taught in the Catechism
if you honour your father and your parents you will live long and have
wealth."
That's in the Ten Commandments.
"If God thought it necessary to
offer rewards for love, your God must be immoral."
"That's how I proved it
to you."
"It wasn't the second word, and it was because you asserted your
rights."
"It's not my fault if you are stupid and don't understand even
now."
"You are offended and you are spiteful--and that's what explains all
your generation."""
"""You're a goose!"""
said the major.
"""And you are a fool!"""
"""You can call me names!"""
"""Excuse me, Kapiton Maximitch, you told me yourself you don't believe in
God,"" Liputin piped from the other end of the table."
"""What if I did say so--that's a different matter."
"I believe, perhaps,
only not altogether."
"Even if I don't believe altogether, still I don't
say God ought to be shot."
"I used to think about God before I left the
hussars."
"From all the poems you would think that hussars do nothing but
carouse and drink."
"Yes, I did drink, maybe, but would you believe it,
I used to jump out of bed at night and stood crossing myself before the
images with nothing but my socks on, praying to God to give me faith;
for even then I couldn't be at peace as to whether there was a God or
not."
It used to fret me so!
"In the morning, of course, one would amuse
oneself and one's faith would seem to be lost again; and in fact I've
noticed that faith always seems to be less in the daytime."""
"""Haven't you any cards?"""
"asked Verhovensky, with a mighty yawn,
addressing Madame Virginsky."
"""I sympathise with your question, I sympathise entirely,"" the
girl-student broke in hotly, flushed with indignation at the major's
words."
"""We are wasting precious time listening to silly talk,"" snapped out the
lady of the house, and she looked reprovingly at her husband."
The girl pulled herself together.
"""I wanted to make a statement to the meeting concerning the sufferings
of the students and their protest, but as time is being wasted in
immoral conversation...""

""There's no such thing as moral or immoral,"" the schoolboy brought out,
unable to restrain himself as soon as the girl began."
"""I knew that, Mr. Schoolboy, long before you were taught it."""
"""And I maintain,"" he answered savagely, ""that you are a child come
from Petersburg to enlighten us all, though we know for ourselves the
commandment 'honour thy father and thy mother,' which you could not
repeat correctly; and the fact that it's immoral every one in Russia
knows from Byelinsky."""
"""Are we ever to have an end of this?"""
"Madame Virginsky said resolutely
to her husband."
"As the hostess, she blushed for the ineptitude of the
conversation, especially as she noticed smiles and even astonishment
among the guests who had been invited for the first time."
"""Gentlemen,"" said Virginsky, suddenly lifting up his voice, ""if anyone
wishes to say anything more nearly connected with our business, or has
any statement to make, I call upon him to do so without wasting time."""
"""I'll venture to ask one question,"" said the lame teacher suavely."
"He
had been sitting particularly decorously and had not spoken till then."
"""I should like to know, are we some sort of meeting, or are we simply a
gathering of ordinary mortals paying a visit?"
"I ask simply for the sake
of order and so as not to remain in ignorance."""
"This ""sly"" question made an impression."
"People looked at each other,
every one expecting someone else to answer, and suddenly all, as though
at a word of command, turned their eyes to Verhovensky and Stavrogin."
"""I suggest our voting on the answer to the question whether we are a
meeting or not,"" said Madame Virginsky."
"""I entirely agree with the suggestion,"" Liputin chimed in, ""though the
question is rather vague."""
"""I agree too."""
"""And so do I,"" cried voices."
"""I too think it would make our proceedings
more in order,"" confirmed Virginsky."
"""To the vote then,"" said his wife."
"""Lyamshin, please sit down to the
piano; you can give your vote from there when the voting begins."""
"""Again!"""
cried Lyamshin.
"""I've strummed enough for you."""
"""I beg you most particularly, sit down and play."
"Don't you care to do
anything for the cause?"""
"""But I assure you, Arina Prohorovna, nobody is eavesdropping."
"It's
only your fancy."
"Besides, the windows are high, and people would not
understand if they did hear."""
"""We don't understand ourselves,"" someone muttered."
"""But I tell you one
must always be on one's guard."
"I mean in case there should be spies,""
she explained to Verhovensky."
"""Let them hear from the street that we
have music and a name-day party."""
"""Hang it all!"""
"Lyamshin swore, and sitting down to the piano, began
strumming a valse, banging on the keys almost with his fists, at random."
"""I propose that those who want it to be a meeting should put up their
right hands,"" Madame Virginsky proposed."
"Some put them up, others did not."
"Some held them up and then put them
down again and then held them up again."
"""Foo!"
"I don't understand it at
all,"" one officer shouted."
"""I don't either,"" cried the other."
"""Oh, I understand,"" cried a third."
"""If it's yes, you hold your hand up."""
"""But what does 'yes' mean?"""
"""Means a meeting."""
"""No, it means not a meeting."""
"""I voted for a meeting,"" cried the schoolboy to Madame Virginsky."
"""Then why didn't you hold up your hand?"""
"""I was looking at you."
"You didn't hold up yours, so I didn't hold up
mine."""
"""How stupid!"
I didn't hold up my hand because I proposed it.
"Gentlemen,
now I propose the contrary."
"Those who want a meeting, sit still and do
nothing; those who don't, hold up their right hands."""
"""Those who don't want it?"""
inquired the schoolboy.
"""Are you doing it on
purpose?"""
cried Madame Virginsky wrathfully.
"""No."
"Excuse me, those who want it, or those who don't want it?"
"For one
must know that definitely,"" cried two or three voices."
"""Those who don't want it--those who _don't_ want it."""
"""Yes, but what is one to do, hold up one's hand or not hold it up if one
doesn't want it?"""
cried an officer.
"""Ech, we are not accustomed to constitutional methods yet!"""
"remarked the
major."
"""Mr. Lyamshin, excuse me, but you are thumping so that no one can hear
anything,"" observed the lame teacher."
"""But, upon my word, Arina Prohorovna, nobody is listening, really!"""
"cried Lyamshin, jumping up."
"""I won't play!"
"I've come to you as a
visitor, not as a drummer!"""
"""Gentlemen,"" Virginsky went on, ""answer verbally, are we a meeting or
not?"""
"""We are!"
"We are!"""
was heard on all sides.
"""If so, there's no need to
vote, that's enough."
"Are you satisfied, gentlemen?"
"Is there any need to
put it to the vote?"""
"""No need--no need, we understand."""
"""Perhaps someone doesn't want it to be a meeting?"""
"""No, no; we all want it."""
"""But what does 'meeting' mean?"""
cried a voice.
No one answered.
"""We must choose a chairman,"" people cried from different parts of the
room."
"""Our host, of course, our host!"""
"""Gentlemen, if so,"" Virginsky, the chosen chairman, began, ""I propose
my original motion."
"If anyone wants to say anything more relevant to the
subject, or has some statement to make, let him bring it forward without
loss of time."""
There was a general silence.
"The eyes of all were turned again on
Verhovensky and Stavrogin."
"""Verhovensky, have you no statement to make?"""
"Madame Virginsky asked him
directly."
"""Nothing whatever,"" he answered, yawning and stretching on his chair."
"""But I should like a glass of brandy."""
"""Stavrogin, don't you want to?"""
"""Thank you, I don't drink."""
"""I mean don't you want to speak, not don't you want brandy."""
"""To speak, what about?"
"No, I don't want to."""
"""They'll bring you some brandy,"" she answered Verhovensky."
The girl-student got up.
She had darted up several times already.
"""I have come to make a statement about the sufferings of poor students
and the means of rousing them to protest."""
But she broke off.
"At the other end of the table a rival had risen, and
all eyes turned to him."
"Shigalov, the man with the long ears, slowly
rose from his seat with a gloomy and sullen air and mournfully laid on
the table a thick notebook filled with extremely small handwriting."
He remained standing in silence.
"Many people looked at the notebook
in consternation, but Liputin, Virginsky, and the lame teacher seemed
pleased."
"""I ask leave to address the meeting,"" Shigalov pronounced sullenly but
resolutely."
"""You have leave."""
Virginsky gave his sanction.
"The orator sat down, was silent for half a minute, and pronounced in a
solemn voice,

""Gentlemen!"""
"""Here's the brandy,"" the sister who had been pouring out tea and had
gone to fetch brandy rapped out, contemptuously and disdainfully putting
the bottle before Verhovensky, together with the wineglass which she
brought in her fingers without a tray or a plate."
The interrupted orator made a dignified pause.
"""Never mind, go on, I am not listening,"" cried Verhovensky, pouring
himself out a glass."
"""Gentlemen, asking your attention and, as you will see later, soliciting
your aid in a matter of the first importance,"" Shigalov began again, ""I
must make some prefatory remarks."""
"""Arina Prohorovna, haven't you some scissors?"""
"Pyotr Stepanovitch asked
suddenly."
"""What do you want scissors for?"""
"she asked, with wide-open eyes."
"""I've forgotten to cut my nails; I've been meaning to for the last three
days,"" he observed, scrutinising his long and dirty nails with unruffled
composure."
"Arina Prohorovna crimsoned, but Miss Virginsky seemed pleased."
"""I believe I saw them just now on the window."""
"She got up from the
table, went and found the scissors, and at once brought them."
"Pyotr
Stepanovitch did not even look at her, took the scissors, and set to
work with them."
"Arina Prohorovna grasped that these were realistic
manners, and was ashamed of her sensitiveness."
"People looked at one
another in silence."
"The lame teacher looked vindictively and enviously
at Verhovensky."
Shigalov went on.
"""Dedicating my energies to the study of the social organisation which is
in the future to replace the present condition of things, I've come to
the conviction that all makers of social systems from ancient times up
to the present year, 187-, have been dreamers, tellers of fairy-tales,
fools who contradicted themselves, who understood nothing of natural
science and the strange animal called man."
"Plato, Rousseau, Fourier,
columns of aluminium, are only fit for sparrows and not for human
society."
"But, now that we are all at last preparing to act, a new
form of social organisation is essential."
"In order to avoid further
uncertainty, I propose my own system of world-organisation."
"Here it is."""
He tapped the notebook.
"""I wanted to expound my views to the meeting in
the most concise form possible, but I see that I should need to add a
great many verbal explanations, and so the whole exposition would occupy
at least ten evenings, one for each of my chapters."""
"(There was the
sound of laughter.)"
"""I must add, besides, that my system is not yet
complete."""
(Laughter again.)
"""I am perplexed by my own data and my
conclusion is a direct contradiction of the original idea with which I
start."
"Starting from unlimited freedom, I arrive at unlimited despotism."
"I will add, however, that there can be no solution of the social problem
but mine."""
"The laughter grew louder and louder, but it came chiefly from the
younger and less initiated visitors."
"There was an expression of some
annoyance on the faces of Madame Virginsky, Liputin, and the lame
teacher."
"""If you've been unsuccessful in making your system consistent, and have
been reduced to despair yourself, what could we do with it?"""
"one officer
observed warily."
"""You are right, Mr."
"Officer""--Shigalov turned sharply to
him--""especially in using the word despair."
"Yes, I am reduced to despair."
"Nevertheless, nothing can take the place of the system set forth in my
book, and there is no other way out of it; no one can invent anything
else."
"And so I hasten without loss of time to invite the whole society
to listen for ten evenings to my book and then give their opinions of
it."
"If the members are unwilling to listen to me, let us break up from
the start--the men to take up service under government, the women to
their cooking; for if you reject my solution you'll find no other, none
whatever!"
"If they let the opportunity slip, it will simply be their
loss, for they will be bound to come back to it again."""
There was a stir in the company.
"""Is he mad, or what?"""
voices asked.
"""So the whole point lies in Shigalov's despair,"" Lyamshin commented,
""and the essential question is whether he must despair or not?"""
"""Shigalov's being on the brink of despair is a personal question,""
declared the schoolboy."
"""I propose we put it to the vote how far Shigalov's despair affects the
common cause, and at the same time whether it's worth while listening to
him or not,"" an officer suggested gaily."
"""That's not right."""
The lame teacher put in his spoke at last.
"As a rule
he spoke with a rather mocking smile, so that it was difficult to make
out whether he was in earnest or joking."
"""That's not right, gentlemen."
Mr. Shigalov is too much devoted to his task and is also too modest.
I know his book.
"He suggests as a final solution of the question the
division of mankind into two unequal parts."
"One-tenth enjoys absolute
liberty and unbounded power over the other nine-tenths."
"The others
have to give up all individuality and become, so to speak, a herd, and,
through boundless submission, will by a series of regenerations attain
primæval innocence, something like the Garden of Eden."
"They'll have
to work, however."
"The measures proposed by the author for depriving
nine-tenths of mankind of their freedom and transforming them into a
herd through the education of whole generations are very remarkable,
founded on the facts of nature and highly logical."
"One may not agree
with some of the deductions, but it would be difficult to doubt the
intelligence and knowledge of the author."
"It's a pity that the time
required--ten evenings--is impossible to arrange for, or we might hear a
great deal that's interesting."""
"""Can you be in earnest?"""
"Madame Virginsky addressed the lame gentleman
with a shade of positive uneasiness in her voice, ""when that man doesn't
know what to do with people and so turns nine-tenths of them into
slaves?"
"I've suspected him for a long time."""
"""You say that of your own brother?"""
asked the lame man.
"""Relationship?"
"Are you laughing at me?"""
"""And besides, to work for aristocrats and to obey them as though they
were gods is contemptible!"""
observed the girl-student fiercely.
"""What I propose is not contemptible; it's paradise, an earthly
paradise, and there can be no other on earth,"" Shigalov pronounced
authoritatively."
"""For my part,"" said Lyamshin, ""if I didn't know what to do with
nine-tenths of mankind, I'd take them and blow them up into the air
instead of putting them in paradise."
"I'd only leave a handful of
educated people, who would live happily ever afterwards on scientific
principles."""
"""No one but a buffoon can talk like that!"""
"cried the girl, flaring up."
"""He is a buffoon, but he is of use,"" Madame Virginsky whispered to her."
"""And possibly that would be the best solution of the problem,"" said
Shigalov, turning hotly to Lyamshin."
"""You certainly don't know what a
profound thing you've succeeded in saying, my merry friend."
"But as it's
hardly possible to carry out your idea, we must confine ourselves to an
earthly paradise, since that's what they call it."""
"""This is pretty thorough rot,"" broke, as though involuntarily, from
Verhovensky."
"Without even raising his eyes, however, he went on cutting
his nails with perfect nonchalance."
"""Why is it rot?"""
"The lame man took it up instantly, as though he had
been lying in wait for his first words to catch at them."
"""Why is it
rot?"
"Mr. Shigalov is somewhat fanatical in his love for humanity, but
remember that Fourier, still more Cabet and even Proudhon himself,
advocated a number of the most despotic and even fantastic measures."
"Mr.
Shigalov is perhaps far more sober in his suggestions than they are."
"I
assure you that when one reads his book it's almost impossible not to
agree with some things."
"He is perhaps less far from realism than anyone
and his earthly paradise is almost the real one--if it ever existed--for
the loss of which man is always sighing."""
"""I knew I was in for something,"" Verhovensky muttered again."
"""Allow me,"" said the lame man, getting more and more excited."
"""Conversations and arguments about the future organisation of society
are almost an actual necessity for all thinking people nowadays."
"Herzen
was occupied with nothing else all his life."
"Byelinsky, as I know on
very good authority, used to spend whole evenings with his friends
debating and settling beforehand even the minutest, so to speak,
domestic, details of the social organisation of the future."""
"""Some people go crazy over it,"" the major observed suddenly."
"""We are more likely to arrive at something by talking, anyway, than by
sitting silent and posing as dictators,"" Liputin hissed, as though at
last venturing to begin the attack."
"""I didn't mean Shigalov when I said it was rot,"" Verhovensky mumbled."
"""You see, gentlemen,""--he raised his eyes a trifle--""to my mind all
these books, Fourier, Cabet, all this talk about the right to work,
and Shigalov's theories--are all like novels of which one can write a
hundred thousand--an æsthetic entertainment."
"I can understand that in
this little town you are bored, so you rush to ink and paper."""
"""Excuse me,"" said the lame man, wriggling on his chair, ""though we are
provincials and of course objects of commiseration on that ground, yet
we know that so far nothing has happened in the world new enough to be
worth our weeping at having missed it."
"It is suggested to us in various
pamphlets made abroad and secretly distributed that we should unite
and form groups with the sole object of bringing about universal
destruction."
"It's urged that, however much you tinker with the world,
you can't make a good job of it, but that by cutting off a hundred
million heads and so lightening one's burden, one can jump over the
ditch more safely."
"A fine idea, no doubt, but quite as impracticable as
Shigalov's theories, which you referred to just now so contemptuously."""
"""Well, but I haven't come here for discussion."""
"Verhovensky let drop
this significant phrase, and, as though quite unaware of his blunder,
drew the candle nearer to him that he might see better."
"""It's a pity, a great pity, that you haven't come for discussion, and
it's a great pity that you are so taken up just now with your toilet."""
"""What's my toilet to you?"""
"""To remove a hundred million heads is as difficult as to transform the
world by propaganda."
"Possibly more difficult, especially in Russia,""
Liputin ventured again."
"""It's Russia they rest their hopes on now,"" said an officer."
"""We've heard they are resting their hopes on it,"" interposed the lame
man."
"""We know that a mysterious finger is pointing to our delightful
country as the land most fitted to accomplish the great task."
"But
there's this: by the gradual solution of the problem by propaganda I
shall gain something, anyway--I shall have some pleasant talk, at least,
and shall even get some recognition from government for my services
to the cause of society."
"But in the second way, by the rapid method
of cutting off a hundred million heads, what benefit shall I get
personally?"
"If you began advocating that, your tongue might be cut out."""
"""Yours certainly would be,"" observed Verhovensky."
"""You see."
"And as under the most favourable circumstances you would not
get through such a massacre in less than fifty or at the best thirty
years--for they are not sheep, you know, and perhaps they would not let
themselves be slaughtered--wouldn't it be better to pack one's bundle
and migrate to some quiet island beyond calm seas and there close one's
eyes tranquilly?"
"Believe me""--he tapped the table significantly with his
finger--""you will only promote emigration by such propaganda and nothing
else!"""
He finished evidently triumphant.
"He was one of the intellects of the
province."
"Liputin smiled slyly, Virginsky listened rather dejectedly,
the others followed the discussion with great attention, especially the
ladies and officers."
"They all realised that the advocate of the hundred
million heads theory had been driven into a corner, and waited to see
what would come of it."
"""That was a good saying of yours, though,"" Verhovensky mumbled
more carelessly than ever, in fact with an air of positive boredom."
"""Emigration is a good idea."
"But all the same, if in spite of all the
obvious disadvantages you foresee, more and more come forward every day
ready to fight for the common cause, it will be able to do without you."
"It's a new religion, my good friend, coming to take the place of the old
one."
"That's why so many fighters come forward, and it's a big movement."
You'd better emigrate!
"And, you know, I should advise Dresden, not 'the
calm islands.'"
"To begin with, it's a town that has never been visited by
an epidemic, and as you are a man of culture, no doubt you are afraid
of death."
"Another thing, it's near the Russian frontier, so you can more
easily receive your income from your beloved Fatherland."
"Thirdly,
it contains what are called treasures of art, and you are a man of
æsthetic tastes, formerly a teacher of literature, I believe."
"And,
finally, it has a miniature Switzerland of its own--to provide you
with poetic inspiration, for no doubt you write verse."
"In fact it's a
treasure in a nutshell!"""
"There was a general movement, especially among
the officers."
"In another instant they would have all begun talking at
once."
But the lame man rose irritably to the bait.
"""No, perhaps I am not going to give up the common cause."
"You must
understand that...""

""What, would you join the quintet if I proposed it to you?"""
"Verhovensky
boomed suddenly, and he laid down the scissors."
Every one seemed startled.
"The mysterious man had revealed himself too
freely."
"He had even spoken openly of the ""quintet."""
"""Every one feels himself to be an honest man and will not shirk his part
in the common cause""--the lame man tried to wriggle out of it--""but...""

""No, this is not a question which allows of a _but_,"" Verhovensky
interrupted harshly and peremptorily."
"""I tell you, gentlemen, I must
have a direct answer."
"I quite understand that, having come here and
having called you together myself, I am bound to give you explanations""
(again an unexpected revelation), ""but I can give you none till I know
what is your attitude to the subject."
"To cut the matter short--for we
can't go on talking for another thirty years as people have done for the
last thirty--I ask you which you prefer: the slow way, which consists in
the composition of socialistic romances and the academic ordering of
the destinies of humanity a thousand years hence, while despotism will
swallow the savoury morsels which would almost fly into your mouths of
themselves if you'd take a little trouble; or do you, whatever it may
imply, prefer a quicker way which will at last untie your hands, and
will let humanity make its own social organisation in freedom and in
action, not on paper?"
"They shout 'a hundred million heads'; that may be
only a metaphor; but why be afraid of it if, with the slow day-dream on
paper, despotism in the course of some hundred years will devour not a
hundred but five hundred million heads?"
"Take note too that an incurable
invalid will not be cured whatever prescriptions are written for him on
paper."
"On the contrary, if there is delay, he will grow so corrupt that
he will infect us too and contaminate all the fresh forces which one
might still reckon upon now, so that we shall all at last come to grief
together."
"I thoroughly agree that it's extremely agreeable to chatter
liberally and eloquently, but action is a little trying...."
"However, I
am no hand at talking; I came here with communications, and so I beg
all the honourable company not to vote, but simply and directly to state
which you prefer: walking at a snail's pace in the marsh, or putting on
full steam to get across it?"""
"""I am certainly for crossing at full steam!"""
"cried the schoolboy in an
ecstasy."
"""So am I,"" Lyamshin chimed in."
"""There can be no doubt about the choice,"" muttered an officer, followed
by another, then by someone else."
"What struck them all most was that
Verhovensky had come ""with communications"" and had himself just promised
to speak."
"""Gentlemen, I see that almost all decide for the policy of the
manifestoes,"" he said, looking round at the company."
"""All, all!"""
cried the majority of voices.
"""I confess I am rather in favour of a more humane policy,"" said the
major, ""but as all are on the other side, I go with all the rest."""
"""It appears, then, that even you are not opposed to it,"" said
Verhovensky, addressing the lame man."
"""I am not exactly..."" said the latter, turning rather red, ""but if I do
agree with the rest now, it's simply not to break up--""

""You are all like that!"
"Ready to argue for six months to practise
your Liberal eloquence and in the end you vote the same as the rest!"
"Gentlemen, consider though, is it true that you are all ready?"""
(Ready for what?
"The question was vague, but very alluring.)"
"""All are, of course!"""
voices were heard.
"But all were looking at one
another."
"""But afterwards perhaps you will resent having agreed so quickly?"
"That's
almost always the way with you."""
"The company was excited in various ways, greatly excited."
"The lame man
flew at him."
"""Allow me to observe, however, that answers to such questions are
conditional."
"Even if we have given our decision, you must note that
questions put in such a strange way...""

""In what strange way?"""
"""In a way such questions are not asked."""
"""Teach me how, please."
"But do you know, I felt sure you'd be the first
to take offence."""
"""You've extracted from us an answer as to our readiness for immediate
action; but what right had you to do so?"
"By what authority do you ask
such questions?"""
"""You should have thought of asking that question sooner!"
"Why did you
answer?"
"You agree and then you go back on it!"""
"""But to my mind the irresponsibility of your principal question suggests
to me that you have no authority, no right, and only asked from personal
curiosity."""
"""What do you mean?"
"What do you mean?"""
"cried Verhovensky, apparently
beginning to be much alarmed."
"""Why, that the initiation of new members into anything you like is done,
anyway, _tête-à-tête_ and not in the company of twenty people one doesn't
know!"""
blurted out the lame man.
"He had said all that was in his mind
because he was too irritated to restrain himself."
"Verhovensky turned to
the general company with a capitally simulated look of alarm."
"""Gentlemen, I deem it my duty to declare that all this is folly, and
that our conversation has gone too far."
"I have so far initiated no one,
and no one has the right to say of me that I initiate members."
"We were
simply discussing our opinions."
"That's so, isn't it?"
"But whether that's
so or not, you alarm me very much."""
He turned to the lame man again.
"""I had no idea that it was unsafe here to speak of such practically
innocent matters except _tête-à-tête_."
Are you afraid of informers?
"Can
there possibly be an informer among us here?"""
The excitement became tremendous; all began talking.
"""Gentlemen, if that is so,"" Verhovensky went on, ""I have compromised
myself more than anyone, and so I will ask you to answer one question,
if you care to, of course."
"You are all perfectly free."""
"""What question?"
"What question?"""
every one clamoured.
"""A question that will make it clear whether we are to remain together,
or take up our hats and go our several ways without speaking."""
"""The question!"
"The question!"""
"""If any one of us knew of a proposed political murder, would he, in view
of all the consequences, go to give information, or would he stay at
home and await events?"
Opinions may differ on this point.
"The answer
to the question will tell us clearly whether we are to separate, or to
remain together and for far longer than this one evening."
"Let me appeal
to you first."""
He turned to the lame man.
"""Why to me first?"""
"""Because you began it all."
"Be so good as not to prevaricate; it won't
help you to be cunning."
"But please yourself, it's for you to decide."""
"""Excuse me, but such a question is positively insulting."""
"""No, can't you be more exact than that?"""
"""I've never been an agent of the Secret Police,"" replied the latter,
wriggling more than ever."
"""Be so good as to be more definite, don't keep us waiting."""
The lame man was so furious that he left off answering.
"Without a word
he glared wrathfully from under his spectacles at his tormentor."
"""Yes or no?"
"Would you inform or not?"""
cried Verhovensky.
"""Of course I wouldn't,"" the lame man shouted twice as loudly."
"""And no one would, of course not!"""
cried many voices.
"""Allow me to appeal to you, Mr. Major."
"Would you inform or not?"""
Verhovensky went on.
"""And note that I appeal to you on purpose."""
"""I won't inform."""
"""But if you knew that someone meant to rob and murder someone else, an
ordinary mortal, then you would inform and give warning?"""
"""Yes, of course; but that's a private affair, while the other would be a
political treachery."
"I've never been an agent of the Secret Police."""
"""And no one here has,"" voices cried again."
"""It's an unnecessary
question."
Every one will make the same answer.
"There are no informers
here."""
"""What is that gentleman getting up for?"""
cried the girl-student.
"""That's Shatov."
"What are you getting up for?"""
"cried the lady of the
house."
"Shatov did, in fact, stand up."
"He was holding his cap in his hand and
looking at Verhovensky."
"Apparently he wanted to say something to him,
but was hesitating."
"His face was pale and wrathful, but he controlled
himself."
"He did not say one word, but in silence walked towards the
door."
"""Shatov, this won't make things better for you!"""
"Verhovensky called
after him enigmatically."
"""But it will for you, since you are a spy and a scoundrel!"""
"Shatov
shouted to him from the door, and he went out."
Shouts and exclamations again.
"""That's what comes of a test,"" cried a voice."
"""It's been of use,"" cried another."
"""Hasn't it been of use too late?"""
observed a third.
"""Who invited him?"
Who let him in?
Who is he?
Who is Shatov?
"Will he
inform, or won't he?"""
There was a shower of questions.
"""If he were an informer he would have kept up appearances instead of
cursing it all and going away,"" observed someone."
"""See, Stavrogin is getting up too."
"Stavrogin has not answered the
question either,"" cried the girl-student."
"Stavrogin did actually stand up, and at the other end of the table
Kirillov rose at the same time."
"""Excuse me, Mr. Stavrogin,"" Madame Virginsky addressed him sharply, ""we
all answered the question, while you are going away without a word."""
"""I see no necessity to answer the question which interests you,""
muttered Stavrogin."
"""But we've compromised ourselves and you won't,"" shouted several voices."
"""What business is it of mine if you have compromised yourselves?"""
"laughed Stavrogin, but his eyes flashed."
"""What business?"
"What business?"""
voices exclaimed.
Many people got up from their chairs.
"""Allow me, gentlemen, allow me,"" cried the lame man."
"""Mr. Verhovensky
hasn't answered the question either; he has only asked it."""
The remark produced a striking effect.
All looked at one another.
"Stavrogin laughed aloud in the lame man's face and went out; Kirillov
followed him; Verhovensky ran after them into the passage."
"""What are you doing?"""
"he faltered, seizing Stavrogin's hand and gripping
it with all his might in his."
"Stavrogin pulled away his hand without a
word."
"""Be at Kirillov's directly, I'll come...."
"It's absolutely necessary
for me to see you!..."""
"""It isn't necessary for me,"" Stavrogin cut him short."
"""Stavrogin will be there,"" Kirillov said finally."
"""Stavrogin, it is
necessary for you."
"I will show you that there."""
They went out.
CHAPTER VIII.
"IVAN THE TSAREVITCH


They had gone."
"Pyotr Stepanovitch was about to rush back to the meeting
to bring order into chaos, but probably reflecting that it wasn't worth
bothering about, left everything, and two minutes later was flying after
the other two."
On the way he remembered a short cut to Filipov's house.
"He rushed along it, up to his knees in mud, and did in fact arrive at
the very moment when Stavrogin and Kirillov were coming in at the gate."
"""You here already?"""
observed Kirillov.
"""That's good."
"Come in."""
"""How is it you told us you lived alone,"" asked Stavrogin, passing a
boiling samovar in the passage."
"""You will see directly who it is I live with,"" muttered Kirillov."
"""Go
in."""
"They had hardly entered when Verhovensky at once took out of his pocket
the anonymous letter he had taken from Lembke, and laid it before
Stavrogin."
They all then sat down.
Stavrogin read the letter in silence.
"""Well?"""
he asked.
"""That scoundrel will do as he writes,"" Verhovensky explained."
"""So, as
he is under your control, tell me how to act."
"I assure you he may go to
Lembke to-morrow."""
"""Well, let him go."""
"""Let him go!"
"And when we can prevent him, too!"""
"""You are mistaken."
He is not dependent on me.
"Besides, I don't care; he
doesn't threaten me in any way; he only threatens you."""
"""You too."""
"""I don't think so."""
"""But there are other people who may not spare you."
"Surely you understand
that?"
"Listen, Stavrogin."
This is only playing with words.
"Surely you
don't grudge the money?"""
"""Why, would it cost money?"""
"""It certainly would; two thousand or at least fifteen hundred."
"Give it
to me to-morrow or even to-day, and to-morrow evening I'll send him to
Petersburg for you."
That's just what he wants.
"If you like, he can take
Marya Timofyevna."
"Note that."""
There was something distracted about him.
"He spoke, as it were, without
caution, and he did not reflect on his words."
"Stavrogin watched him,
wondering."
"""I've no reason to send Marya Timofyevna away."""
"""Perhaps you don't even want to,"" Pyotr Stepanovitch smiled ironically."
"""Perhaps I don't."""
"""In short, will there be the money or not?"""
"he cried with angry
impatience, and as it were peremptorily, to Stavrogin."
"The latter
scrutinised him gravely."
"""There won't be the money."""
"""Look here, Stavrogin!"
"You know something, or have done something
already!"
"You are going it!"""
"His face worked, the corners of his mouth twitched, and he suddenly
laughed an unprovoked and irrelevant laugh."
"""But you've had money from your father for the estate,"" Stavrogin
observed calmly."
"""Maman sent you six or eight thousand for Stepan
Trofimovitch."
So you can pay the fifteen hundred out of your own money.
I don't care to pay for other people.
I've given a lot as it is.
"It annoys me...."" He smiled himself at his own words."
"""Ah, you are beginning to joke!"""
Stavrogin got up from his chair.
"Verhovensky instantly jumped up too,
and mechanically stood with his back to the door as though barring the
way to him."
"Stavrogin had already made a motion to push him aside and go
out, when he stopped short."
"""I won't give up Shatov to you,"" he said."
Pyotr Stepanovitch started.
They looked at one another.
"""I told you this evening why you needed Shatov's blood,"" said Stavrogin,
with flashing eyes."
"""It's the cement you want to bind your groups
together with."
You drove Shatov away cleverly just now.
"You knew very
well that he wouldn't promise not to inform and he would have thought it
mean to lie to you."
But what do you want with me?
"What do you want with
me?"
Ever since we met abroad you won't let me alone.
"The explanation
you've given me so far was simply raving."
"Meanwhile you are driving
at my giving Lebyadkin fifteen hundred roubles, so as to give Fedka an
opportunity to murder him."
"I know that you think I want my wife murdered
too."
"You think to tie my hands by this crime, and have me in your power."
"That's it, isn't it?"
What good will that be to you?
"What the devil do
you want with me?"
Look at me.
"Once for all, am I the man for you?"
"And
let me alone."""
"""Has Fedka been to you himself?"""
Verhovensky asked breathlessly.
"""Yes, he came."
His price is fifteen hundred too....
"But here; he'll
repeat it himself."
"There he stands."""
Stavrogin stretched out his hand.
Pyotr Stepanovitch turned round quickly.
"A new figure, Fedka, wearing a
sheep-skin coat, but without a cap, as though he were at home, stepped
out of the darkness in the doorway."
"He stood there laughing and showing
his even white teeth."
"His black eyes, with yellow whites, darted
cautiously about the room watching the gentlemen."
"There was something he
did not understand."
"He had evidently been just brought in by Kirillov,
and his inquiring eyes turned to the latter."
"He stood in the doorway,
but was unwilling to come into the room."
"""I suppose you got him ready here to listen to our bargaining, or
that he may actually see the money in our hands."
"Is that it?"""
"asked
Stavrogin; and without waiting for an answer he walked out of the house."
"Verhovensky, almost frantic, overtook him at the gate."
"""Stop!"
"Not another step!"""
"he cried, seizing him by the arm."
"Stavrogin
tried to pull away his arm, but did not succeed."
"He was overcome with
fury."
"Seizing Verhovensky by the hair with his left hand he flung him
with all his might on the ground and went out at the gate."
"But he had
not gone thirty paces before Verhovensky overtook him again."
"""Let us make it up; let us make it up!"""
"he murmured in a spasmodic
whisper."
"Stavrogin shrugged his shoulders, but neither answered nor turned round."
"""Listen."
I will bring you Lizaveta Nikolaevna to-morrow; shall I?
No?
Why don't you answer?
Tell me what you want.
I'll do it.
Listen.
"I'll
let you have Shatov."
"Shall I?"""
"""Then it's true that you meant to kill him?"""
cried Stavrogin.
"""What do you want with Shatov?"
"What is he to you?"""
"Pyotr Stepanovitch
went on, gasping, speaking rapidly."
"He was in a frenzy, and kept running
forward and seizing Stavrogin by the elbow, probably unaware of what he
was doing."
"""Listen."
I'll let you have him.
Let's make it up.
"Your price
is a very great one, but... Let's make it up!"""
"Stavrogin glanced at him at last, and was amazed."
"The eyes, the voice,
were not the same as always, or as they had been in the room just now."
What he saw was almost another face.
"The intonation of the voice was
different."
"Verhovensky besought, implored."
"He was a man from whom what
was most precious was being taken or had been taken, and who was still
stunned by the shock."
"""But what's the matter with you?"""
cried Stavrogin.
"The other did not
answer, but ran after him and gazed at him with the same imploring but
yet inflexible expression."
"""Let's make it up!"""
he whispered once more.
"""Listen."
"Like Fedka, I have
a knife in my boot, but I'll make it up with you!"""
"""But what do you want with me, damn you?"""
"Stavrogin cried, with intense
anger and amazement."
"""Is there some mystery about it?"
"Am I a sort of
talisman for you?"""
"""Listen."
"We are going to make a revolution,"" the other muttered rapidly,
and almost in delirium."
"""You don't believe we shall make a revolution?"
"We are going to make such an upheaval that everything will be uprooted
from its foundation."
"Karmazinov is right that there is nothing to lay
hold of."
Karmazinov is very intelligent.
"Another ten such groups in
different parts of Russia--and I am safe."""
"""Groups of fools like that?"""
broke reluctantly from Stavrogin.
"""Oh, don't be so clever, Stavrogin; don't be so clever yourself."
"And you
know you are by no means so intelligent that you need wish others to
be."
"You are afraid, you have no faith."
"You are frightened at our doing
things on such a scale."
And why are they fools?
They are not such fools.
No one has a mind of his own nowadays.
"There are terribly few original
minds nowadays."
"Virginsky is a pure-hearted man, ten times as pure as
you or I; but never mind about him."
"Liputin is a rogue, but I know one
point about him."
"Every rogue has some point in him.... Lyamshin is the
only one who hasn't, but he is in my hands."
"A few more groups, and I
should have money and passports everywhere; so much at least."
"Suppose it
were only that?"
"And safe places, so that they can search as they like."
They might uproot one group but they'd stick at the next.
"We'll set
things in a ferment...."
"Surely you don't think that we two are not
enough?"""
"""Take Shigalov, and let me alone....""

""Shigalov is a man of genius!"
"Do you know he is a genius like Fourier,
but bolder than Fourier; stronger."
I'll look after him.
"He's discovered
'equality'!"""
"""He is in a fever; he is raving; something very queer has happened
to him,"" thought Stavrogin, looking at him once more."
"Both walked on
without stopping."
"""He's written a good thing in that manuscript,"" Verhovensky went on."
"""He
suggests a system of spying."
"Every member of the society spies on the
others, and it's his duty to inform against them."
"Every one belongs to
all and all to every one."
All are slaves and equal in their slavery.
"In
extreme cases he advocates slander and murder, but the great thing about
it is equality."
"To begin with, the level of education, science, and
talents is lowered."
"A high level of education and science is only
possible for great intellects, and they are not wanted."
"The great
intellects have always seized the power and been despots."
"Great
intellects cannot help being despots and they've always done more harm
than good."
They will be banished or put to death.
"Cicero will have his
tongue cut out, Copernicus will have his eyes put out, Shakespeare will
be stoned--that's Shigalovism."
Slaves are bound to be equal.
"There has
never been either freedom or equality without despotism, but in the herd
there is bound to be equality, and that's Shigalovism!"
Ha ha ha!
"Do you
think it strange?"
"I am for Shigalovism."""
"Stavrogin tried to quicken his pace, and to reach home as soon as
possible."
"""If this fellow is drunk, where did he manage to get drunk?"""
crossed his mind.
"""Can it be the brandy?"""
"""Listen, Stavrogin."
"To level the mountains is a fine idea, not an absurd
one."
I am for Shigalov.
Down with culture.
We've had enough science!
"Without science we have material enough to go on for a thousand years,
but one must have discipline."
"The one thing wanting in the world is
discipline."
The thirst for culture is an aristocratic thirst.
"The moment
you have family ties or love you get the desire for property."
"We will
destroy that desire; we'll make use of drunkenness, slander, spying;
we'll make use of incredible corruption; we'll stifle every genius
in its infancy."
We'll reduce all to a common denominator!
"Complete
equality!"
"'We've learned a trade, and we are honest men; we need nothing
more,' that was an answer given by English working-men recently."
"Only the necessary is necessary, that's the motto of the whole world
henceforward."
But it needs a shock.
"That's for us, the directors, to
look after."
Slaves must have directors.
"Absolute submission, absolute
loss of individuality, but once in thirty years Shigalov would let them
have a shock and they would all suddenly begin eating one another up, to
a certain point, simply as a precaution against boredom."
"Boredom is an
aristocratic sensation."
The Shigalovians will have no desires.
"Desire
and suffering are our lot, but Shigalovism is for the slaves."""
"""You exclude yourself?"""
Stavrogin broke in again.
"""You, too."
"Do you know, I have thought of giving up the world to the
Pope."
"Let him come forth, on foot, and barefoot, and show himself to the
rabble, saying, 'See what they have brought me to!'"
"and they will all
rush after him, even the troops."
"The Pope at the head, with us
round him, and below us--Shigalovism."
"All that's needed is that the
Internationale should come to an agreement with the Pope; so it will."
And the old chap will agree at once.
There's nothing else he can do.
Remember my words!
Ha ha!
Is it stupid?
"Tell me, is it stupid or not?"""
"""That's enough!"""
Stavrogin muttered with vexation.
"""Enough!"
Listen.
I've given up the Pope!
Damn Shigalovism!
"Damn the
Pope!"
We must have something more everyday.
"Not Shigalovism, for
Shigalovism is a rare specimen of the jeweller's art."
"It's an ideal;
it's in the future."
"Shigalov is an artist and a fool like every
philanthropist."
"We need coarse work, and Shigalov despises coarse work."
Listen.
"The Pope shall be for the west, and you shall be for us, you
shall be for us!"""
"""Let me alone, you drunken fellow!"""
"muttered Stavrogin, and he quickened
his pace."
"""Stavrogin, you are beautiful,"" cried Pyotr Stepanovitch, almost
ecstatically."
"""Do you know that you are beautiful!"
"What's the most
precious thing about you is that you sometimes don't know it."
"Oh,
I've studied you!"
I often watch you on the sly!
"There's a lot of
simpleheartedness and naïveté about you still."
Do you know that?
"There
still is, there is!"
"You must be suffering and suffering genuinely from
that simple-heartedness."
I love beauty.
"I am a nihilist, but I love
beauty."
Are nihilists incapable of loving beauty?
"It's only idols they
dislike, but I love an idol."
You are my idol!
"You injure no one, and
every one hates you."
"You treat every one as an equal, and yet every one
is afraid of you--that's good."
Nobody would slap you on the shoulder.
You are an awful aristocrat.
"An aristocrat is irresistible when he goes
in for democracy!"
"To sacrifice life, your own or another's is nothing
to you."
You are just the man that's needed.
"It's just such a man as you
that I need."
I know no one but you.
"You are the leader, you are the sun
and I am your worm."""
He suddenly kissed his hand.
"A shiver ran down Stavrogin's spine, and he
pulled away his hand in dismay."
They stood still.
"""Madman!"""
whispered Stavrogin.
"""Perhaps I am raving; perhaps I am raving,"" Pyotr Stepanovitch assented,
speaking rapidly."
"""But I've thought of the first step!"
"Shigalov would
never have thought of it."
"There are lots of Shigalovs, but only one man,
one man in Russia has hit on the first step and knows how to take it."
And I am that man!
Why do you look at me?
"I need you, you; without you
I am nothing."
"Without you I am a fly, a bottled idea; Columbus without
America."""
Stavrogin stood still and looked intently into his wild eyes.
"""Listen."
"First of all we'll make an upheaval,"" Verhovensky went on in
desperate haste, continually clutching at Stavrogin's left sleeve."
"""I've
already told you."
We shall penetrate to the peasantry.
"Do you know that
we are tremendously powerful already?"
"Our party does not consist only of
those who commit murder and arson, fire off pistols in the traditional
fashion, or bite colonels."
They are only a hindrance.
"I don't accept
anything without discipline."
"I am a scoundrel, of course, and not a
socialist."
Ha ha!
Listen.
"I've reckoned them all up: a teacher who
laughs with children at their God and at their cradle is on our side."
"The lawyer who defends an educated murderer because he is more cultured
than his victims and could not help murdering them to get money is one
of us."
"The schoolboys who murder a peasant for the sake of sensation are
ours."
The juries who acquit every criminal are ours.
"The prosecutor who
trembles at a trial for fear he should not seem advanced enough is ours,
ours."
"Among officials and literary men we have lots, lots, and they
don't know it themselves."
"On the other hand, the docility of schoolboys
and fools has reached an extreme pitch; the schoolmasters are bitter
and bilious."
"On all sides we see vanity puffed up out of all proportion;
brutal, monstrous appetites.... Do you know how many we shall catch by
little, ready-made ideas?"
"When I left Russia, Littre's dictum that crime
is insanity was all the rage; I come back and I find that crime is
no longer insanity, but simply common sense, almost a duty; anyway,
a gallant protest."
"'How can we expect a cultured man not to commit a
murder, if he is in need of money.'"
But these are only the first fruits.
The Russian God has already been vanquished by cheap vodka.
"The peasants
are drunk, the mothers are drunk, the children are drunk, the churches
are empty, and in the peasant courts one hears, 'Two hundred lashes or
stand us a bucket of vodka.'"
"Oh, this generation has only to grow up."
"It's only a pity we can't afford to wait, or we might have let them get
a bit more tipsy!"
"Ah, what a pity there's no proletariat!"
"But there will
be, there will be; we are going that way....""

""It's a pity, too, that we've grown greater fools,"" muttered Stavrogin,
moving forward as before."
"""Listen."
"I've seen a child of six years old leading home his drunken
mother, whilst she swore at him with foul words."
"Do you suppose I am
glad of that?"
"When it's in our hands, maybe we'll mend things... if need
be, we'll drive them for forty years into the wilderness...."
"But one
or two generations of vice are essential now; monstrous, abject vice by
which a man is transformed into a loathsome, cruel, egoistic reptile."
That's what we need!
"And what's more, a little 'fresh blood' that we
may get accustomed to it."
Why are you laughing?
"I am not contradicting
myself."
"I am only contradicting the philanthropists and Shigalovism,
not myself!"
"I am a scoundrel, not a socialist."
Ha ha ha!
"I'm only sorry
there's no time."
"I promised Karmazinov to begin in May, and to make an
end by October."
Is that too soon?
Ha ha!
"Do you know what, Stavrogin?"
"Though the Russian people use foul language, there's nothing cynical
about them so far."
"Do you know the serfs had more self-respect than
Karmazinov?"
"Though they were beaten they always preserved their gods,
which is more than Karmazinov's done."""
"""Well, Verhovensky, this is the first time I've heard you talk, and I
listen with amazement,"" observed Stavrogin."
"""So you are really not a
socialist, then, but some sort of... ambitious politician?"""
"""A scoundrel, a scoundrel!"
You are wondering what I am.
"I'll tell you
what I am directly, that's what I am leading up to."
"It was not for
nothing that I kissed your hand."
"But the people must believe that we
know what we are after, while the other side do nothing but 'brandish
their cudgels and beat their own followers.'"
"Ah, if we only had more
time!"
"That's the only trouble, we have no time."
"We will proclaim
destruction.... Why is it, why is it that idea has such a fascination."
But we must have a little exercise; we must.
"We'll set fires going....
We'll set legends going."
Every scurvy 'group' will be of use.
"Out of
those very groups I'll pick you out fellows so keen they'll not shrink
from shooting, and be grateful for the honour of a job, too."
"Well, and
there will be an upheaval!"
"There's going to be such an upset as
the world has never seen before.... Russia will be overwhelmed with
darkness, the earth will weep for its old gods.... Well, then we shall
bring forward..."
"whom?"""
"""Whom?"""
"""Ivan the Tsarevitch."""
"""Who-m?"""
"""Ivan the Tsarevitch."
You!
"You!"""
Stavrogin thought a minute.
"""A pretender?"""
"he asked suddenly, looking with intense surprise at his
frantic companion."
"""Ah!"
"so that's your plan at last!"""
"""We shall say that he is 'in hiding,'"" Verhovensky said softly, in a
sort of tender whisper, as though he really were drunk indeed."
"""Do you
know the magic of that phrase, 'he is in hiding'?"
"But he will appear,
he will appear."
We'll set a legend going better than the Skoptsis'.
"He
exists, but no one has seen him."
"Oh, what a legend one can set going!"
And the great thing is it will be a new force at work!
"And we need that;
that's what they are crying for."
"What can Socialism do: it's destroyed
the old forces but hasn't brought in any new."
"But in this we have a
force, and what a force!"
Incredible.
"We only need one lever to lift up
the earth."
"Everything will rise up!"""
"""Then have you been seriously reckoning on me?"""
"Stavrogin said with a
malicious smile."
"""Why do you laugh, and so spitefully?"
Don't frighten me.
"I am like a
little child now."
I can be frightened to death by one smile like that.
Listen.
"I'll let no one see you, no one."
So it must be.
"He exists, but
no one has seen him; he is in hiding."
"And do you know, one might show
you, to one out of a hundred-thousand, for instance."
"And the rumour will
spread over all the land, 'We've seen him, we've seen him.'"
"""Ivan Filipovitch the God of Sabaoth,* has been seen, too, when he
ascended into heaven in his chariot in the sight of men."
"They saw
him with their own eyes."
And you are not an Ivan Filipovitch.
"You are
beautiful and proud as a God; you are seeking nothing for yourself,
with the halo of a victim round you, 'in hiding.'"
"The great thing is
the legend."
"You'll conquer them, you'll have only to look, and you will
conquer them."
"He is 'in hiding,' and will come forth bringing a new
truth."
"And, meanwhile, we'll pass two or three judgments as wise
as Solomon's."
"The groups, you know, the quintets--we've no need of
newspapers."
"If out of ten thousand petitions only one is granted, all
would come with petitions."
"In every parish, every peasant will know that
there is somewhere a hollow tree where petitions are to be put."
"And the
whole land will resound with the cry, 'A new just law is to come,' and
the sea will be troubled and the whole gimcrack show will fall to the
ground, and then we shall consider how to build up an edifice of stone."
For the first time!
"We are going to build it, we, and only we!"""
"* The reference is to the legend current in the sect of
     Flagellants.--Translator's note."
"""Madness,"" said Stavrogin."
"""Why, why don't you want it?"
Are you afraid?
"That's why I caught at you,
because you are afraid of nothing."
Is it unreasonable?
"But you see, so
far I am Columbus without America."
"Would Columbus without America seem
reasonable?"""
Stavrogin did not speak.
"Meanwhile they had reached the house and
stopped at the entrance."
"""Listen,"" Verhovensky bent down to his ear."
"""I'll do it for you without
the money."
I'll settle Marya Timofyevna to-morrow!...
"Without the money,
and to-morrow I'll bring you Liza."
"Will you have Liza to-morrow?"""
"""Is he really mad?"""
Stavrogin wondered smiling.
"The front door was
opened."
"""Stavrogin--is America ours?"""
"said Verhovensky, seizing his hand for the
last time."
"""What for?"""
"said Nikolay Vsyevolodovitch, gravely and sternly."
"""You don't care, I knew that!"""
"cried Verhovensky in an access of furious
anger."
"""You are lying, you miserable, profligate, perverted, little
aristocrat!"
"I don't believe you, you've the appetite of a wolf!..."
"Understand that you've cost me such a price, I can't give you up now!"
There's no one on earth but you!
"I invented you abroad; I invented it
all, looking at you."
"If I hadn't watched you from my corner, nothing of
all this would have entered my head!"""
Stavrogin went up the steps without answering.
"""Stavrogin!"""
"Verhovensky called after him, ""I give you a day... two,
then... three, then; more than three I can't--and then you're to
answer!"""
CHAPTER IX.
"A RAID AT STEPAN TROFIMOVITCH'S


Meanwhile an incident had occurred which astounded me and shattered
Stepan Trofimovitch."
"At eight o'clock in the morning Nastasya ran round
to me from him with the news that her master was ""raided."""
"At first I
could not make out what she meant; I could only gather that the ""raid""
was carried out by officials, that they had come and taken his papers,
and that a soldier had tied them up in a bundle and ""wheeled them away
in a barrow."""
It was a fantastic story.
"I hurried at once to Stepan
Trofimovitch."
"I found him in a surprising condition: upset and in great agitation, but
at the same time unmistakably triumphant."
"On the table in the middle of
the room the samovar was boiling, and there was a glass of tea poured
out but untouched and forgotten."
"Stepan Trofimovitch was wandering round
the table and peeping into every corner of the room, unconscious of what
he was doing."
"He was wearing his usual red knitted jacket, but seeing
me, he hurriedly put on his coat and waistcoat--a thing he had never
done before when any of his intimate friends found him in his jacket."
"He
took me warmly by the hand at once."
"_""Enfin un ami!"
"""_ (He heaved a deep sigh.)"
"""_Cher,_ I've sent to you only,
and no one knows anything."
"We must give Nastasya orders to lock the
doors and not admit anyone, except, of course them.... _Vous comprenez?_""

He looked at me uneasily, as though expecting a reply."
"I made haste, of
course, to question him, and from his disconnected and broken sentences,
full of unnecessary parentheses, I succeeded in learning that at seven
o'clock that morning an official of the province had 'all of a sudden'
called on him."
"""_Pardon, j'ai oublié son nom."
"Il n'est pas du pays,_ but I think he came
to the town with Lembke, _quelque chose de bête et d'Allemand dans la
physionomie."
"Il s'appelle Rosenthal._""

""Wasn't it Blum?"""
"""Yes, that was his name."
_Vous le connaissez?
"Quelque chose d'hébété et
de très content dans la figure, pourtant très sevère, roide et sérieux._
A type of the police, of the submissive subordinates, _je m'y connais._ I
was still asleep, and, would you believe it, he asked to have a look at
my books and manuscripts!"
"_Oui, je m'en souviens, il a employé ce mot._ He
did not arrest me, but only the books."
"_Il se tenait à distance,_ and when
he began to explain his visit he looked as though I... _enfin il
avait l'air de croire que je tomberai sur lui immédiatement et que je
commencerai a le battre comme plâtre."
"Tous ces gens du bas étage sont
comme ça_ when they have to do with a gentleman."
"I need hardly say I
understood it all at once."
"_Voilà vingt ans que je m'y prépare._ I opened
all the drawers and handed him all the keys; I gave them myself, I gave
him all."
"_J'étais digne et calme._ From the books he took the foreign
edition of Herzen, the bound volume of _The Bell,_ four copies of my poem,
_et enfin tout ça._ Then he took my letters and my papers _et quelques-unes
de mes ébauches historiques, critiques et politiques._ All that they
carried off."
"Nastasya says that a soldier wheeled them away in a barrow
and covered them with an apron; _oui, c'est cela,_ with an apron."""
"It
sounded like delirium."
Who could make head or tail of it?
"I pelted him
with questions again."
"Had Blum come alone, or with others?"
"On whose
authority?"
By what right?
How had he dared?
How did he explain it?
"""_Il etait seul, bien seul,_ but there was someone else _dans
l'antichambre, oui, je m'en souviens, et puis..._ Though I believe there
was someone else besides, and there was a guard standing in the entry."
You must ask Nastasya; she knows all about it better than I do.
"_J'étais
surexcité, voyez-vous."
"Il parlait, il parlait... un tas de chases_; he
said very little though, it was I said all that...."
"I told him the
story of my life, simply from that point of view, of course."
"_J'étais
surexcité, mais digne, je vous assure...._ I am afraid, though, I may
have shed tears."
"They got the barrow from the shop next door."""
"""Oh, heavens!"
how could all this have happened?
"But for mercy's sake,
speak more exactly, Stepan Trofimovitch."
"What you tell me sounds like a
dream."""
"""_Cher,_ I feel as though I were in a dream myself.... _Savez-vous!"
"Il
a prononcé le nom de Telyatnikof,_ and I believe that that man was
concealed in the entry."
"Yes, I remember, he suggested calling the
prosecutor and Dmitri Dmitritch, I believe... _qui me doit encore quinze
roubles_ I won at cards, _soit dit en passant."
"Enfin, je n'ai pas trop
compris._ But I got the better of them, and what do I care for Dmitri
Dmitritch?"
"I believe I begged him very earnestly to keep it quiet;
I begged him particularly, most particularly."
"I am afraid I demeaned
myself, in fact, _comment croyez-vous?"
"Enfin il a consenti._ Yes, I
remember, he suggested that himself--that it would be better to keep it
quiet, for he had only come 'to have a look round' _et rien de plus,_ and
nothing more, nothing more... and that if they find nothing, nothing
will happen."
"So that we ended it all _en amis, je suis tout à fait
content._""

""Why, then he suggested the usual course of proceedings in such cases
and regular guarantees, and you rejected them yourself,"" I cried with
friendly indignation."
"""Yes, it's better without the guarantees."
And why make a scandal?
"Let's
keep it _en amis_ so long as we can."
"You know, in our town, if they get to
know it... _mes ennemis, et puis, à quoi bon, le procureur, ce cochon de
notre procureur, qui deux fois m'a manqué de politesse et qu'on a rossé
à plaisir l'autre année chez cette charmante et belle Natalya Pavlovna
quand il se cacha dans son boudoir."
"Et puis, mon ami,_ don't make
objections and don't depress me, I beg you, for nothing is more
unbearable when a man is in trouble than for a hundred friends to point
out to him what a fool he has made of himself."
"Sit down though and have
some tea."
I must admit I am awfully tired....
"Hadn't I better lie down
and put vinegar on my head?"
"What do you think?"""
"""Certainly,"" I cried, ""ice even."
You are very much upset.
"You are pale
and your hands are trembling."
"Lie down, rest, and put off telling me."
"I'll sit by you and wait."""
"He hesitated, but I insisted on his lying down."
"Nastasya brought a cup
of vinegar."
I wetted a towel and laid it on his head.
"Then Nastasya
stood on a chair and began lighting a lamp before the ikon in the
corner."
"I noticed this with surprise; there had never been a lamp there
before and now suddenly it had made its appearance."
"""I arranged for that as soon as they had gone away,"" muttered Stepan
Trofimovitch, looking at me slyly."
"""_Quand on a de ces choses-là dans sa
chambre et qu'on vient vous arrêter_ it makes an impression and they are
sure to report that they have seen it....""

When she had done the lamp, Nastasya stood in the doorway, leaned her
cheek in her right hand, and began gazing at him with a lachrymose air."
"""_Eloignez-la_ on some excuse,"" he nodded to me from the sofa."
"""I can't
endure this Russian sympathy, _et puis ça m'embête._""

But she went away of herself."
"I noticed that he kept looking towards the
door and listening for sounds in the passage."
"_""Il faut être prêt, voyez-vous,""_ he said, looking at me significantly,
_""chaque moment..._ they may come and take one and, phew!--a man
disappears."""
"""Heavens!"
who'll come?
"Who will take you?"""
"""_Voyez-vous, mon cher,_ I asked straight out when he was going away, what
would they do to me now."""
"""You'd better have asked them where you'd be exiled!"""
"I cried out in the
same indignation."
"""That's just what I meant when I asked, but he went away without
answering."
"_Voyez-vous:_ as for linen, clothes, warm things especially,
that must be as they decide; if they tell me to take them--all right,
or they might send me in a soldier's overcoat."
"But I thrust thirty-five
roubles"" (he suddenly dropped his voice, looking towards the door by
which Nastasya had gone out) ""in a slit in my waistcoat pocket, here,
feel...."
"I believe they won't take the waistcoat off, and left seven
roubles in my purse to keep up appearances, as though that were all I
have."
"You see, it's in small change and the coppers are on the table,
so they won't guess that I've hidden the money, but will suppose that
that's all."
"For God knows where I may have to sleep to-night!"""
I bowed my head before such madness.
"It was obvious that a man could not
be arrested and searched in the way he was describing, and he must
have mixed things up."
"It's true it all happened in the days before our
present, more recent regulations."
"It is true, too, that according to his
own account they had offered to follow the more regular procedure, but
he ""got the better of them"" and refused.... Of course not long ago a
governor might, in extreme cases...."
"But how could this be an extreme
case?"
That's what baffled me.
"""No doubt they had a telegram from Petersburg,"" Stepan Trofimovitch said
suddenly."
"""A telegram?"
About you?
Because of the works of Herzen and your poem?
Have you taken leave of your senses?
"What is there in that to arrest you
for?"""
I was positively angry.
"He made a grimace and was evidently
mortified--not at my exclamation, but at the idea that there was no
ground for arrest."
"""Who can tell in our day what he may not be arrested for?"""
"he muttered
enigmatically."
A wild and nonsensical idea crossed my mind.
"""Stepan Trofimovitch, tell me as a friend,"" I cried, ""as a real friend,
I will not betray you: do you belong to some secret society or not?"""
"And on this, to my amazement, he was not quite certain whether he was or
was not a member of some secret society."
"""That depends, _voyez-vous._""

""How do you mean 'it depends'?"""
"""When with one's whole heart one is an adherent of progress and... who
can answer it?"
"You may suppose you don't belong, and suddenly it turns
out that you do belong to something."""
"""Now is that possible?"
"It's a case of yes or no."""
"""_Cela date de Pétersburg_ when she and I were meaning to found a magazine
there."
That's what's at the root of it.
"She gave them the slip then, and
they forgot us, but now they've remembered."
"_Cher, cher,_ don't you know
me?"""
he cried hysterically.
"""And they'll take us, put us in a cart, and
march us off to Siberia forever, or forget us in prison."""
And he suddenly broke into bitter weeping.
"His tears positively
streamed."
"He covered his face with his red silk handkerchief and sobbed,
sobbed convulsively for five minutes."
It wrung my heart.
"This was
the man who had been a prophet among us for twenty years, a leader,
a patriarch, the Kukolnik who had borne himself so loftily and
majestically before all of us, before whom we bowed down with genuine
reverence, feeling proud of doing so--and all of a sudden here he was
sobbing, sobbing like a naughty child waiting for the rod which the
teacher is fetching for him."
I felt fearfully sorry for him.
"He believed
in the reality of that ""cart"" as he believed that I was sitting by his
side, and he expected it that morning, at once, that very minute, and
all this on account of his Herzen and some poem!"
"Such complete, absolute
ignorance of everyday reality was touching and somehow repulsive."
"At last he left off crying, got up from the sofa and began walking about
the room again, continuing to talk to me, though he looked out of the
window every minute and listened to every sound in the passage."
"Our
conversation was still disconnected."
"All my assurances and attempts
to console him rebounded from him like peas from a wall."
"He scarcely
listened, but yet what he needed was that I should console him and keep
on talking with that object."
"I saw that he could not do without me now,
and would not let me go for anything."
"I remained, and we spent more than
two hours together."
"In conversation he recalled that Blum had taken with
him two manifestoes he had found."
"""Manifestoes!"""
"I said, foolishly frightened."
"""Do you mean to say
you...""

""Oh, ten were left here,"" he answered with vexation (he talked to me
at one moment in a vexed and haughty tone and at the next with dreadful
plaintiveness and humiliation), ""but I had disposed of eight already,
and Blum only found two."""
And he suddenly flushed with indignation.
"""_Vous me mettez avec ces gens-là!_ Do you suppose I could be working
with those scoundrels, those anonymous libellers, with my son Pyotr
Stepanovitch, _avec ces esprits forts de lâcheté?_ Oh, heavens!"""
"""Bah!"
haven't they mixed you up perhaps?...
"But it's nonsense, it can't
be so,"" I observed."
"_""Savez-vous,""_ broke from him suddenly, ""I feel at moments _que je ferai
là-bas quelque esclandre._ Oh, don't go away, don't leave me alone!"
"_Ma
carrière est finie aujourd'hui, je le sens._ Do you know, I might fall on
somebody there and bite him, like that lieutenant."""
"He looked at me with a strange expression--alarmed, and at the same time
anxious to alarm me."
"He certainly was getting more and more exasperated
with somebody and about something as time went on and the police-cart
did not appear; he was positively wrathful."
"Suddenly Nastasya, who
had come from the kitchen into the passage for some reason, upset a
clothes-horse there."
"Stepan Trofimovitch trembled and turned numb with
terror as he sat; but when the noise was explained, he almost shrieked
at Nastasya and, stamping, drove her back to the kitchen."
"A minute later
he said, looking at me in despair: ""I am ruined!"
"_Cher_""--he sat down
suddenly beside me and looked piteously into my face--""_cher,_ it's not
Siberia I am afraid of, I swear."
"_Oh, je vous jure!_"" (Tears positively
stood in his eyes.)"
"""It's something else I fear."""
"I saw from his expression that he wanted at last to tell me something of
great importance which he had till now refrained from telling."
"""I am afraid of disgrace,"" he whispered mysteriously."
"""What disgrace?"
On the contrary!
"Believe me, Stepan Trofimovitch, that all
this will be explained to-day and will end to your advantage....""

""Are you so sure that they will pardon me?"""
"""Pardon you?"
What!
What a word!
What have you done?
"I assure you you've
done nothing."""
"""_Qu'en savez-vous;_ all my life has been... _cher_..."
"They'll remember
everything... and if they find nothing, it will be _worse still_,"" he
added all of a sudden, unexpectedly."
"""How do you mean it will be worse?"""
"""It will be worse."""
"""I don't understand."""
"""My friend, let it be Siberia, Archangel, loss of rights--if I must
perish, let me perish!"
But...
"I am afraid of something else."""
"(Again
whispering, a scared face, mystery.)"
"""But of what?"
"Of what?"""
"""They'll flog me,"" he pronounced, looking at me with a face of despair."
"""Who'll flog you?"
What for?
"Where?"""
"I cried, feeling alarmed that he was
going out of his mind."
"""Where?"
"Why there... where 'that's' done."""
"""But where is it done?"""
"""Eh, _cher,_"" he whispered almost in my ear."
"""The floor suddenly gives
way under you, you drop half through.... Every one knows that."""
"""Legends!"""
"I cried, guessing what he meant."
"""Old tales."
"Can you have
believed them till now?"""
I laughed.
"""Tales!"
"But there must be foundation for them; flogged men tell no
tales."
"I've imagined it ten thousand times."""
"""But you, why you?"
"You've done nothing, you know."""
"""That makes it worse."
"They'll find out I've done nothing and flog me for
it."""
"""And you are sure that you'll be taken to Petersburg for that."""
"""My friend, I've told you already that I regret nothing, _ma carrière est
finie._ From that hour when she said good-bye to me at Skvoreshniki my
life has had no value for me... but disgrace, disgrace, _que dira-t-elle_
if she finds out?"""
He looked at me in despair.
And the poor fellow flushed all over.
"I
dropped my eyes too."
"""She'll find out nothing, for nothing will happen to you."
"I feel as if I
were speaking to you for the first time in my life, Stepan Trofimovitch,
you've astonished me so this morning."""
"""But, my friend, this isn't fear."
"For even if I am pardoned, even if
I am brought here and nothing is done to me--then I am undone."
"_Elle me
soupçonnera toute sa vie_--me, me, the poet, the thinker, the man whom
she has worshipped for twenty-two years!"""
"""It will never enter her head."""
"""It will,"" he whispered with profound conviction."
"""We've talked of it
several times in Petersburg, in Lent, before we came away, when we
were both afraid.... _Elle me soupçonnera toute sa vie..._ and how can
I disabuse her?"
It won't sound likely.
"And in this wretched town who'd
believe it, _c'est invraisemblable...."
"Et puis les femmes,_ she will be
pleased."
"She will be genuinely grieved like a true friend, but secretly
she will be pleased...."
"I shall give her a weapon against me for the
rest of my life."
"Oh, it's all over with me!"
"Twenty years of such perfect
happiness with her... and now!"""
He hid his face in his hands.
"""Stepan Trofimovitch, oughtn't you to let Varvara Petrovna know at once
of what has happened?"""
I suggested.
"""God preserve me!"""
"he cried, shuddering and leaping up from his
place."
"""On no account, never, after what was said at parting at
Skvoreshniki--never!"""
His eyes flashed.
"We went on sitting together another hour or more, I believe, expecting
something all the time--the idea had taken such hold of us."
"He lay down
again, even closed his eyes, and lay for twenty minutes without uttering
a word, so that I thought he was asleep or unconscious."
"Suddenly he got
up impulsively, pulled the towel off his head, jumped up from the sofa,
rushed to the looking-glass, with trembling hands tied his cravat, and
in a voice of thunder called to Nastasya, telling her to give him his
overcoat, his new hat and his stick."
"""I can bear no more,"" he said in a breaking voice."
"""I can't, I can't!"
"I
am going myself."""
"""Where?"""
"I cried, jumping up too."
"""To Lembke."
"_Cher,_ I ought, I am obliged."
It's my duty.
"I am a citizen
and a man, not a worthless chip."
"I have rights; I want my rights....
For twenty years I've not insisted on my rights."
"All my life I've
neglected them criminally... but now I'll demand them."
"He must tell me
everything--everything."
He received a telegram.
"He dare not torture me;
if so, let him arrest me, let him arrest me!"""
He stamped and vociferated almost with shrieks.
"""I approve of what you
say,"" I said, speaking as calmly as possible, on purpose, though I was
very much afraid for him."
"""Certainly it is better than sitting here in such misery, but I can't
approve of your state of mind."
"Just see what you look like and in what a
state you are going there!"
"_Il faut être digne et calme avec Lembke._ You
really might rush at someone there and bite him."""
"""I am giving myself up."
"I am walking straight into the jaws of the lion....""

""I'll go with you."""
"""I expected no less of you, I accept your sacrifice, the sacrifice of a
true friend; but only as far as the house, only as far as the house."
"You
ought not, you have no right to compromise yourself further by being my
confederate."
"_Oh, croyez-moi, je serai calme._ I feel that I am at this
moment _à la hauteur de tout ce que il y a de plus sacré...._""

""I may perhaps go into the house with you,"" I interrupted him."
"""I had a
message from their stupid committee yesterday through Vysotsky that they
reckon on me and invite me to the _fête_ to-morrow as one of the stewards
or whatever it is... one of the six young men whose duty it is to look
after the trays, wait on the ladies, take the guests to their places,
and wear a rosette of crimson and white ribbon on the left shoulder."
"I
meant to refuse, but now why shouldn't I go into the house on the
excuse of seeing Yulia Mihailovna herself about it?..."
"So we will go
in together."""
"He listened, nodding, but I think he understood nothing."
"We stood on the
threshold."
"_""Cher""_--he stretched out his arm to the lamp before the ikon--""_cher,_
I have never believed in this, but... so be it, so be it!"""
"He crossed
himself."
"_""Allons!"
"""_

""Well, that's better so,"" I thought as I went out on to the steps with
him."
"""The fresh air will do him good on the way, and we shall calm down,
turn back, and go home to bed....""

But I reckoned without my host."
"On the way an adventure occurred which
agitated Stepan Trofimovitch even more, and finally determined him to go
on... so that I should never have expected of our friend so much spirit
as he suddenly displayed that morning."
"Poor friend, kind-hearted friend!"
CHAPTER X. FILIBUSTERS.
"A FATAL MORNING


I

The adventure that befell us on the way was also a surprising one."
"But I
must tell the story in due order."
"An hour before Stepan Trofimovitch
and I came out into the street, a crowd of people, the hands from
Shpigulins' factory, seventy or more in number, had been marching
through the town, and had been an object of curiosity to many
spectators."
"They walked intentionally in good order and almost in
silence."
"Afterwards it was asserted that these seventy had been elected
out of the whole number of factory hands, amounting to about nine
hundred, to go to the governor and to try and get from him, in the
absence of their employer, a just settlement of their grievances against
the manager, who, in closing the factory and dismissing the workmen, had
cheated them all in an impudent way--a fact which has since been proved
conclusively."
"Some people still deny that there was any election of
delegates, maintaining that seventy was too large a number to elect,
and that the crowd simply consisted of those who had been most unfairly
treated, and that they only came to ask for help in their own case, so
that the general ""mutiny"" of the factory workers, about which there
was such an uproar later on, had never existed at all."
"Others fiercely
maintained that these seventy men were not simple strikers but
revolutionists, that is, not merely that they were the most turbulent,
but that they must have been worked upon by seditious manifestoes."
"The fact is, it is still uncertain whether there had been any outside
influence or incitement at work or not."
"My private opinion is that the
workmen had not read the seditious manifestoes at all, and if they had
read them, would not have understood one word, for one reason because
the authors of such literature write very obscurely in spite of the
boldness of their style."
"But as the workmen really were in a difficult
plight and the police to whom they appealed would not enter into their
grievances, what could be more natural than their idea of going in a
body to ""the general himself"" if possible, with the petition at their
head, forming up in an orderly way before his door, and as soon as he
showed himself, all falling on their knees and crying out to him as to
providence itself?"
"To my mind there is no need to see in this a mutiny
or even a deputation, for it's a traditional, historical mode of
action; the Russian people have always loved to parley with ""the general
himself"" for the mere satisfaction of doing so, regardless of how the
conversation may end."
"And so I am quite convinced that, even though Pyotr Stepanovitch,
Liputin, and perhaps some others--perhaps even Fedka too--had been
flitting about among the workpeople talking to them (and there is fairly
good evidence of this), they had only approached two, three, five at the
most, trying to sound them, and nothing had come of their conversation."
"As for the mutiny they advocated, if the factory-workers did understand
anything of their propaganda, they would have left off listening to it
at once as to something stupid that had nothing to do with them."
"Fedka
was a different matter: he had more success, I believe, than Pyotr
Stepanovitch."
"Two workmen are now known for a fact to have assisted
Fedka in causing the fire in the town which occurred three days
afterwards, and a month later three men who had worked in the factory
were arrested for robbery and arson in the province."
"But if in these
cases Fedka did lure them to direct and immediate action, he could only
have succeeded with these five, for we heard of nothing of the sort
being done by others."
"Be that as it may, the whole crowd of workpeople had at last reached the
open space in front of the governor's house and were drawn up there in
silence and good order."
"Then, gaping open-mouthed at the front door,
they waited."
"I am told that as soon as they halted they took off their
caps, that is, a good half-hour before the appearance of the governor,
who, as ill-luck would have it, was not at home at the moment."
"The
police made their appearance at once, at first individual policemen and
then as large a contingent of them as could be gathered together; they
began, of course, by being menacing, ordering them to break up."
"But
the workmen remained obstinately, like a flock of sheep at a fence, and
replied laconically that they had come to see ""the general himself""; it
was evident that they were firmly determined."
"The unnatural shouting
of the police ceased, and was quickly succeeded by deliberations,
mysterious whispered instructions, and stern, fussy perplexity, which
wrinkled the brows of the police officers."
"The head of the police
preferred to await the arrival of the ""governor himself."""
"It was not
true that he galloped to the spot with three horses at full speed, and
began hitting out right and left before he alighted from his carriage."
"It's true that he used to dash about and was fond of dashing about at
full speed in a carriage with a yellow back, and while his trace-horses,
who were so trained to carry their heads that they looked ""positively
perverted,"" galloped more and more frantically, rousing the enthusiasm
of all the shopkeepers in the bazaar, he would rise up in the carriage,
stand erect, holding on by a strap which had been fixed on purpose at
the side, and with his right arm extended into space like a figure on a
monument, survey the town majestically."
"But in the present case he did
not use his fists, and though as he got out of the carriage he could not
refrain from a forcible expression, this was simply done to keep up
his popularity."
"There is a still more absurd story that soldiers were
brought up with bayonets, and that a telegram was sent for artillery and
Cossacks; those are legends which are not believed now even by those
who invented them."
"It's an absurd story, too, that barrels of water were
brought from the fire brigade, and that people were drenched with water
from them."
"The simple fact is that Ilya Ilyitch shouted in his heat that
he wouldn't let one of them come dry out of the water; probably this was
the foundation of the barrel legend which got into the columns of the
Petersburg and Moscow newspapers."
"Probably the most accurate version was
that at first all the available police formed a cordon round the crowd,
and a messenger was sent for Lembke, a police superintendent, who dashed
off in the carriage belonging to the head of the police on the way to
Skvoreshniki, knowing that Lembke had gone there in his carriage half an
hour before."
"But I must confess that I am still unable to answer the question how
they could at first sight, from the first moment, have transformed an
insignificant, that is to say an ordinary, crowd of petitioners, even
though there were several of them, into a rebellion which threatened to
shake the foundations of the state."
"Why did Lembke himself rush at that
idea when he arrived twenty minutes after the messenger?"
"I imagine (but
again it's only my private opinion) that it was to the interest of Ilya
Ilyitch, who was a crony of the factory manager's, to represent the
crowd in this light to Lembke, in order to prevent him from going into
the case; and Lembke himself had put the idea into his head."
"In the
course of the last two days, he had had two unusual and mysterious
conversations with him."
"It is true they were exceedingly obscure,
but Ilya Ilyitch was able to gather from them that the governor had
thoroughly made up his mind that there were political manifestoes, and
that Shpigulins' factory hands were being incited to a Socialist rising,
and that he was so persuaded of it that he would perhaps have regretted
it if the story had turned out to be nonsense."
"""He wants to get
distinction in Petersburg,"" our wily Ilya Ilyitch thought to himself as
he left Von Lembke; ""well, that just suits me."""
"But I am convinced that poor Andrey Antonovitch would not have desired
a rebellion even for the sake of distinguishing himself."
"He was a most
conscientious official, who had lived in a state of innocence up to the
time of his marriage."
"And was it his fault that, instead of an innocent
allowance of wood from the government and an equally innocent Minnchen,
a princess of forty summers had raised him to her level?"
"I know almost
for certain that the unmistakable symptoms of the mental condition
which brought poor Andrey Antonovitch to a well-known establishment in
Switzerland, where, I am told, he is now regaining his energies,
were first apparent on that fatal morning."
"But once we admit that
unmistakable signs of something were visible that morning, it may well
be allowed that similar symptoms may have been evident the day before,
though not so clearly."
"I happen to know from the most private sources
(well, you may assume that Yulia Mihailovna later on, not in triumph
but _almost_ in remorse--for a woman is incapable of _complete_
remorse--revealed part of it to me herself) that Andrey Antonovitch had
gone into his wife's room in the middle of the previous night, past
two o'clock in the morning, had waked her up, and had insisted on her
listening to his ""ultimatum."""
"He demanded it so insistently that she
was obliged to get up from her bed in indignation and curl-papers,
and, sitting down on a couch, she had to listen, though with sarcastic
disdain."
"Only then she grasped for the first time how far gone her
Andrey Antonovitch was, and was secretly horrified."
"She ought to have
thought what she was about and have been softened, but she concealed her
horror and was more obstinate than ever."
"Like every wife she had her
own method of treating Andrey Antonovitch, which she had tried more than
once already and with it driven him to frenzy."
"Yulia Mihailovna's method
was that of contemptuous silence, for one hour, two, a whole day and
almost for three days and nights--silence whatever happened, whatever he
said, whatever he did, even if he had clambered up to throw himself
out of a three-story window--a method unendurable for a sensitive man!"
"Whether Yulia Mihailovna meant to punish her husband for his blunders of
the last few days and the jealous envy he, as the chief authority in the
town, felt for her administrative abilities; whether she was indignant
at his criticism of her behaviour with the young people and local
society generally, and lack of comprehension of her subtle and
far-sighted political aims; or was angry with his stupid and senseless
jealousy of Pyotr Stepanovitch--however that may have been, she made
up her mind not to be softened even now, in spite of its being three
o'clock at night, and though Andrey Antonovitch was in a state of
emotion such as she had never seen him in before."
"Pacing up and down in all directions over the rugs of her boudoir,
beside himself, he poured out everything, everything, quite
disconnectedly, it's true, but everything that had been rankling in
his heart, for--""it was outrageous."""
"He began by saying that he was a
laughing-stock to every one and ""was being led by the nose."""
"""Curse the expression,"" he squealed, at once catching her smile, ""let it
stand, it's true.... No, madam, the time has come; let me tell you it's
not a time for laughter and feminine arts now."
"We are not in the boudoir
of a mincing lady, but like two abstract creatures in a balloon who have
met to speak the truth."""
"(He was no doubt confused and could not find
the right words for his ideas, however just they were.)"
"""It is you,
madam, you who have destroyed my happy past."
"I took up this post
simply for your sake, for the sake of your ambition.... You smile
sarcastically?"
"Don't triumph, don't be in a hurry."
"Let me tell you,
madam, let me tell you that I should have been equal to this position,
and not only this position but a dozen positions like it, for I have
abilities; but with you, madam, with you--it's impossible, for with
you here I have no abilities."
"There cannot be two centres, and you have
created two--one of mine and one in your boudoir--two centres of power,
madam, but I won't allow it, I won't allow it!"
"In the service, as in
marriage, there must be one centre, two are impossible.... How have you
repaid me?"""
he went on.
"""Our marriage has been nothing but your proving
to me all the time, every hour, that I am a nonentity, a fool, and
even a rascal, and I have been all the time, every hour, forced in a
degrading way to prove to you that I am not a nonentity, not a fool at
all, and that I impress every one with my honourable character."
"Isn't
that degrading for both sides?"""
"At this point he began rapidly stamping with both feet on the carpet,
so that Yulia Mihailovna was obliged to get up with stern dignity."
"He
subsided quickly, but passed to being pathetic and began sobbing (yes,
sobbing!"
"), beating himself on the breast almost for five minutes,
getting more and more frantic at Yulia Mihailovna's profound silence."
"At
last he made a fatal blunder, and let slip that he was jealous of Pyotr
Stepanovitch."
"Realising that he had made an utter fool of himself, he
became savagely furious, and shouted that he ""would not allow them to
deny God"" and that he would ""send her _salon_ of irresponsible infidels
packing,"" that the governor of a province was bound to believe in God
""and so his wife was too,"" that he wouldn't put up with these young
men; that ""you, madam, for the sake of your own dignity, ought to have
thought of your husband and to have stood up for his intelligence even
if he were a man of poor abilities (and I'm by no means a man of poor
abilities!"
"), and yet it's your doing that every one here despises me, it
was you put them all up to it!"""
"He shouted that he would annihilate
the woman question, that he would eradicate every trace of it, that
to-morrow he would forbid and break up their silly fête for the benefit
of the governesses (damn them!"
"), that the first governess he came across
to-morrow morning he would drive out of the province ""with a Cossack!"
"I'll make a point of it!"""
he shrieked.
"""Do you know,"" he screamed, ""do
you know that your rascals are inciting men at the factory, and that I
know it?"
"Let me tell you, I know the names of four of these rascals and
that I am going out of my mind, hopelessly, hopelessly!..."""
"But at this point Yulia Mihailovna suddenly broke her silence and
sternly announced that she had long been aware of these criminal
designs, and that it was all foolishness, and that he had taken it too
seriously, and that as for these mischievous fellows, she knew not only
those four but all of them (it was a lie); but that she had not the
faintest intention of going out of her mind on account of it, but, on
the contrary, had all the more confidence in her intelligence and hoped
to bring it all to a harmonious conclusion: to encourage the young
people, to bring them to reason, to show them suddenly and unexpectedly
that their designs were known, and then to point out to them new aims
for rational and more noble activity."
"Oh, how can I describe the effect of this on Andrey Antonovitch!"
"Hearing
that Pyotr Stepanovitch had duped him again and had made a fool of him
so coarsely, that he had told her much more than he had told him, and
sooner than him, and that perhaps Pyotr Stepanovitch was the chief
instigator of all these criminal designs--he flew into a frenzy."
"""Senseless but malignant woman,"" he cried, snapping his bonds at one
blow, ""let me tell you, I shall arrest your worthless lover at once, I
shall put him in fetters and send him to the fortress, or--I shall jump
out of a window before your eyes this minute!"""
"Yulia Mihailovna, turning green with anger, greeted this tirade at once
with a burst of prolonged, ringing laughter, going off into peals such
as one hears at the French theatre when a Parisian actress, imported for
a fee of a hundred thousand to play a coquette, laughs in her husband's
face for daring to be jealous of her."
"Von Lembke rushed to the window, but suddenly stopped as though rooted
to the spot, folded his arms across his chest, and, white as a corpse,
looked with a sinister gaze at the laughing lady."
"""Do you know, Yulia,
do you know,"" he said in a gasping and suppliant voice, ""do you know
that even I can do something?"""
"But at the renewed and even louder
laughter that followed his last words he clenched his teeth, groaned,
and suddenly rushed, not towards the window, but at his spouse, with his
fist raised!"
"He did not bring it down--no, I repeat again and again, no;
but it was the last straw."
"He ran to his own room, not knowing what he
was doing, flung himself, dressed as he was, face downwards on his bed,
wrapped himself convulsively, head and all, in the sheet, and lay so for
two hours--incapable of sleep, incapable of thought, with a load on his
heart and blank, immovable despair in his soul."
"Now and then he shivered
all over with an agonising, feverish tremor."
"Disconnected and irrelevant
things kept coming into his mind: at one minute he thought of the old
clock which used to hang on his wall fifteen years ago in Petersburg and
had lost the minute-hand; at another of the cheerful clerk, Millebois,
and how they had once caught a sparrow together in Alexandrovsky
Park and had laughed so that they could be heard all over the park,
remembering that one of them was already a college assessor."
"I imagine
that about seven in the morning he must have fallen asleep without being
aware of it himself, and must have slept with enjoyment, with agreeable
dreams."
"Waking about ten o'clock, he jumped wildly out of bed remembered
everything at once, and slapped himself on the head; he refused his
breakfast, and would see neither Blum nor the chief of the police nor
the clerk who came to remind him that he was expected to preside over
a meeting that morning; he would listen to nothing, and did not want to
understand."
"He ran like one possessed to Yulia Mihailovna's part of the
house."
"There Sofya Antropovna, an old lady of good family who had lived
for years with Yulia Mihailovna, explained to him that his wife had set
off at ten o'clock that morning with a large company in three carriages
to Varvara Petrovna Stavrogin's, to Skvoreshniki, to look over the place
with a view to the second fête which was planned for a fortnight later,
and that the visit to-day had been arranged with Varvara Petrovna three
days before."
"Overwhelmed with this news, Andrey Antonovitch returned to
his study and impulsively ordered the horses."
"He could hardly wait for
them to be got ready."
"His soul was hungering for Yulia Mihailovna--to
look at her, to be near her for five minutes; perhaps she would glance
at him, notice him, would smile as before, forgive him... ""O-oh!"
"Aren't
the horses ready?"""
"Mechanically he opened a thick book lying on the
table."
"(He sometimes used to try his fortune in this way with a book,
opening it at random and reading the three lines at the top of the
right-hand page.)"
"What turned up was: _""Tout est pour le mieux dans
le meilleur des mondes possibles."
"""_--Voltaire, _Candide._ He uttered
an ejaculation of contempt and ran to get into the carriage."
"""Skvoreshniki!"""
"The coachman said afterwards that his master urged him on all the way,
but as soon as they were getting near the mansion he suddenly told him
to turn and drive back to the town, bidding him ""Drive fast; please
drive fast!"""
"Before they reached the town wall ""master told me to stop
again, got out of the carriage, and went across the road into the field;
I thought he felt ill but he stopped and began looking at the flowers,
and so he stood for a time."
"It was strange, really; I began to feel
quite uneasy."""
This was the coachman's testimony.
"I remember the weather
that morning: it was a cold, clear, but windy September day; before
Andrey Antonovitch stretched a forbidding landscape of bare fields from
which the crop had long been harvested; there were a few dying yellow
flowers, pitiful relics blown about by the howling wind."
"Did he want to
compare himself and his fate with those wretched flowers battered by the
autumn and the frost?"
"I don't think so; in fact I feel sure it was
not so, and that he realised nothing about the flowers in spite of the
evidence of the coachman and of the police superintendent, who drove up
at that moment and asserted afterwards that he found the governor with
a bunch of yellow flowers in his hand."
"This police superintendent,
Flibusterov by name, was an ardent champion of authority who had only
recently come to our town but had already distinguished himself and
become famous by his inordinate zeal, by a certain vehemence in the
execution of his duties, and his inveterate inebriety."
"Jumping out of
the carriage, and not the least disconcerted at the sight of what the
governor was doing, he blurted out all in one breath, with a frantic
expression, yet with an air of conviction, that ""There's an upset in the
town."""
"""Eh?"
"What?"""
"said Andrey Antonovitch, turning to him with a stern face,
but without a trace of surprise or any recollection of his carriage and
his coachman, as though he had been in his own study."
"""Police-superintendent Flibusterov, your Excellency."
"There's a riot in
the town."""
"""Filibusters?"""
Andrey Antonovitch said thoughtfully.
"""Just so, your Excellency."
"The Shpigulin men are making a riot."""
"""The Shpigulin men!..."""
"The name ""Shpigulin"" seemed to remind him of something."
"He started and
put his finger to his forehead: ""The Shpigulin men!"""
"In silence, and
still plunged in thought, he walked without haste to the carriage,
took his seat, and told the coachman to drive to the town."
"The
police-superintendent followed in the droshky."
"I imagine that he had vague impressions of many interesting things of
all sorts on the way, but I doubt whether he had any definite idea or
any settled intention as he drove into the open space in front of his
house."
"But no sooner did he see the resolute and orderly ranks of ""the
rioters,"" the cordon of police, the helpless (and perhaps purposely
helpless) chief of police, and the general expectation of which he was
the object, than all the blood rushed to his heart."
"With a pale face he
stepped out of his carriage."
"""Caps off!"""
he said breathlessly and hardly audibly.
"""On your knees!"""
"he squealed, to the surprise of every one, to his own surprise too, and
perhaps the very unexpectedness of the position was the explanation of
what followed."
"Can a sledge on a switchback at carnival stop short as it
flies down the hill?"
"What made it worse, Andrey Antonovitch had been all
his life serene in character, and never shouted or stamped at anyone;
and such people are always the most dangerous if it once happens that
something sets their sledge sliding downhill."
"Everything was whirling
before his eyes."
"""Filibusters!"""
"he yelled still more shrilly and absurdly, and his voice
broke."
"He stood, not knowing what he was going to do, but knowing
and feeling in his whole being that he certainly would do something
directly."
"""Lord!"""
was heard from the crowd.
"A lad began crossing himself; three or
four men actually did try to kneel down, but the whole mass moved three
steps forward, and suddenly all began talking at once: ""Your
Excellency... we were hired for a term... the manager... you mustn't
say,"" and so on and so on."
It was impossible to distinguish anything.
Alas!
"Andrey Antonovitch could distinguish nothing: the flowers were
still in his hands."
"The riot was as real to him as the prison carts
were to Stepan Trofimovitch."
"And flitting to and fro in the crowd
of ""rioters"" who gazed open-eyed at him, he seemed to see Pyotr
Stepanovitch, who had egged them on--Pyotr Stepanovitch, whom he hated
and whose image had never left him since yesterday."
"""Rods!"""
he cried even more unexpectedly.
A dead silence followed.
"From the facts I have learnt and those I have conjectured, this must
have been what happened at the beginning; but I have no such exact
information for what followed, nor can I conjecture it so easily."
"There
are some facts, however."
"In the first place, rods were brought on the scene with strange
rapidity; they had evidently been got ready beforehand in expectation
by the intelligent chief of the police."
"Not more than two, or at most
three, were actually flogged, however; that fact I wish to lay stress
on."
"It's an absolute fabrication to say that the whole crowd of rioters,
or at least half of them, were punished."
"It is a nonsensical story,
too, that a poor but respectable lady was caught as she passed by
and promptly thrashed; yet I read myself an account of this incident
afterwards among the provincial items of a Petersburg newspaper."
"Many
people in the town talked of an old woman called Avdotya Petrovna
Tarapygin who lived in the almshouse by the cemetery."
"She was said,
on her way home from visiting a friend, to have forced her way into the
crowd of spectators through natural curiosity."
"Seeing what was going on,
she cried out, ""What a shame!"""
and spat on the ground.
"For this it was
said she had been seized and flogged too."
"This story not only appeared
in print, but in our excitement we positively got up a subscription for
her benefit."
I subscribed twenty kopecks myself.
"And would you believe
it?"
"It appears now that there was no old woman called Tarapygin living
in the almshouse at all!"
"I went to inquire at the almshouse by the
cemetery myself; they had never heard of anyone called Tarapygin there,
and, what's more, they were quite offended when I told them the story
that was going round."
"I mention this fabulous Avdotya Petrovna because
what happened to her (if she really had existed) very nearly happened
to Stepan Trofimovitch."
"Possibly, indeed, his adventure may have been at
the bottom of the ridiculous tale about the old woman, that is, as the
gossip went on growing he was transformed into this old dame."
"What I find most difficult to understand is how he came to slip away
from me as soon as he got into the square."
"As I had a misgiving of
something very unpleasant, I wanted to take him round the square
straight to the entrance to the governor's, but my own curiosity was
roused, and I stopped only for one minute to question the first person
I came across, and suddenly I looked round and found Stepan Trofimovitch
no longer at my side."
"Instinctively I darted off to look for him in the
most dangerous place; something made me feel that his sledge, too, was
flying downhill."
"And I did, as a fact, find him in the very centre of
things."
"I remember I seized him by the arm; but he looked quietly and
proudly at me with an air of immense authority."
"_""Cher,""_ he pronounced in a voice which quivered on a breaking note, ""if
they are dealing with people so unceremoniously before us, in an open
square, what is to be expected from that man, for instance... if he
happens to act on his own authority?"""
"And shaking with indignation and with an intense desire to defy them, he
pointed a menacing, accusing finger at Flibusterov, who was gazing at us
open-eyed two paces away."
"""That man!"""
"cried the latter, blind with rage."
"""What man?"
"And who are
you?"""
"He stepped up to him, clenching his fist."
"""Who are you?"""
"he roared
ferociously, hysterically, and desperately."
"(I must mention that he
knew Stepan Trofimovitch perfectly well by sight.)"
"Another moment and he
would have certainly seized him by the collar; but luckily, hearing him
shout, Lembke turned his head."
"He gazed intensely but with perplexity
at Stepan Trofimovitch, seeming to consider something, and suddenly
he shook his hand impatiently."
Flibusterov was checked.
"I drew Stepan
Trofimovitch out of the crowd, though perhaps he may have wished to
retreat himself."
"""Home, home,"" I insisted; ""it was certainly thanks to Lembke that we
were not beaten."""
"""Go, my friend; I am to blame for exposing you to this."
"You have
a future and a career of a sort before you, while I--_mon heure est
sonnée._""

He resolutely mounted the governor's steps."
"The hall-porter knew me; I
said that we both wanted to see Yulia Mihailovna."
We sat down in the waiting-room and waited.
"I was unwilling to leave my
friend, but I thought it unnecessary to say anything more to him."
"He had
the air of a man who had consecrated himself to certain death for the
sake of his country."
"We sat down, not side by side, but in different
corners--I nearer to the entrance, he at some distance facing me, with
his head bent in thought, leaning lightly on his stick."
"He held his
wide-brimmed hat in his left hand."
We sat like that for ten minutes.
"II

Lembke suddenly came in with rapid steps, accompanied by the chief of
police, looked absent-mindedly at us and, taking no notice of us, was
about to pass into his study on the right, but Stepan Trofimovitch stood
before him blocking his way."
"The tall figure of Stepan Trofimovitch, so
unlike other people, made an impression."
Lembke stopped.
"""Who is this?"""
"he muttered, puzzled, as if he were questioning the chief
of police, though he did not turn his head towards him, and was all the
time gazing at Stepan Trofimovitch."
"""Retired college assessor, Stepan Trofimovitch Verhovensky, your
Excellency,"" answered Stepan Trofimovitch, bowing majestically."
"His
Excellency went on staring at him with a very blank expression, however."
"""What is it?"""
"And with the curtness of a great official he turned his
ear to Stepan Trofimovitch with disdainful impatience, taking him for an
ordinary person with a written petition of some sort."
"""I was visited and my house was searched to-day by an official acting in
your Excellency's name; therefore I am desirous...""

""Name?"
"Name?"""
"Lembke asked impatiently, seeming suddenly to have an
inkling of something."
"Stepan Trofimovitch repeated his name still more
majestically."
"""A-a-ah!"
"It's... that hotbed... You have shown yourself, sir, in such a
light.... Are you a professor?"
"a professor?"""
"""I once had the honour of giving some lectures to the young men of the X
university."""
"""The young men!"""
"Lembke seemed to start, though I am ready to bet that
he grasped very little of what was going on or even, perhaps, did not
know with whom he was talking."
"""That, sir, I won't allow,"" he cried, suddenly getting terribly angry."
"""I won't allow young men!"
It's all these manifestoes?
"It's an assault
on society, sir, a piratical attack, filibustering.... What is your
request?"""
"""On the contrary, your wife requested me to read something to-morrow at
her fête."
"I've not come to make a request but to ask for my rights....""

""At the fête?"
There'll be no fête.
I won't allow your fête.
A lecture?
"A
lecture?"""
he screamed furiously.
"""I should be very glad if you would speak to me rather more politely,
your Excellency, without stamping or shouting at me as though I were a
boy."""
"""Perhaps you understand whom you are speaking to?"""
"said Lembke, turning
crimson."
"""Perfectly, your Excellency."""
"""I am protecting society while you are destroying it!..."
You...
"I
remember about you, though: you used to be a tutor in the house of
Madame Stavrogin?"""
"""Yes, I was in the position... of tutor... in the house of Madame
Stavrogin."""
"""And have been for twenty years the hotbed of all that has now
accumulated... all the fruits...."
"I believe I saw you just now in the
square."
"You'd better look out, sir, you'd better look out; your way of
thinking is well known."
You may be sure that I keep my eye on you.
"I
cannot allow your lectures, sir, I cannot."
"Don't come with such requests
to me."""
He would have passed on again.
"""I repeat that your Excellency is mistaken; it was your wife who asked
me to give, not a lecture, but a literary reading at the fête to-morrow."
But I decline to do so in any case now.
"I humbly request that you will
explain to me if possible how, why, and for what reason I was subjected
to an official search to-day?"
"Some of my books and papers, private
letters to me, were taken from me and wheeled through the town in a
barrow."""
"""Who searched you?"""
"said Lembke, starting and returning to full
consciousness of the position."
He suddenly flushed all over.
"He turned
quickly to the chief of police."
"At that moment the long, stooping, and
awkward figure of Blum appeared in the doorway."
"""Why, this official here,"" said Stepan Trofimovitch, indicating him."
"Blum
came forward with a face that admitted his responsibility but showed no
contrition."
"_""Vous ne faites que des bêtises,""_ Lembke threw at him in a tone of
vexation and anger, and suddenly he was transformed and completely
himself again."
"""Excuse me,"" he muttered, utterly disconcerted and turning absolutely
crimson, ""all this... all this was probably a mere blunder, a
misunderstanding... nothing but a misunderstanding."""
"""Your Excellency,"" observed Stepan Trofimovitch, ""once when I was young
I saw a characteristic incident."
"In the corridor of a theatre a man ran
up to another and gave him a sounding smack in the face before the whole
public."
"Perceiving at once that his victim was not the person whom he
had intended to chastise but someone quite different who only slightly
resembled him, he pronounced angrily, with the haste of one whose
moments are precious--as your Excellency did just now--'I've made
a mistake... excuse me, it was a misunderstanding, nothing but a
misunderstanding.'"
"And when the offended man remained resentful and
cried out, he observed to him, with extreme annoyance: 'Why, I tell you
it was a misunderstanding."
"What are you crying out about?'"""
"""That's... that's very amusing, of course""--Lembke gave a wry
smile--""but... but can't you see how unhappy I am myself?"""
"He almost screamed, and seemed about to hide his face in his hands."
"This unexpected and piteous exclamation, almost a sob, was almost more
than one could bear."
"It was probably the first moment since the previous
day that he had full, vivid consciousness of all that had happened--and
it was followed by complete, humiliating despair that could not be
disguised--who knows, in another minute he might have sobbed aloud."
"For the first moment Stepan Trofimovitch looked wildly at him; then he
suddenly bowed his head and in a voice pregnant with feeling pronounced:

""Your Excellency, don't trouble yourself with my petulant complaint, and
only give orders for my books and letters to be restored to me....""

He was interrupted."
"At that very instant Yulia Mihailovna returned and
entered noisily with all the party which had accompanied her."
"But at
this point I should like to tell my story in as much detail as possible."
"III

In the first place, the whole company who had filled three carriages
crowded into the waiting-room."
"There was a special entrance to Yulia
Mihailovna's apartments on the left as one entered the house; but on
this occasion they all went through the waiting-room--and I imagine just
because Stepan Trofimovitch was there, and because all that had happened
to him as well as the Shpigulin affair had reached Yulia Mihailovna's
ears as she drove into the town."
"Lyamshin, who for some misdemeanour
had not been invited to join the party and so knew all that had been
happening in the town before anyone else, brought her the news."
"With
spiteful glee he hired a wretched Cossack nag and hastened on the way
to Skvoreshniki to meet the returning cavalcade with the diverting
intelligence."
"I fancy that, in spite of her lofty determination, Yulia
Mihailovna was a little disconcerted on hearing such surprising news,
but probably only for an instant."
"The political aspect of the affair,
for instance, could not cause her uneasiness; Pyotr Stepanovitch had
impressed upon her three or four times that the Shpigulin ruffians ought
to be flogged, and Pyotr Stepanovitch certainly had for some time past
been a great authority in her eyes."
"""But... anyway, I shall make him pay
for it,"" she doubtless reflected, the ""he,"" of course, referring to
her spouse."
"I must observe in passing that on this occasion, as though
purposely, Pyotr Stepanovitch had taken no part in the expedition,
and no one had seen him all day."
"I must mention too, by the way, that
Varvara Petrovna had come back to the town with her guests (in the
same carriage with Yulia Mihailovna) in order to be present at the last
meeting of the committee which was arranging the fête for the next day."
"She too must have been interested, and perhaps even agitated, by the
news about Stepan Trofimovitch communicated by Lyamshin."
The hour of reckoning for Andrey Antonovitch followed at once.
Alas!
"he
felt that from the first glance at his admirable wife."
"With an open air
and an enchanting smile she went quickly up to Stepan Trofimovitch, held
out her exquisitely gloved hand, and greeted him with a perfect shower
of flattering phrases--as though the only thing she cared about that
morning was to make haste to be charming to Stepan Trofimovitch because
at last she saw him in her house."
"There was not one hint of the search
that morning; it was as though she knew nothing of it."
"There was not one
word to her husband, not one glance in his direction--as though he
had not been in the room."
"What's more, she promptly confiscated Stepan
Trofimovitch and carried him off to the drawing-room--as though he had
had no interview with Lembke, or as though it was not worth prolonging
if he had."
"I repeat again, I think that in this, Yulia Mihailovna,
in spite of her aristocratic tone, made another great mistake."
"And
Karmazinov particularly did much to aggravate this."
"(He had taken part
in the expedition at Yulia Mihailovna's special request, and in that way
had, incidentally, paid his visit to Varvara Petrovna, and she was so
poor-spirited as to be perfectly delighted at it.)"
"On seeing Stepan
Trofimovitch, he called out from the doorway (he came in behind the
rest) and pressed forward to embrace him, even interrupting Yulia
Mihailovna."
"""What years, what ages!"
"At last..._excellent ami._""

He made as though to kiss him, offering his cheek, of course, and Stepan
Trofimovitch was so fluttered that he could not avoid saluting it."
"_""Cher,""_ he said to me that evening, recalling all the events of that
day, ""I wondered at that moment which of us was the most contemptible:
he, embracing me only to humiliate me, or I, despising him and his face
and kissing it on the spot, though I might have turned away...."
"Foo!"""
"""Come, tell me about yourself, tell me everything,"" Karmazinov drawled
and lisped, as though it were possible for him on the spur of the moment
to give an account of twenty-five years of his life."
"But this foolish
trifling was the height of ""chic."""
"""Remember that the last time we met was at the Granovsky dinner in
Moscow, and that twenty-four years have passed since then..."" Stepan
Trofimovitch began very reasonably (and consequently not at all in the
same ""chic"" style)."
"_""Ce cher homme,""_ Karmazinov interrupted with shrill familiarity,
squeezing his shoulder with exaggerated friendliness."
"""Make haste and
take us to your room, Yulia Mihailovna; there he'll sit down and tell us
everything."""
"""And yet I was never at all intimate with that peevish old woman,""
Stepan Trofimovitch went on complaining to me that same evening, shaking
with anger; ""we were almost boys, and I'd begun to detest him even
then... just as he had me, of course."""
Yulia Mihailovna's drawing-room filled up quickly.
"Varvara Petrovna
was particularly excited, though she tried to appear indifferent, but
I caught her once or twice glancing with hatred at Karmazinov and with
wrath at Stepan Trofimovitch--the wrath of anticipation, the wrath of
jealousy and love: if Stepan Trofimovitch had blundered this time and
had let Karmazinov make him look small before every one, I believe she
would have leapt up and beaten him."
"I have forgotten to say that
Liza too was there, and I had never seen her more radiant, carelessly
light-hearted, and happy."
"Mavriky Nikolaevitch was there too, of course."
"In the crowd of young ladies and rather vulgar young men who made up
Yulia Mihailovna's usual retinue, and among whom this vulgarity was
taken for sprightliness, and cheap cynicism for wit, I noticed two or
three new faces: a very obsequious Pole who was on a visit in the town;
a German doctor, a sturdy old fellow who kept loudly laughing with great
zest at his own wit; and lastly, a very young princeling from Petersburg
like an automaton figure, with the deportment of a state dignitary and
a fearfully high collar."
"But it was evident that Yulia Mihailovna had a
very high opinion of this visitor, and was even a little anxious of the
impression her salon was making on him."
"_""Cher M. Karmazinov,""_ said Stepan Trofimovitch, sitting in a picturesque
pose on the sofa and suddenly beginning to lisp as daintily as
Karmazinov himself, ""_cher M. Karmazinov,_ the life of a man of our time
and of certain convictions, even after an interval of twenty-five years,
is bound to seem monotonous...""

The German went off into a loud abrupt guffaw like a neigh, evidently
imagining that Stepan Trofimovitch had said something exceedingly funny."
"The latter gazed at him with studied amazement but produced no effect
on him whatever."
"The prince, too, looked at the German, turning head,
collar and all, towards him and putting up his pince-nez, though without
the slightest curiosity."
"""... Is bound to seem monotonous,"" Stepan Trofimovitch intentionally
repeated, drawling each word as deliberately and nonchalantly as
possible."
"""And so my life has been throughout this quarter of a century,
_et comme on trouve partout plus de moines que de raison,_ and as I am
entirely of this opinion, it has come to pass that throughout this
quarter of a century I...""

_""C'est charmant, les moines,""_ whispered Yulia Mihailovna, turning to
Varvara Petrovna, who was sitting beside her."
Varvara Petrovna responded with a look of pride.
"But Karmazinov could
not stomach the success of the French phrase, and quickly and shrilly
interrupted Stepan Trofimovitch."
"""As for me, I am quite at rest on that score, and for the past seven
years I've been settled at Karlsruhe."
"And last year, when it was
proposed by the town council to lay down a new water-pipe, I felt in
my heart that this question of water-pipes in Karlsruhe was dearer and
closer to my heart than all the questions of my precious Fatherland...
in this period of so-called reform."""
"""I can't help sympathising, though it goes against the grain,"" sighed
Stepan Trofimovitch, bowing his head significantly."
"Yulia Mihailovna was triumphant: the conversation was becoming profound
and taking a political turn."
"""A drain-pipe?"""
the doctor inquired in a loud voice.
"""A water-pipe, doctor, a water-pipe, and I positively assisted them in
drawing up the plan."""
The doctor went off into a deafening guffaw.
"Many people followed his
example, laughing in the face of the doctor, who remained unconscious of
it and was highly delighted that every one was laughing."
"""You must allow me to differ from you, Karmazinov,"" Yulia Mihailovna
hastened to interpose."
"""Karlsruhe is all very well, but you are fond
of mystifying people, and this time we don't believe you."
"What Russian
writer has presented so many modern types, has brought forward so many
contemporary problems, has put his finger on the most vital modern
points which make up the type of the modern man of action?"
"You, only
you, and no one else."
"It's no use your assuring us of your coldness
towards your own country and your ardent interest in the water-pipes of
Karlsruhe."
"Ha ha!"""
"""Yes, no doubt,"" lisped Karmazinov."
"""I have portrayed in the character
of Pogozhev all the failings of the Slavophils and in the character of
Nikodimov all the failings of the Westerners....""

""I say, hardly _all!_"" Lyamshin whispered slyly."
"""But I do this by the way, simply to while away the tedious hours and to
satisfy the persistent demands of my fellow-countrymen."""
"""You are probably aware, Stepan Trofimovitch,"" Yulia Mihailovna went on
enthusiastically, ""that to-morrow we shall have the delight of hearing
the charming lines... one of the last of Semyon Yakovlevitch's exquisite
literary inspirations--it's called _Merci._ He announces in this piece
that he will write no more, that nothing in the world will induce him
to, if angels from Heaven or, what's more, all the best society were to
implore him to change his mind."
"In fact he is laying down the pen for
good, and this graceful _Merci_ is addressed to the public in grateful
acknowledgment of the constant enthusiasm with which it has for so many
years greeted his unswerving loyalty to true Russian thought."""
Yulia Mihailovna was at the acme of bliss.
"""Yes, I shall make my farewell; I shall say my _Merci_ and depart and
there... in Karlsruhe..."
"I shall close my eyes."""
"Karmazinov was gradually
becoming maudlin."
"Like many of our great writers (and there are numbers of them amongst
us), he could not resist praise, and began to be limp at once, in spite
of his penetrating wit."
But I consider this is pardonable.
"They say that
one of our Shakespeares positively blurted out in private conversation
that ""we _great men_ can't do otherwise,"" and so on, and, what's more, was
unaware of it."
"""There in Karlsruhe I shall close my eyes."
"When we have done our duty,
all that's left for us great men is to make haste to close our eyes
without seeking a reward."
"I shall do so too."""
"""Give me the address and I shall come to Karlsruhe to visit your tomb,""
said the German, laughing immoderately."
"""They send corpses by rail nowadays,"" one of the less important young
men said unexpectedly."
Lyamshin positively shrieked with delight.
Yulia Mihailovna frowned.
Nikolay Stavrogin walked in.
"""Why, I was told that you were locked up?"""
"he said aloud, addressing
Stepan Trofimovitch before every one else."
"""No, it was a case of unlocking,"" jested Stepan Trofimovitch."
"""But I hope that what's happened will have no influence on what I asked
you to do,"" Yulia Mihailovna put in again."
"""I trust that you will not
let this unfortunate annoyance, of which I had no idea, lead you to
disappoint our eager expectations and deprive us of the enjoyment of
hearing your reading at our literary matinée."""
"""I don't know, I... now...""

""Really, I am so unlucky, Varvara Petrovna... and only fancy, just when
I was so longing to make the personal acquaintance of one of the
most remarkable and independent intellects of Russia--and here Stepan
Trofimovitch suddenly talks of deserting us."""
"""Your compliment is uttered so audibly that I ought to pretend not to
hear it,"" Stepan Trofimovitch said neatly, ""but I cannot believe that
my insignificant presence is so indispensable at your fête to-morrow."
"However, I...""

""Why, you'll spoil him!"""
"cried Pyotr Stepanovitch, bursting into the
room."
"""I've only just got him in hand--and in one morning he has been
searched, arrested, taken by the collar by a policeman, and here ladies
are cooing to him in the governor's drawing-room."
"Every bone in his body
is aching with rapture; in his wildest dreams he had never hoped for
such good fortune."
"Now he'll begin informing against the Socialists
after this!"""
"""Impossible, Pyotr Stepanovitch!"
"Socialism is too grand an idea to
be unrecognised by Stepan Trofimovitch."""
"Yulia Mihailovna took up the
gauntlet with energy."
"""It's a great idea but its exponents are not always great men, _et
brisons-là, mon cher,_"" Stepan Trofimovitch ended, addressing his son and
rising gracefully from his seat."
But at this point an utterly unexpected circumstance occurred.
"Von
Lembke had been in the room for some time but seemed unnoticed by
anyone, though every one had seen him come in."
"In accordance with her
former plan, Yulia Mihailovna went on ignoring him."
"He took up his
position near the door and with a stern face listened gloomily to the
conversation."
"Hearing an allusion to the events of the morning, he
began fidgeting uneasily, stared at the prince, obviously struck by his
stiffly starched, prominent collar; then suddenly he seemed to start on
hearing the voice of Pyotr Stepanovitch and seeing him burst in; and no
sooner had Stepan Trofimovitch uttered his phrase about Socialists than
Lembke went up to him, pushing against Lyamshin, who at once skipped out
of the way with an affected gesture of surprise, rubbing his shoulder
and pretending that he had been terribly bruised."
"""Enough!"""
"said Von Lembke to Stepan Trofimovitch, vigorously gripping
the hand of the dismayed gentleman and squeezing it with all his might
in both of his."
"""Enough!"
The filibusters of our day are unmasked.
"Not
another word."
"Measures have been taken....""

He spoke loudly enough to be heard by all the room, and concluded with
energy."
The impression he produced was poignant.
"Everybody felt that
something was wrong."
I saw Yulia Mihailovna turn pale.
"The effect was
heightened by a trivial accident."
"After announcing that measures had
been taken, Lembke turned sharply and walked quickly towards the door,
but he had hardly taken two steps when he stumbled over a rug, swerved
forward, and almost fell."
"For a moment he stood still, looked at the rug
at which he had stumbled, and, uttering aloud ""Change it!"""
"went out of
the room."
Yulia Mihailovna ran after him.
"Her exit was followed by an
uproar, in which it was difficult to distinguish anything."
"Some said he
was ""deranged,"" others that he was ""liable to attacks""; others put their
fingers to their forehead; Lyamshin, in the corner, put his two fingers
above his forehead."
"People hinted at some domestic difficulties--in a
whisper, of course."
No one took up his hat; all were waiting.
"I don't
know what Yulia Mihailovna managed to do, but five minutes later she
came back, doing her utmost to appear composed."
"She replied evasively
that Andrey Antonovitch was rather excited, but that it meant nothing,
that he had been like that from a child, that she knew ""much better,""
and that the fête next day would certainly cheer him up."
"Then followed a
few flattering words to Stepan Trofimovitch simply from civility, and a
loud invitation to the members of the committee to open the meeting now,
at once."
"Only then, all who were not members of the committee prepared
to go home; but the painful incidents of this fatal day were not yet
over."
"I noticed at the moment when Nikolay Stavrogin came in that Liza looked
quickly and intently at him and was for a long time unable to take her
eyes off him--so much so that at last it attracted attention."
"I saw
Mavriky Nikolaevitch bend over her from behind; he seemed to mean to
whisper something to her, but evidently changed his intention and drew
himself up quickly, looking round at every one with a guilty air."
"Nikolay
Vsyevolodovitch too excited curiosity; his face was paler than usual and
there was a strangely absent-minded look in his eyes."
"After flinging
his question at Stepan Trofimovitch he seemed to forget about him
altogether, and I really believe he even forgot to speak to his hostess."
"He did not once look at Liza--not because he did not want to, but I am
certain because he did not notice her either."
"And suddenly, after the
brief silence that followed Yulia Mihailovna's invitation to open the
meeting without loss of time, Liza's musical voice, intentionally loud,
was heard."
She called to Stavrogin.
"""Nikolay Vsyevolodovitch, a captain who calls himself a relation of
yours, the brother of your wife, and whose name is Lebyadkin, keeps
writing impertinent letters to me, complaining of you and offering to
tell me some secrets about you."
"If he really is a connection of yours,
please tell him not to annoy me, and save me from this unpleasantness."""
"There was a note of desperate challenge in these words--every one
realised it."
"The accusation was unmistakable, though perhaps it was a
surprise to herself."
"She was like a man who shuts his eyes and throws
himself from the roof."
But Nikolay Stavrogin's answer was even more astounding.
"To begin with, it was strange that he was not in the least surprised and
listened to Liza with unruffled attention."
"There was no trace of either
confusion or anger in his face."
"Simply, firmly, even with an air of
perfect readiness, he answered the fatal question:

""Yes, I have the misfortune to be connected with that man."
"I have been
the husband of his sister for nearly five years."
"You may be sure I will
give him your message as soon as possible, and I'll answer for it that
he shan't annoy you again."""
"I shall never forget the horror that was reflected on the face of
Varvara Petrovna."
"With a distracted air she got up from her seat,
lifting up her right hand as though to ward off a blow."
"Nikolay
Vsyevolodovitch looked at her, looked at Liza, at the spectators, and
suddenly smiled with infinite disdain; he walked deliberately out of the
room."
"Every one saw how Liza leapt up from the sofa as soon as he
turned to go and unmistakably made a movement to run after him."
"But she
controlled herself and did not run after him; she went quietly out of
the room without saying a word or even looking at anyone, accompanied,
of course, by Mavriky Nikolaevitch, who rushed after her."
"The uproar and the gossip that night in the town I will not attempt to
describe."
"Varvara Petrovna shut herself up in her town house and Nikolay
Vsyevolodovitch, it was said, went straight to Skvoreshniki without
seeing his mother."
"Stepan Trofimovitch sent me that evening to _cette
chère amie_ to implore her to allow him to come to her, but she would not
see me."
He was terribly overwhelmed; he shed tears.
"""Such a marriage!"
Such a marriage!
"Such an awful thing in the family!"""
he kept repeating.
"He remembered Karmazinov, however, and abused him terribly."
"He set
to work vigorously to prepare for the reading too and--the artistic
temperament!--rehearsed before the looking-glass and went over all the
jokes and witticisms uttered in the course of his life which he had
written down in a separate notebook, to insert into his reading next
day."
"""My dear, I do this for the sake of a great idea,"" he said to me,
obviously justifying himself."
"""_Cher ami,_ I have been stationary for
twenty-five years and suddenly I've begun to move--whither, I know
not--but I've begun to move....""





PART III




CHAPTER I."
"THE FETE--FIRST PART


I

The fête took place in spite of all the perplexities of the preceding
""Shpigulin"" day."
"I believe that even if Lembke had died the previous
night, the fête would still have taken place next morning--so peculiar
was the significance Yulia Mihailovna attached to it."
Alas!
"up to the
last moment she was blind and had no inkling of the state of public
feeling."
"No one believed at last that the festive day would pass without
some tremendous scandal, some ""catastrophe"" as some people expressed it,
rubbing their hands in anticipation."
"Many people, it is true, tried to
assume a frowning and diplomatic countenance; but, speaking generally,
every Russian is inordinately delighted at any public scandal and
disorder."
"It is true that we did feel something much more serious
than the mere craving for a scandal: there was a general feeling
of irritation, a feeling of implacable resentment; every one seemed
thoroughly disgusted with everything."
"A kind of bewildered cynicism, a
forced, as it were, strained cynicism was predominant in every one."
"The
only people who were free from bewilderment were the ladies, and they
were clear on only one point: their remorseless detestation of Yulia
Mihailovna."
Ladies of all shades of opinion were agreed in this.
"And
she, poor dear, had no suspicion; up to the last hour she was persuaded
that she was ""surrounded by followers,"" and that they were still
""fanatically devoted to her."""
"I have already hinted that some low fellows of different sorts had
made their appearance amongst us."
"In turbulent times of upheaval or
transition low characters always come to the front everywhere."
"I am
not speaking now of the so-called ""advanced"" people who are always in a
hurry to be in advance of every one else (their absorbing anxiety) and
who always have some more or less definite, though often very stupid,
aim."
"No, I am speaking only of the riff-raff."
"In every period of
transition this riff-raff, which exists in every society, rises to the
surface, and is not only without any aim but has not even a symptom of
an idea, and merely does its utmost to give expression to uneasiness and
impatience."
"Moreover, this riff-raff almost always falls unconsciously
under the control of the little group of ""advanced people"" who do act
with a definite aim, and this little group can direct all this rabble
as it pleases, if only it does not itself consist of absolute idiots,
which, however, is sometimes the case."
"It is said among us now that it
is all over, that Pyotr Stepanovitch was directed by the _Internationale,_
and Yulia Mihailovna by Pyotr Stepanovitch, while she controlled, under
his rule, a rabble of all sorts."
"The more sober minds amongst us wonder
at themselves now, and can't understand how they came to be so foolish
at the time."
"What constituted the turbulence of our time and what transition it was
we were passing through I don't know, nor I think does anyone, unless
it were some of those visitors of ours."
"Yet the most worthless fellows
suddenly gained predominant influence, began loudly criticising
everything sacred, though till then they had not dared to open their
mouths, while the leading people, who had till then so satisfactorily
kept the upper hand, began listening to them and holding their peace,
some even simpered approval in a most shameless way."
"People like
Lyamshin and Telyatnikov, like Gogol's Tentyotnikov, drivelling
home-bred editions of Radishtchev, wretched little Jews with a mournful
but haughty smile, guffawing foreigners, poets of advanced tendencies
from the capital, poets who made up with peasant coats and tarred boots
for the lack of tendencies or talents, majors and colonels who ridiculed
the senselessness of the service, and who would have been ready for an
extra rouble to unbuckle their swords, and take jobs as railway clerks;
generals who had abandoned their duties to become lawyers; advanced
mediators, advancing merchants, innumerable divinity students, women
who were the embodiment of the woman question--all these suddenly gained
complete sway among us and over whom?"
"Over the club, the venerable
officials, over generals with wooden legs, over the very strict and
inaccessible ladies of our local society."
"Since even Varvara Petrovna
was almost at the beck and call of this rabble, right up to the time
of the catastrophe with her son, our other local Minervas may well be
pardoned for their temporary aberration."
"Now all this is attributed,
as I have mentioned already, to the _Internationale._ This idea has taken
such root that it is given as the explanation to visitors from other
parts."
"Only lately councillor Kubrikov, a man of sixty-two, with the
Stanislav Order on his breast, came forward uninvited and confessed in
a voice full of feeling that he had beyond a shadow of doubt been for
fully three months under the influence of the _Internationale._ When with
every deference for his years and services he was invited to be more
definite, he stuck firmly to his original statement, though he could
produce no evidence except that ""he had felt it in all his feelings,"" so
that they cross-examined him no further."
"I repeat again, there was still even among us a small group who held
themselves aloof from the beginning, and even locked themselves up."
"But
what lock can stand against a law of nature?"
"Daughters will grow up even
in the most careful families, and it is essential for grown-up daughters
to dance."
"And so all these people, too, ended by subscribing to the governesses'
fund."
"The ball was assumed to be an entertainment so brilliant, so
unprecedented; marvels were told about it; there were rumours of princes
from a distance with lorgnettes; of ten stewards, all young dandies,
with rosettes on their left shoulder; of some Petersburg people who
were setting the thing going; there was a rumour that Karmazinov had
consented to increase the subscriptions to the fund by reading his _Merci_
in the costume of the governesses of the district; that there would be
a literary quadrille all in costume, and every costume would symbolise
some special line of thought; and finally that ""honest Russian thought""
would dance in costume--which would certainly be a complete novelty in
itself."
Who could resist subscribing?
Every one subscribed.
"II

The programme of the fête was divided into two parts: the literary
matinée from midday till four o'clock, and afterwards a ball from ten
o'clock onwards through the night."
"But in this very programme there lay
concealed germs of disorder."
"In the first place, from the very beginning
a rumour had gained ground among the public concerning a luncheon
immediately after the literary matinée, or even while it was going
on, during an interval arranged expressly for it--a free luncheon, of
course, which would form part of the programme and be accompanied by
champagne."
"The immense price of the tickets (three roubles) tended to
confirm this rumour."
"""As though one would subscribe for nothing?"
"The
fête is arranged for twenty-four hours, so food must be provided."
"People
will get hungry."""
This was how people reasoned in the town.
"I must admit
that Yulia Mihailovna did much to confirm this disastrous rumour by her
own heedlessness."
"A month earlier, under the first spell of the great
project, she would babble about it to anyone she met; and even sent a
paragraph to one of the Petersburg papers about the toasts and speeches
arranged for her fête."
"What fascinated her most at that time was
the idea of these toasts; she wanted to propose them herself and was
continually composing them in anticipation."
"They were to make clear what
was their banner (what was it?"
"I don't mind betting that the poor dear
composed nothing after all), they were to get into the Petersburg and
Moscow papers, to touch and fascinate the higher powers and then to
spread the idea over all the provinces of Russia, rousing people to
wonder and imitation."
"But for toasts, champagne was essential, and as champagne can't be
drunk on an empty stomach, it followed that a lunch was essential too."
"Afterwards, when by her efforts a committee had been formed and had
attacked the subject more seriously, it was proved clearly to her at
once that if they were going to dream of banquets there would be very
little left for the governesses, however well people subscribed."
"There
were two ways out of the difficulty: either Belshazzar's feast with
toasts and speeches, and ninety roubles for the governesses, or a
considerable sum of money with the fête only as a matter of form to
raise it."
"The committee, however, only wanted to scare her, and had of
course worked out a third course of action, which was reasonable and
combined the advantages of both, that is, a very decent fête in every
respect only without champagne, and so yielding a very respectable sum,
much more than ninety roubles."
"But Yulia Mihailovna would not agree to
it: her proud spirit revolted from paltry compromise."
"She decided at
once that if the original idea could not be carried out they should rush
to the opposite extreme, that is, raise an enormous subscription that
would be the envy of other provinces."
"""The public must understand,""
she said at the end of her flaming speech to the committee, ""that
the attainment of an object of universal human interest is infinitely
loftier than the corporeal enjoyments of the passing moment, that the
fête in its essence is only the proclamation of a great idea, and so we
ought to be content with the most frugal German ball simply as a symbol,
that is, if we can't dispense with this detestable ball altogether,""
so great was the aversion she suddenly conceived for it."
"But she was
pacified at last."
"It was then that ""the literary quadrille"" and the
other æsthetic items were invented and proposed as substitutes for the
corporeal enjoyments."
"It was then that Karmazinov finally consented to
read _Merci_ (until then he had only tantalised them by his hesitation) and
so eradicate the very idea of victuals from the minds of our incontinent
public."
"So the ball was once more to be a magnificent function, though
in a different style."
"And not to be too ethereal it was decided that tea
with lemon and round biscuits should be served at the beginning of the
ball, and later on ""orchade"" and lemonade and at the end even ices--but
nothing else."
"For those who always and everywhere are hungry and, still
more, thirsty, they might open a buffet in the farthest of the suite of
rooms and put it in charge of Prohorovitch, the head cook of the club,
who would, subject to the strict supervision of the committee, serve
whatever was wanted, at a fixed charge, and a notice should be put up
on the door of the hall that refreshments were extra."
"But on the morning
they decided not to open the buffet at all for fear of disturbing the
reading, though the buffet would have been five rooms off the White Hall
in which Karmazinov had consented to read _Merci._

It is remarkable that the committee, and even the most practical people
in it, attached enormous consequence to this reading."
"As for people
of poetical tendencies, the marshal's wife, for instance, informed
Karmazinov that after the reading she would immediately order a marble
slab to be put up in the wall of the White Hall with an inscription
in gold letters, that on such a day and year, here, in this place, the
great writer of Russia and of Europe had read _Merci_ on laying aside his
pen, and so had for the first time taken leave of the Russian public
represented by the leading citizens of our town, and that this
inscription would be read by all at the ball, that is, only five hours
after _Merci_ had been read."
"I know for a fact that Karmazinov it was who
insisted that there should be no buffet in the morning on any account,
while he was reading, in spite of some protests from members of the
committee that this was rather opposed to our way of doing things."
"This was the position of affairs, while in the town people were still
reckoning on a Belshazzar feast, that is, on refreshments provided by
the committee; they believed in this to the last hour."
"Even the young
ladies were dreaming of masses of sweets and preserves, and something
more beyond their imagination."
"Every one knew that the subscriptions had
reached a huge sum, that all the town was struggling to go, that people
were driving in from the surrounding districts, and that there were
not tickets enough."
"It was known, too, that there had been some large
subscriptions apart from the price paid for tickets: Varvara Petrovna,
for instance, had paid three hundred roubles for her ticket and had
given almost all the flowers from her conservatory to decorate the room."
"The marshal's wife, who was a member of the committee, provided the
house and the lighting; the club furnished the music, the attendants,
and gave up Prohorovitch for the whole day."
"There were other
contributions as well, though lesser ones, so much so indeed that the
idea was mooted of cutting down the price of tickets from three roubles
to two."
"Indeed, the committee were afraid at first that three roubles
would be too much for young ladies to pay, and suggested that they might
have family tickets, so that every family should pay for one daughter
only, while the other young ladies of the family, even if there were a
dozen specimens, should be admitted free."
"But all their apprehensions
turned out to be groundless: it was just the young ladies who did come."
"Even the poorest clerks brought their girls, and it was quite evident
that if they had had no girls it would never have occurred to them to
subscribe for tickets."
"One insignificant little secretary brought all
his seven daughters, to say nothing of his wife and a niece into the
bargain, and every one of these persons held in her hand an entrance
ticket that cost three roubles."
It may be imagined what an upheaval it made in the town!
"One has only to
remember that as the fête was divided into two parts every lady needed
two costumes for the occasion--a morning one for the matinée and a
ball dress for the evening."
"Many middle-class people, as it appeared
afterwards, had pawned everything they had for that day, even the family
linen, even the sheets, and possibly the mattresses, to the Jews, who
had been settling in our town in great numbers during the previous two
years and who became more and more numerous as time went on."
"Almost all
the officials had asked for their salary in advance, and some of the
landowners sold beasts they could ill spare, and all simply to bring
their ladies got up as marchionesses, and to be as good as anybody."
"The
magnificence of dresses on this occasion was something unheard of in our
neighbourhood."
"For a fortnight beforehand the town was overflowing with
funny stories which were all brought by our wits to Yulia Mihailovna's
court."
Caricatures were passed from hand to hand.
"I have seen some
drawings of the sort myself, in Yulia Mihailovna's album."
"All this
reached the ears of the families who were the source of the jokes; I
believe this was the cause of the general hatred of Yulia Mihailovna
which had grown so strong in the town."
"People swear and gnash their
teeth when they think of it now."
"But it was evident, even at the time,
that if the committee were to displease them in anything, or if anything
went wrong at the ball, the outburst of indignation would be something
surprising."
"That's why every one was secretly expecting a scandal; and
if it was so confidently expected, how could it fail to come to pass?"
The orchestra struck up punctually at midday.
"Being one of the stewards,
that is, one of the twelve ""young men with a rosette,"" I saw with my own
eyes how this day of ignominious memory began."
"It began with an enormous
crush at the doors."
"How was it that everything, including the police,
went wrong that day?"
"I don't blame the genuine public: the fathers of
families did not crowd, nor did they push against anyone, in spite of
their position."
"On the contrary, I am told that they were disconcerted
even in the street, at the sight of the crowd shoving in a way unheard
of in our town, besieging the entry and taking it by assault, instead
of simply going in."
"Meanwhile the carriages kept driving up, and at last
blocked the street."
"Now, at the time I write, I have good grounds for
affirming that some of the lowest rabble of our town were brought in
without tickets by Lyamshin and Liputin, possibly, too, by other people
who were stewards like me."
"Anyway, some complete strangers, who had come
from the surrounding districts and elsewhere, were present."
"As soon as
these savages entered the hall they began asking where the buffet was,
as though they had been put up to it beforehand, and learning that
there was no buffet they began swearing with brutal directness, and an
unprecedented insolence; some of them, it is true, were drunk when they
came."
"Some of them were dazed like savages at the splendour of the
hall, as they had never seen anything like it, and subsided for a minute
gazing at it open-mouthed."
"This great White Hall really was magnificent,
though the building was falling into decay: it was of immense size, with
two rows of windows, with an old-fashioned ceiling covered with gilt
carving, with a gallery with mirrors on the walls, red and white
draperies, marble statues (nondescript but still statues) with heavy old
furniture of the Napoleonic period, white and gold, upholstered in red
velvet."
"At the moment I am describing, a high platform had been put
up for the literary gentlemen who were to read, and the whole hall was
filled with chairs like the parterre of a theatre with wide aisles for
the audience."
"But after the first moments of surprise the most senseless questions and
protests followed."
"""Perhaps we don't care for a reading.... We've paid
our money...."
The audience has been impudently swindled....
"This is our
entertainment, not the Lembkes!"""
"They seemed, in fact, to have been
let in for this purpose."
"I remember specially an encounter in which the
princeling with the stand-up collar and the face of a Dutch doll, whom I
had met the morning before at Yulia Mihailovna's, distinguished himself."
"He had, at her urgent request, consented to pin a rosette on his left
shoulder and to become one of our stewards."
"It turned out that this dumb
wax figure could act after a fashion of his own, if he could not talk."
"When a colossal pockmarked captain, supported by a herd of rabble
following at his heels, pestered him by asking ""which way to the
buffet?"""
he made a sign to a police sergeant.
"His hint was promptly
acted upon, and in spite of the drunken captain's abuse he was
dragged out of the hall."
"Meantime the genuine public began to make its
appearance, and stretched in three long files between the chairs."
"The
disorderly elements began to subside, but the public, even the most
""respectable"" among them, had a dissatisfied and perplexed air; some of
the ladies looked positively scared."
At last all were seated; the music ceased.
"People began blowing their
noses and looking about them."
"They waited with too solemn an air--which
is always a bad sign."
But nothing was to be seen yet of the Lembkes.
"Silks, velvets, diamonds glowed and sparkled on every side; whiffs of
fragrance filled the air."
"The men were wearing all their decorations,
and the old men were even in uniform."
"At last the marshal's wife came in
with Liza."
"Liza had never been so dazzlingly charming or so splendidly
dressed as that morning."
"Her hair was done up in curls, her eyes
sparkled, a smile beamed on her face."
"She made an unmistakable
sensation: people scrutinised her and whispered about her."
"They said
that she was looking for Stavrogin, but neither Stavrogin nor Varvara
Petrovna were there."
"At the time I did not understand the expression
of her face: why was there so much happiness, such joy, such energy and
strength in that face?"
"I remembered what had happened the day before and
could not make it out."
But still the Lembkes did not come.
This was distinctly a blunder.
"I
learned that Yulia Mihailovna waited till the last minute for Pyotr
Stepanovitch, without whom she could not stir a step, though she never
admitted it to herself."
"I must mention, in parenthesis, that on the
previous day Pyotr Stepanovitch had at the last meeting of the committee
declined to wear the rosette of a steward, which had disappointed her
dreadfully, even to the point of tears."
"To her surprise and, later on,
her extreme discomfiture (to anticipate things) he vanished for the
whole morning and did not make his appearance at the literary matinée at
all, so that no one met him till evening."
"At last the audience began
to manifest unmistakable signs of impatience."
"No one appeared on the
platform either."
"The back rows began applauding, as in a theatre."
"The
elderly gentlemen and the ladies frowned."
"""The Lembkes are really giving
themselves unbearable airs."""
"Even among the better part of the audience
an absurd whisper began to gain ground that perhaps there would not be a
fête at all, that Lembke perhaps was really unwell, and so on and so
on."
"But, thank God, the Lembkes at last appeared, she was leaning on
his arm; I must confess I was in great apprehension myself about
their appearance."
"But the legends were disproved, and the truth
was triumphant."
The audience seemed relieved.
"Lembke himself seemed
perfectly well."
"Every one, I remember, was of that opinion, for it
can be imagined how many eyes were turned on him."
"I may mention,
as characteristic of our society, that there were very few of the
better-class people who saw reason to suppose that there was anything
wrong with him; his conduct seemed to them perfectly normal, and so much
so that the action he had taken in the square the morning before was
accepted and approved."
"""That's how it should have been from the first,"" the higher officials
declared."
"""If a man begins as a philanthropist he has to come to the
same thing in the end, though he does not see that it was necessary
from the point of view of philanthropy itself""--that, at least, was the
opinion at the club."
They only blamed him for having lost his temper.
"""It ought to have been done more coolly, but there, he is a new man,""
said the authorities."
All eyes turned with equal eagerness to Yulia Mihailovna.
"Of course no
one has the right to expect from me an exact account in regard to one
point: that is a mysterious, a feminine question."
"But I only know one
thing: on the evening of the previous day she had gone into Andrey
Antonovitch's study and was there with him till long after midnight."
Andrey Antonovitch was comforted and forgiven.
"The husband and wife came
to a complete understanding, everything was forgotten, and when at
the end of the interview Lembke went down on his knees, recalling with
horror the final incident of the previous night, the exquisite hand,
and after it the lips of his wife, checked the fervent flow of penitent
phrases of the chivalrously delicate gentleman who was limp with
emotion."
Every one could see the happiness in her face.
"She walked in
with an open-hearted air, wearing a magnificent dress."
"She seemed to
be at the very pinnacle of her heart's desires, the fête--the goal and
crown of her diplomacy--was an accomplished fact."
"As they walked
to their seats in front of the platform, the Lembkes bowed in all
directions and responded to greetings."
They were at once surrounded.
"The
marshal's wife got up to meet them."
"But at that point a horrid misunderstanding occurred; the orchestra,
apropos of nothing, struck up a flourish, not a triumphal march of any
kind, but a simple flourish such as was played at the club when some
one's health was drunk at an official dinner."
"I know now that Lyamshin,
in his capacity of steward, had arranged this, as though in honour of
the Lembkes' entrance."
"Of course he could always excuse it as a blunder
or excessive zeal.... Alas!"
"I did not know at the time that they no
longer cared even to find excuses, and that all such considerations were
from that day a thing of the past."
"But the flourish was not the end of
it: in the midst of the vexatious astonishment and the smiles of the
audience there was a sudden ""hurrah"" from the end of the hall and from
the gallery also, apparently in Lembke's honour."
"The hurrahs were few,
but I must confess they lasted for some time."
"Yulia Mihailovna flushed,
her eyes flashed."
"Lembke stood still at his chair, and turning towards
the voices sternly and majestically scanned the audience...."
"They
hastened to make him sit down."
"I noticed with dismay the same dangerous
smile on his face as he had worn the morning before, in his wife's
drawing-room, when he stared at Stepan Trofimovitch before going up to
him."
"It seemed to me that now, too, there was an ominous, and, worst of
all, a rather comic expression on his countenance, the expression of a
man resigned to sacrifice himself to satisfy his wife's lofty aims....
Yulia Mihailovna beckoned to me hurriedly, and whispered to me to run
to Karmazinov and entreat him to begin."
"And no sooner had I turned away
than another disgraceful incident, much more unpleasant than the first,
took place."
"On the platform, the empty platform, on which till that moment all eyes
and all expectations were fastened, and where nothing was to be seen but
a small table, a chair in front of it, and on the table a glass of water
on a silver salver--on the empty platform there suddenly appeared the
colossal figure of Captain Lebyadkin wearing a dress-coat and a white
tie."
I was so astounded I could not believe my eyes.
"The captain seemed
confused and remained standing at the back of the platform."
"Suddenly
there was a shout in the audience, ""Lebyadkin!"
"You?"""
"The captain's
stupid red face (he was hopelessly drunk) expanded in a broad vacant
grin at this greeting."
"He raised his hand, rubbed his forehead with it,
shook his shaggy head and, as though making up his mind to go through
with it, took two steps forward and suddenly went off into a series
of prolonged, blissful, gurgling, but not loud guffaws, which made him
screw up his eyes and set all his bulky person heaving."
"This spectacle
set almost half the audience laughing, twenty people applauded."
"The
serious part of the audience looked at one another gloomily; it all
lasted only half a minute, however."
"Liputin, wearing his steward's
rosette, ran on to the platform with two servants; they carefully took
the captain by both arms, while Liputin whispered something to him."
"The captain scowled, muttered ""Ah, well, if that's it!"""
"waved his hand,
turned his huge back to the public and vanished with his escort."
"But a
minute later Liputin skipped on to the platform again."
"He was wearing
the sweetest of his invariable smiles, which usually suggested vinegar
and sugar, and carried in his hands a sheet of note-paper."
"With tiny but
rapid steps he came forward to the edge of the platform."
"""Ladies and gentlemen,"" he said, addressing the public, ""through our
inadvertency there has arisen a comical misunderstanding which has been
removed; but I've hopefully undertaken to do something at the earnest
and most respectful request of one of our local poets."
"Deeply touched by
the humane and lofty object... in spite of his appearance... the object
which has brought us all together... to wipe away the tears of the poor
but well-educated girls of our province... this gentleman, I mean this
local poet... although desirous of preserving his incognito, would
gladly have heard his poem read at the beginning of the ball... that is,
I mean, of the matinée."
"Though this poem is not in the programme...
for it has only been received half an hour ago... yet it has seemed to
_us_""--(Us?"
Whom did he mean by us?
"I report his confused and incoherent
speech word for word)--""that through its remarkable naïveté of feeling,
together with its equally remarkable gaiety, the poem might well be
read, that is, not as something serious, but as something appropriate to
the occasion, that is to the idea... especially as some lines... And I
wanted to ask the kind permission of the audience."""
"""Read it!"""
boomed a voice at the back of the hall.
"""Then I am to read it?"""
"""Read it, read it!"""
cried many voices.
"""With the permission of the audience I will read it,"" Liputin minced
again, still with the same sugary smile."
"He still seemed to hesitate,
and I even thought that he was rather excited."
"These people are
sometimes nervous in spite of their impudence."
"A divinity student would
have carried it through without winking, but Liputin did, after all,
belong to the last generation."
"""I must say, that is, I have the honour to say by way of preface, that
it is not precisely an ode such as used to be written for fêtes, but is
rather, so to say, a jest, but full of undoubted feeling, together with
playful humour, and, so to say, the most realistic truthfulness."""
"""Read it, read it!"""
He unfolded the paper.
No one of course was in time to stop him.
"Besides, he was wearing his steward's badge."
"In a ringing voice he
declaimed:

""To the local governesses of the Fatherland from the poet at the fête:

     ""Governesses all, good morrow,
     Triumph on this festive day."
"Retrograde or vowed George-Sander--
     Never mind, just frisk away!"""
"""But that's Lebyadkin's!"
"Lebyadkin's!"""
cried several voices.
"There was
laughter and even applause, though not from very many."
"""Teaching French to wet-nosed children,
     You are glad enough to think
     You can catch a worn-out sexton--
     Even he is worth a wink!"""
"""Hurrah!"
"hurrah!"""
"""But in these great days of progress,
     Ladies, to your sorrow know,
     You can't even catch a sexton,
     If you have not got a 'dot'."""
"""To be sure, to be sure, that's realism."
"You can't hook a husband
without a 'dot'!"""
"""But, henceforth, since through our feasting
     Capital has flowed from all,
     And we send you forth to conquest
     Dancing, dowried from this hall--
     Retrograde or vowed George-Sander,
     Never mind, rejoice you may,
     You're a governess with a dowry,
     Spit on all and frisk away!"""
I must confess I could not believe my ears.
"The insolence of it was so
unmistakable that there was no possibility of excusing Liputin on
the ground of stupidity."
"Besides, Liputin was by no means stupid."
"The
intention was obvious, to me, anyway; they seemed in a hurry to create
disorder."
"Some lines in these idiotic verses, for instance the last,
were such that no stupidity could have let them pass."
"Liputin himself
seemed to feel that he had undertaken too much; when he had achieved
his exploit he was so overcome by his own impudence that he did not even
leave the platform but remained standing, as though there were something
more he wanted to say."
"He had probably imagined that it would somehow
produce a different effect; but even the group of ruffians who had
applauded during the reading suddenly sank into silence, as though they,
too, were overcome."
"What was silliest of all, many of them took the
whole episode seriously, that is, did not regard the verses as a lampoon
but actually thought it realistic and true as regards the governesses--a
poem with a tendency, in fact."
"But the excessive freedom of the verses
struck even them at last; as for the general public they were not only
scandalised but obviously offended."
"I am sure I am not mistaken as to
the impression."
"Yulia Mihailovna said afterwards that in another moment
she would have fallen into a swoon."
"One of the most respectable old
gentlemen helped his old wife on to her feet, and they walked out of the
hall accompanied by the agitated glances of the audience."
"Who knows,
the example might have infected others if Karmazinov himself, wearing a
dress-coat and a white tie and carrying a manuscript, in his hand, had
not appeared on the platform at that moment."
"Yulia Mihailovna turned
an ecstatic gaze at him as on her deliverer...."
"But I was by that time
behind the scenes."
I was in quest of Liputin.
"""You did that on purpose!"""
"I said, seizing him indignantly by the arm."
"""I assure you I never thought..."" he began, cringing and lying at once,
pretending to be unhappy."
"""The verses had only just been brought and I
thought that as an amusing pleasantry....""

""You did not think anything of the sort."
"You can't really think that
stupid rubbish an amusing pleasantry?"""
"""Yes, I do."""
"""You are simply lying, and it wasn't brought to you just now."
"You helped
Lebyadkin to compose it yourself, yesterday very likely, to create a
scandal."
"The last verse must have been yours, the part about the sexton
too."
Why did he come on in a dress-coat?
"You must have meant him to read
it, too, if he had not been drunk?"""
Liputin looked at me coldly and ironically.
"""What business is it of yours?"""
he asked suddenly with strange calm.
"""What business is it of mine?"
"You are wearing the steward's badge,
too.... Where is Pyotr Stepanovitch?"""
"""I don't know, somewhere here; why do you ask?"""
"""Because now I see through it."
"It's simply a plot against Yulia
Mihailovna so as to ruin the day by a scandal....""

Liputin looked at me askance again."
"""But what is it to you?"""
"he said, grinning."
"He shrugged his shoulders
and walked away."
It came over me with a rush.
All my suspicions were confirmed.
"Till
then, I had been hoping I was mistaken!"
What was I to do?
"I was on the
point of asking the advice of Stepan Trofimovitch, but he was standing
before the looking-glass, trying on different smiles, and continually
consulting a piece of paper on which he had notes."
"He had to go
on immediately after Karmazinov, and was not in a fit state for
conversation."
Should I run to Yulia Mihailovna?
"But it was too soon
to go to her: she needed a much sterner lesson to cure her of
her conviction that she had ""a following,"" and that every one was
""fanatically devoted"" to her."
"She would not have believed me, and would
have thought I was dreaming."
"Besides, what help could she be?"
"""Eh,"" I
thought, ""after all, what business is it of mine?"
"I'll take off my
badge and go home _when it begins._"" That was my mental phrase, ""when it
begins""; I remember it."
But I had to go and listen to Karmazinov.
"Taking a last look round
behind the scenes, I noticed that a good number of outsiders, even women
among them, were flitting about, going in and out."
"""Behind the scenes""
was rather a narrow space completely screened from the audience by a
curtain and communicating with other rooms by means of a passage."
"Here
our readers were awaiting their turns."
"But I was struck at that moment
by the reader who was to follow Stepan Trofimovitch."
"He, too, was some
sort of professor (I don't know to this day exactly what he was) who had
voluntarily left some educational institution after a disturbance among
the students, and had arrived in the town only a few days before."
"He,
too, had been recommended to Yulia Mihailovna, and she had received him
with reverence."
"I know now that he had only spent one evening in her
company before the reading; he had not spoken all that evening, had
listened with an equivocal smile to the jests and the general tone of
the company surrounding Yulia Mihailovna, and had made an unpleasant
impression on every one by his air of haughtiness, and at the same
time almost timorous readiness to take offence."
"It was Yulia Mihailovna
herself who had enlisted his services."
"Now he was walking from corner to
corner, and, like Stepan Trofimovitch, was muttering to himself, though
he looked on the ground instead of in the looking-glass."
"He was not
trying on smiles, though he often smiled rapaciously."
"It was obvious
that it was useless to speak to him either."
"He looked about forty, was
short and bald, had a greyish beard, and was decently dressed."
"But what
was most interesting about him was that at every turn he took he threw
up his right fist, brandished it above his head and suddenly brought it
down again as though crushing an antagonist to atoms."
"He went through
this by-play every moment."
It made me uncomfortable.
"I hastened away to
listen to Karmazinov."
"III

There was a feeling in the hall that something was wrong again."
"Let me
state to begin with that I have the deepest reverence for genius, but
why do our geniuses in the decline of their illustrious years behave
sometimes exactly like little boys?"
"What though he was Karmazinov, and
came forward with as much dignity as five _Kammerherrs_ rolled into one?"
"How could he expect to keep an audience like ours listening for a whole
hour to a single paper?"
"I have observed, in fact, that however big a
genius a man may be, he can't monopolise the attention of an audience at
a frivolous literary matinée for more than twenty minutes with impunity."
"The entrance of the great writer was received, indeed, with the utmost
respect: even the severest elderly men showed signs of approval and
interest, and the ladies even displayed some enthusiasm."
"The applause
was brief, however, and somehow uncertain and not unanimous."
"Yet there
was no unseemly behaviour in the back rows, till Karmazinov began to
speak, not that anything very bad followed then, but only a sort of
misunderstanding."
"I have mentioned already that he had rather a shrill
voice, almost feminine in fact, and at the same time a genuinely
aristocratic lisp."
"He had hardly articulated a few words when someone
had the effrontery to laugh aloud--probably some ignorant simpleton who
knew nothing of the world, and was congenitally disposed to laughter."
"But there was nothing like a hostile demonstration; on the contrary
people said ""sh-h!"""
and the offender was crushed.
"But Mr. Karmazinov,
with an affected air and intonation, announced that ""at first he had
declined absolutely to read."""
(Much need there was to mention it!)
"""There are some lines which come so deeply from the heart that it is
impossible to utter them aloud, so that these holy things cannot be laid
before the public""--(Why lay them then?)"
"--""but as he had been begged
to do so, he was doing so, and as he was, moreover, laying down his
pen forever, and had sworn to write no more, he had written this last
farewell; and as he had sworn never, on any inducement, to read anything
in public,"" and so on, and so on, all in that style."
"But all that would not have mattered; every one knows what authors'
prefaces are like, though, I may observe, that considering the lack of
culture of our audience and the irritability of the back rows, all this
may have had an influence."
"Surely it would have been better to have
read a little story, a short tale such as he had written in the
past--over-elaborate, that is, and affected, but sometimes witty."
"It
would have saved the situation."
"No, this was quite another story!"
"It was
a regular oration!"
"Good heavens, what wasn't there in it!"
"I am positive
that it would have reduced to rigidity even a Petersburg audience, let
alone ours."
"Imagine an article that would have filled some thirty pages
of print of the most affected, aimless prattle; and to make matters
worse, the gentleman read it with a sort of melancholy condescension
as though it were a favour, so that it was almost insulting to the
audience."
The subject.... Who could make it out?
"It was a sort of
description of certain impressions and reminiscences."
But of what?
"And
about what?"
"Though the leading intellects of the province did their
utmost during the first half of the reading, they could make nothing
of it, and they listened to the second part simply out of politeness."
"A great deal was said about love, indeed, of the love of the genius for
some person, but I must admit it made rather an awkward impression."
"For
the great writer to tell us about his first kiss seemed to my mind a
little incongruous with his short and fat little figure... Another thing
that was offensive; these kisses did not occur as they do with the rest
of mankind."
"There had to be a framework of gorse (it had to be gorse or
some such plant that one must look up in a flora) and there had to be a
tint of purple in the sky, such as no mortal had ever observed before,
or if some people had seen it, they had never noticed it, but he seemed
to say, ""I have seen it and am describing it to you, fools, as if it
were a most ordinary thing."""
"The tree under which the interesting couple
sat had of course to be of an orange colour."
"They were sitting somewhere
in Germany."
"Suddenly they see Pompey or Cassius on the eve of a battle,
and both are penetrated by a thrill of ecstasy."
"Some wood-nymph squeaked
in the bushes."
Gluck played the violin among the reeds.
"The title of the
piece he was playing was given in full, but no one knew it, so that one
would have had to look it up in a musical dictionary."
"Meanwhile a fog
came on, such a fog, such a fog, that it was more like a million pillows
than a fog."
"And suddenly everything disappears and the great genius is
crossing the frozen Volga in a thaw."
"Two and a half pages are filled
with the crossing, and yet he falls through the ice."
"The genius is
drowning--you imagine he was drowned?"
"Not a bit of it; this was simply
in order that when he was drowning and at his last gasp, he might catch
sight of a bit of ice, the size of a pea, but pure and crystal ""as a
frozen tear,"" and in that tear was reflected Germany, or more accurately
the sky of Germany, and its iridescent sparkle recalled to his mind the
very tear which ""dost thou remember, fell from thine eyes when we were
sitting under that emerald tree, and thou didst cry out joyfully: 'There
is no crime!'"
"'No,' I said through my tears, 'but if that is so, there
are no righteous either.'"
"We sobbed and parted forever."""
"She went off
somewhere to the sea coast, while he went to visit some caves, and then
he descends and descends and descends for three years under Suharev
Tower in Moscow, and suddenly in the very bowels of the earth, he finds
in a cave a lamp, and before the lamp a hermit."
The hermit is praying.
"The genius leans against a little barred window, and suddenly hears a
sigh."
Do you suppose it was the hermit sighing?
"Much he cares about the
hermit!"
"Not a bit of it, this sigh simply reminds him of her first sigh,
thirty-seven years before, ""in Germany, when, dost thou remember, we sat
under an agate tree and thou didst say to me, 'Why love?"
"See ochra is
growing all around and I love thee; but the ochra will cease to grow,
and I shall cease to love.'"""
"Then the fog comes on again, Hoffman
appears on the scene, the wood-nymph whistles a tune from Chopin, and
suddenly out of the fog appears Ancus Marcius over the roofs of Rome,
wearing a laurel wreath."
"""A chill of ecstasy ran down our backs and we
parted forever""--and so on and so on."
"Perhaps I am not reporting it quite right and don't know how to report
it, but the drift of the babble was something of that sort."
"And after
all, how disgraceful this passion of our great intellects for jesting in
a superior way really is!"
"The great European philosopher, the great man
of science, the inventor, the martyr--all these who labour and are heavy
laden, are to the great Russian genius no more than so many cooks in his
kitchen."
"He is the master and they come to him, cap in hand, awaiting
orders."
"It is true he jeers superciliously at Russia too, and there
is nothing he likes better than exhibiting the bankruptcy of Russia in
every relation before the great minds of Europe, but as regards himself,
no, he is at a higher level than all the great minds of Europe; they are
only material for his jests."
"He takes another man's idea, tacks on to it
its antithesis, and the epigram is made."
"There is such a thing as crime,
there is no such thing as crime; there is no such thing as justice,
there are no just men; atheism, Darwinism, the Moscow bells...."
"But
alas, he no longer believes in the Moscow bells; Rome, laurels...."
"But
he has no belief in laurels even.... We have a conventional attack of
Byronic spleen, a grimace from Heine, something of Petchorin--and the
machine goes on rolling, whistling, at full speed."
"""But you may praise
me, you may praise me, that I like extremely; it's only in a manner of
speaking that I lay down the pen; I shall bore you three hundred times
more, you'll grow weary of reading me....""

Of course it did not end without trouble; but the worst of it was that
it was his own doing."
"People had for some time begun shuffling their
feet, blowing their noses, coughing, and doing everything that people
do when a lecturer, whoever he may be, keeps an audience for longer than
twenty minutes at a literary matinée."
"But the genius noticed nothing of
all this."
"He went on lisping and mumbling, without giving a thought to
the audience, so that every one began to wonder."
"Suddenly in a back row
a solitary but loud voice was heard:

""Good Lord, what nonsense!"""
"The exclamation escaped involuntarily, and I am sure was not intended
as a demonstration."
The man was simply worn out.
"But Mr. Karmazinov
stopped, looked sarcastically at the audience, and suddenly lisped with
the deportment of an aggrieved _kammerherr._

""I'm afraid I've been boring you dreadfully, gentlemen?"""
"That was his blunder, that he was the first to speak; for provoking an
answer in this way he gave an opening for the rabble to speak, too, and
even legitimately, so to say, while if he had restrained himself, people
would have gone on blowing their noses and it would have passed off
somehow."
"Perhaps he expected applause in response to his question, but
there was no sound of applause; on the contrary, every one seemed to
subside and shrink back in dismay."
"""You never did see Ancus Marcius, that's all brag,"" cried a voice that
sounded full of irritation and even nervous exhaustion."
"""Just so,"" another voice agreed at once."
"""There are no such things as
ghosts nowadays, nothing but natural science."
"Look it up in a scientific
book."""
"""Gentlemen, there was nothing I expected less than such objections,""
said Karmazinov, extremely surprised."
"The great genius had completely
lost touch with his Fatherland in Karlsruhe."
"""Nowadays it's outrageous to say that the world stands on three fishes,""
a young lady snapped out suddenly."
"""You can't have gone down to the
hermit's cave, Karmazinov."
"And who talks about hermits nowadays?"""
"""Gentlemen, what surprises me most of all is that you take it all so
seriously."
"However... however, you are perfectly right."
"No one has
greater respect for truth and realism than I have....""

Though he smiled ironically he was tremendously overcome."
"His face
seemed to express: ""I am not the sort of man you think, I am on your
side, only praise me, praise me more, as much as possible, I like it
extremely....""

""Gentlemen,"" he cried, completely mortified at last, ""I see that my poor
poem is quite out of place here."
"And, indeed, I am out of place here
myself, I think."""
"""You threw at the crow and you hit the cow,"" some fool, probably drunk,
shouted at the top of his voice, and of course no notice ought to
have been taken of him."
"It is true there was a sound of disrespectful
laughter."
"""A cow, you say?"""
"Karmazinov caught it up at once, his voice grew
shriller and shriller."
"""As for crows and cows, gentlemen, I will
refrain."
"I've too much respect for any audience to permit myself
comparisons, however harmless; but I did think...""

""You'd better be careful, sir,"" someone shouted from a back row."
"""But I had supposed that laying aside my pen and saying farewell to my
readers, I should be heard...""

""No, no, we want to hear you, we want to,"" a few voices from the front
row plucked up spirit to exclaim at last."
"""Read, read!"""
"several enthusiastic ladies' voices chimed in, and at last
there was an outburst of applause, sparse and feeble, it is true."
"""Believe me, Karmazinov, every one looks on it as an honour..."" the
marshal's wife herself could not resist saying."
"""Mr."
"Karmazinov!"""
"cried a fresh young voice in the back of the hall
suddenly."
"It was the voice of a very young teacher from the district
school who had only lately come among us, an excellent young man, quiet
and gentlemanly."
He stood up in his place.
"""Mr. Karmazinov, if I had
the happiness to fall in love as you have described to us, I really
shouldn't refer to my love in an article intended for public
reading...."" He flushed red all over."
"""Ladies and gentlemen,"" cried Karmazinov, ""I have finished."
"I will omit
the end and withdraw."
"Only allow me to read the six last lines:

""Yes, dear reader, farewell!"""
"he began at once from the manuscript
without sitting down again in his chair."
"""Farewell, reader; I do not
greatly insist on our parting friends; what need to trouble you,
indeed."
"You may abuse me, abuse me as you will if it affords you any
satisfaction."
But best of all if we forget one another forever.
"And
if you all, readers, were suddenly so kind as to fall on your knees and
begin begging me with tears, 'Write, oh, write for us, Karmazinov--for
the sake of Russia, for the sake of posterity, to win laurels,' even
then I would answer you, thanking you, of course, with every courtesy,
'No, we've had enough of one another, dear fellow-countrymen, _merci!_
It's time we took our separate ways!'"
"_Merci, merci, merci!_""

Karmazinov bowed ceremoniously, and, as red as though he had been
cooked, retired behind the scenes."
"""Nobody would go down on their knees; a wild idea!"""
"""What conceit!"""
"""That's only humour,"" someone more reasonable suggested."
"""Spare me your humour."""
"""I call it impudence, gentlemen!"""
"""Well, he's finished now, anyway!"""
"""Ech, what a dull show!"""
"But all these ignorant exclamations in the back rows (though they were
confined to the back rows) were drowned in applause from the other half
of the audience."
They called for Karmazinov.
"Several ladies with Yulia
Mihailovna and the marshal's wife crowded round the platform."
"In Yulia
Mihailovna's hands was a gorgeous laurel wreath resting on another
wreath of living roses on a white velvet cushion."
"""Laurels!"""
"Karmazinov pronounced with a subtle and rather sarcastic
smile."
"""I am touched, of course, and accept with real emotion this
wreath prepared beforehand, but still fresh and unwithered, but I assure
you, mesdames, that I have suddenly become so realistic that I feel
laurels would in this age be far more appropriate in the hands of a
skilful cook than in mine....""

""Well, a cook is more useful,"" cried the divinity student, who had been
at the ""meeting"" at Virginsky's."
There was some disorder.
"In many rows people jumped up to get a better
view of the presentation of the laurel wreath."
"""I'd give another three roubles for a cook this minute,"" another voice
assented loudly, too loudly; insistently, in fact."
"""So would I."""
"""And I."""
"""Is it possible there's no buffet?..."""
"""Gentlemen, it's simply a swindle....""

It must be admitted, however, that all these unbridled gentlemen still
stood in awe of our higher officials and of the police superintendent,
who was present in the hall."
"Ten minutes later all had somehow got back
into their places, but there was not the same good order as before."
"And it was into this incipient chaos that poor Stepan Trofimovitch was
thrust."
"IV

I ran out to him behind the scenes once more, and had time to warn him
excitedly that in my opinion the game was up, that he had better not
appear at all, but had better go home at once on the excuse of his usual
ailment, for instance, and I would take off my badge and come with him."
"At that instant he was on his way to the platform; he stopped suddenly,
and haughtily looking me up and down he pronounced solemnly:

""What grounds have you, sir, for thinking me capable of such baseness?"""
I drew back.
"I was as sure as twice two make four that he would not get
off without a catastrophe."
"Meanwhile, as I stood utterly dejected, I saw
moving before me again the figure of the professor, whose turn it was to
appear after Stepan Trofimovitch, and who kept lifting up his fist
and bringing it down again with a swing."
"He kept walking up and down,
absorbed in himself and muttering something to himself with a diabolical
but triumphant smile."
I somehow almost unintentionally went up to him.
I don't know what induced me to meddle again.
"""Do you know,"" I said,
""judging from many examples, if a lecturer keeps an audience for more
than twenty minutes it won't go on listening."
"No celebrity is able to
hold his own for half an hour."""
He stopped short and seemed almost quivering with resentment.
"Infinite
disdain was expressed in his countenance."
"""Don't trouble yourself,"" he muttered contemptuously and walked on."
"At
that moment Stepan Trofimovitch's voice rang out in the hall."
"""Oh, hang you all,"" I thought, and ran to the hall."
"Stepan Trofimovitch took his seat in the lecturer's chair in the midst
of the still persisting disorder."
"He was greeted by the first rows with
looks which were evidently not over-friendly."
"(Of late, at the club,
people almost seemed not to like him, and treated him with much less
respect than formerly.)"
"But it was something to the good that he was not
hissed."
"I had had a strange idea in my head ever since the previous
day: I kept fancying that he would be received with hisses as soon as
he appeared."
"They scarcely noticed him, however, in the disorder."
"What
could that man hope for if Karmazinov was treated like this?"
"He was
pale; it was ten years since he had appeared before an audience."
"From
his excitement and from all that I knew so well in him, it was clear to
me that he, too, regarded his present appearance on the platform as a
turning-point of his fate, or something of the kind."
"That was just what
I was afraid of."
The man was dear to me.
"And what were my feelings when
he opened his lips and I heard his first phrase?"
"""Ladies and gentlemen,"" he pronounced suddenly, as though resolved to
venture everything, though in an almost breaking voice."
"""Ladies and
gentlemen!"
"Only this morning there lay before me one of the illegal
leaflets that have been distributed here lately, and I asked myself for
the hundredth time, 'Wherein lies its secret?'"""
"The whole hall became instantly still, all looks were turned to him,
some with positive alarm."
"There was no denying, he knew how to secure
their interest from the first word."
"Heads were thrust out from behind
the scenes; Liputin and Lyamshin listened greedily."
"Yulia Mihailovna
waved to me again."
"""Stop him, whatever happens, stop him,"" she whispered in agitation."
"I could only shrug my shoulders: how could one stop a man resolved to
venture everything?"
"Alas, I understood what was in Stepan Trofimovitch's
mind."
"""Ha ha, the manifestoes!"""
"was whispered in the audience; the whole hall
was stirred."
"""Ladies and gentlemen, I've solved the whole mystery."
"The whole secret
of their effect lies in their stupidity."""
(His eyes flashed.)
"""Yes,
gentlemen, if this stupidity were intentional, pretended and calculated,
oh, that would be a stroke of genius!"
"But we must do them justice:
they don't pretend anything."
"It's the barest, most simple-hearted,
most shallow stupidity."
"_C'est la bêtise dans son essence la plus pure,
quelque chose comme un simple chimique._ If it were expressed ever so
little more cleverly, every one would see at once the poverty of this
shallow stupidity."
"But as it is, every one is left wondering: no one
can believe that it is such elementary stupidity."
"'It's impossible that
there's nothing more in it,' every one says to himself and tries to
find the secret of it, sees a mystery in it, tries to read between the
lines--the effect is attained!"
"Oh, never has stupidity been so solemnly
rewarded, though it has so often deserved it.... For, _en parenthese,_
stupidity is of as much service to humanity as the loftiest genius....""

""Epigram of 1840"" was commented, in a very modest voice, however, but it
was followed by a general outbreak of noise and uproar."
"""Ladies and gentlemen, hurrah!"
"I propose a toast to stupidity!"""
"cried
Stepan Trofimovitch, defying the audience in a perfect frenzy."
I ran up on the pretext of pouring out some water for him.
"""Stepan Trofimovitch, leave off, Yulia Mihailovna entreats you to."""
"""No, you leave me alone, idle young man,"" he cried out at me at the top
of his voice."
I ran away.
"""Messieurs,"" he went on, ""why this excitement,
why the outcries of indignation I hear?"
"I have come forward with an
olive branch."
"I bring you the last word, for in this business I have the
last word--and we shall be reconciled."""
"""Down with him!"""
shouted some.
"""Hush, let him speak, let him have his say!"""
yelled another section.
"The
young teacher was particularly excited; having once brought himself to
speak he seemed now unable to be silent."
"""Messieurs, the last word in this business--is forgiveness."
"I, an old
man at the end of my life, I solemnly declare that the spirit of life
breathes in us still, and there is still a living strength in the young
generation."
"The enthusiasm of the youth of today is as pure and bright
as in our age."
"All that has happened is a change of aim, the replacing
of one beauty by another!"
"The whole difficulty lies in the question
which is more beautiful, Shakespeare or boots, Raphael or petroleum?"""
"""It's treachery!"""
growled some.
"""Compromising questions!"""
"_""Agent provocateur!"
"""_

""But I maintain,"" Stepan Trofimovitch shrilled at the utmost pitch of
excitement, ""I maintain that Shakespeare and Raphael are more precious
than the emancipation of the serfs, more precious than Nationalism, more
precious than Socialism, more precious than the young generation, more
precious than chemistry, more precious than almost all humanity because
they are the fruit, the real fruit of all humanity and perhaps the
highest fruit that can be."
"A form of beauty already attained, but for
the attaining of which I would not perhaps consent to live.... Oh,
heavens!"""
"he cried, clasping his hands, ""ten years ago I said the same
thing from the platform in Petersburg, exactly the same thing, in the
same words, and in just the same way they did not understand it, they
laughed and hissed as now; shallow people, what is lacking in you that
you cannot understand?"
"But let me tell you, let me tell you, without the
English, life is still possible for humanity, without Germany, life is
possible, without the Russians it is only too possible, without science,
without bread, life is possible--only without beauty it is impossible,
for there will be nothing left in the world."
"That's the secret at the
bottom of everything, that's what history teaches!"
"Even science would
not exist a moment without beauty--do you know that, you who laugh--it
will sink into bondage, you won't invent a nail even!..."
"I won't yield an
inch!"""
"he shouted absurdly in confusion, and with all his might banged
his fist on the table."
"But all the while that he was shrieking senselessly and incoherently,
the disorder in the hall increased."
"Many people jumped up from their
seats, some dashed forward, nearer to the platform."
"It all happened much
more quickly than I describe it, and there was no time to take steps,
perhaps no wish to, either."
"""It's all right for you, with everything found for you, you pampered
creatures!"""
"the same divinity student bellowed at the foot of the
platform, grinning with relish at Stepan Trofimovitch, who noticed it
and darted to the very edge of the platform."
"""Haven't I, haven't I just declared that the enthusiasm of the young
generation is as pure and bright as it was, and that it is coming to
grief through being deceived only in the forms of beauty!"
"Isn't that
enough for you?"
"And if you consider that he who proclaims this is a
father crushed and insulted, can one--oh, shallow hearts--can one
rise to greater heights of impartiality and fairness?..."
"Ungrateful...
unjust.... Why, why can't you be reconciled!"""
And he burst into hysterical sobs.
"He wiped away his dropping tears with
his fingers."
His shoulders and breast were heaving with sobs.
"He was
lost to everything in the world."
"A perfect panic came over the audience, almost all got up from their
seats."
"Yulia Mihailovna, too, jumped up quickly, seizing her husband by
the arm and pulling him up too...."
The scene was beyond all belief.
"""Stepan Trofimovitch!"""
the divinity student roared gleefully.
"""There's
Fedka the convict wandering about the town and the neighbourhood,
escaped from prison."
"He is a robber and has recently committed another
murder."
"Allow me to ask you: if you had not sold him as a recruit
fifteen years ago to pay a gambling debt, that is, more simply, lost
him at cards, tell me, would he have got into prison?"
"Would he have cut
men's throats now, in his struggle for existence?"
"What do you say, Mr."
"Æsthete?"""
I decline to describe the scene that followed.
"To begin with there was a
furious volley of applause."
"The applause did not come from all--probably
from some fifth part of the audience--but they applauded furiously."
"The
rest of the public made for the exit, but as the applauding part of the
audience kept pressing forward towards the platform, there was a regular
block."
"The ladies screamed, some of the girls began to cry and asked to
go home."
"Lembke, standing up by his chair, kept gazing wildly about him."
"Yulia Mihailovna completely lost her head--for the first time during her
career amongst us."
"As for Stepan Trofimovitch, for the first moment
he seemed literally crushed by the divinity student's words, but he
suddenly raised his arms as though holding them out above the public and
yelled:

""I shake the dust from off my feet and I curse you...."
"It's the end, the
end....""

And turning, he ran behind the scenes, waving his hands menacingly."
"""He has insulted the audience!..."
"Verhovensky!"""
"the angry section
roared."
They even wanted to rush in pursuit of him.
"It was impossible to
appease them, at the moment, any way, and--a final catastrophe broke
like a bomb on the assembly and exploded in its midst: the third reader,
the maniac who kept waving his fist behind the scenes, suddenly ran
on to the platform."
He looked like a perfect madman.
"With a broad,
triumphant smile, full of boundless self-confidence, he looked round at
the agitated hall and he seemed to be delighted at the disorder."
"He was
not in the least disconcerted at having to speak in such an uproar, on
the contrary, he was obviously delighted."
"This was so obvious that it
attracted attention at once."
"""What's this now?"""
people were heard asking.
"""Who is this?"
Sh-h!
"What
does he want to say?"""
"""Ladies and gentlemen,"" the maniac shouted with all his might, standing
at the very edge of the platform and speaking with almost as shrill,
feminine a voice as Karmazinov's, but without the aristocratic lisp."
"""Ladies and gentlemen!"
"Twenty years ago, on the eve of war with half
Europe, Russia was regarded as an ideal country by officials of all
ranks!"
"Literature was in the service of the censorship; military drill
was all that was taught at the universities; the troops were trained
like a ballet, and the peasants paid the taxes and were mute under the
lash of serfdom."
"Patriotism meant the wringing of bribes from the quick
and the dead."
"Those who did not take bribes were looked upon as rebels
because they disturbed the general harmony."
"The birch copses were
extirpated in support of discipline."
Europe trembled....
"But never in
the thousand years of its senseless existence had Russia sunk to such
ignominy....""

He raised his fist, waved it ecstatically and menacingly over his head
and suddenly brought it down furiously, as though pounding an adversary
to powder."
"A frantic yell rose from the whole hall, there was a
deafening roar of applause; almost half the audience was applauding:
their enthusiasm was excusable."
"Russia was being put to shame publicly,
before every one."
Who could fail to roar with delight?
"""This is the real thing!"
"Come, this is something like!"
Hurrah!
"Yes, this
is none of your æsthetics!"""
"The maniac went on ecstatically:

""Twenty years have passed since then."
"Universities have been opened and
multiplied."
"Military drill has passed into a legend; officers are too
few by thousands, the railways have eaten up all the capital and have
covered Russia as with a spider's web, so that in another fifteen years
one will perhaps get somewhere."
"Bridges are rarely on fire, and fires in
towns occur only at regular intervals, in turn, at the proper season."
"In the law courts judgments are as wise as Solomon's, and the jury only
take bribes through the struggle for existence, to escape starvation."
"The serfs are free, and flog one another instead of being flogged by
the land-owners."
"Seas and oceans of vodka are consumed to support the
budget, and in Novgorod, opposite the ancient and useless St. Sophia,
there has been solemnly put up a colossal bronze globe to celebrate a
thousand years of disorder and confusion; Europe scowls and begins to
be uneasy again.... Fifteen years of reforms!"
"And yet never even in the
most grotesque periods of its madness has Russia sunk...""

The last words could not be heard in the roar of the crowd."
"One could
see him again raise his arm and bring it down triumphantly again."
"Enthusiasm was beyond all bounds: people yelled, clapped their hands,
even some of the ladies shouted: ""Enough, you can't beat that!"""
"Some
might have been drunk."
"The orator scanned them all and seemed revelling
in his own triumph."
"I caught a glimpse of Lembke in indescribable
excitement, pointing something out to somebody."
"Yulia Mihailovna, with a
pale face, said something in haste to the prince, who had run up to her."
"But at that moment a group of six men, officials more or less, burst on
to the platform, seized the orator and dragged him behind the scenes."
"I
can't understand how he managed to tear himself away from them, but he
did escape, darted up to the edge of the platform again and succeeded in
shouting again, at the top of his voice, waving his fist: ""But never has
Russia sunk...""

But he was dragged away again."
"I saw some fifteen men dash behind the
scenes to rescue him, not crossing the platform but breaking down the
light screen at the side of it...."
"I saw afterwards, though I could
hardly believe my eyes, the girl student (Virginsky's sister) leap on
to the platform with the same roll under her arm, dressed as before,
as plump and rosy as ever, surrounded by two or three women and two or
three men, and accompanied by her mortal enemy, the schoolboy."
"I even
caught the phrase:

""Ladies and gentlemen, I've come to call attention to the sufferings
of poor students and to rouse them to a general protest...""

But I ran away."
"Hiding my badge in my pocket I made my way from the
house into the street by back passages which I knew of."
"First of all, of
course, I went to Stepan Trofimovitch's."
CHAPTER II.
"THE END OF THE FETE


I

HE WOULD NOT SEE ME."
He had shut himself up and was writing.
"At my
repeated knocks and appeals he answered through the door:

""My friend, I have finished everything."
"Who can ask anything more of
me?"""
"""You haven't finished anything, you've only helped to make a mess of the
whole thing."
"For God's sake, no epigrams, Stepan Trofimovitch!"
"Open the
door."
"We must take steps; they may still come and insult you....""

I thought myself entitled to be particularly severe and even rigorous."
I was afraid he might be going to do something still more mad.
"But to my
surprise I met an extraordinary firmness."
"""Don't be the first to insult me then."
"I thank you for the past, but
I repeat I've done with all men, good and bad."
"I am writing to Darya
Pavlovna, whom I've forgotten so unpardonably till now."
"You may take it
to her to-morrow, if you like, now _merci_."""
"""Stepan Trofimovitch, I assure you that the matter is more serious
than you think."
Do you think that you've crushed someone there?
"You've
pulverised no one, but have broken yourself to pieces like an empty
bottle."""
"(Oh, I was coarse and discourteous, I remember it with
regret.)"
"""You've absolutely no reason to write to Darya Pavlovna... and
what will you do with yourself without me?"
"What do you understand about
practical life?"
I expect you are plotting something else?
"You'll simply
come to grief again if you go plotting something more....""

He rose and came close up to the door."
"""You've not been long with them, but you've caught the infection of
their tone and language."
"_Dieu vous pardonne, mon ami, et Dieu vous
garde._ But I've always seen in you the germs of delicate feeling, and
you will get over it perhaps--_après le temps,_ of course, like all of us
Russians."
"As for what you say about my impracticability, I'll remind you
of a recent idea of mine: a whole mass of people in Russia do nothing
whatever but attack other people's impracticability with the utmost fury
and with the tiresome persistence of flies in the summer, accusing every
one of it except themselves."
"_Cher,_ remember that I am excited, and
don't distress me."
"Once more _merci_ for everything, and let us part like
Karmazinov and the public; that is, let us forget each other with as
much generosity as we can."
"He was posing in begging his former readers
so earnestly to forget him; _quant à moi,_ I am not so conceited, and I
rest my hopes on the youth of your inexperienced heart."
"How should you
remember a useless old man for long?"
"'Live more,' my friend, as Nastasya
wished me on my last name-day _(ces pauvres gens ont quelquefois des
mots charmants et pleins de philosophie)._ I do not wish you much
happiness--it will bore you."
"I do not wish you trouble either, but,
following the philosophy of the peasant, I will repeat simply 'live
more' and try not to be much bored; this useless wish I add from myself."
"Well, good-bye, and good-bye for good."
"Don't stand at my door, I will
not open it."""
He went away and I could get nothing more out of him.
"In spite of his
""excitement,"" he spoke smoothly, deliberately, with weight, obviously
trying to be impressive."
"Of course he was rather vexed with me and was
avenging himself indirectly, possibly even for the yesterday's ""prison
carts"" and ""floors that give way."""
"His tears in public that morning, in
spite of a triumph of a sort, had put him, he knew, in rather a comic
position, and there never was a man more solicitous of dignity and
punctilio in his relations with his friends than Stepan Trofimovitch."
"Oh, I don't blame him."
"But this fastidiousness and irony which he
preserved in spite of all shocks reassured me at the time."
"A man who was
so little different from his ordinary self was, of course, not in the
mood at that moment for anything tragic or extraordinary."
"So I reasoned
at the time, and, heavens, what a mistake I made!"
"I left too much out of
my reckoning."
"In anticipation of events I will quote the few first lines of the letter
to Darya Pavlovna, which she actually received the following day:

""_Mon enfant,_ my hand trembles, but I've done with everything."
"You were
not present at my last struggle: you did not come to that matinée, and
you did well to stay away."
"But you will be told that in our Russia,
which has grown so poor in men of character, one man had the courage to
stand up and, in spite of deadly menaces showered on him from all
sides, to tell the fools the truth, that is, that they are fools."
"_Oh,
ce sont--des pauvres petits vauriens et rien de plus, des
petits_--fools--_voilà le mot!_ The die is cast; I am going from this town
forever and I know not whither."
Every one I loved has turned from me.
"But you, you are a pure and naïve creature; you, a gentle being whose
life has been all but linked with mine at the will of a capricious and
imperious heart; you who looked at me perhaps with contempt when I shed
weak tears on the eve of our frustrated marriage; you, who cannot in any
case look on me except as a comic figure--for you, for you is the last
cry of my heart, for you my last duty, for you alone!"
"I cannot leave
you forever thinking of me as an ungrateful fool, a churlish egoist, as
probably a cruel and ungrateful heart--whom, alas, I cannot forget--is
every day describing me to you....""

And so on and so on, four large pages."
"Answering his ""I won't open"" with three bangs with my fist on the door,
and shouting after him that I was sure he would send Nastasya for me
three times that day, but I would not come, I gave him up and ran off to
Yulia Mihailovna."
"II

There I was the witness of a revolting scene: the poor woman was
deceived to her face, and I could do nothing."
"Indeed, what could I say
to her?"
"I had had time to reconsider things a little and reflect that
I had nothing to go upon but certain feelings and suspicious
presentiments."
"I found her in tears, almost in hysterics, with
compresses of eau-de-Cologne and a glass of water."
"Before her stood
Pyotr Stepanovitch, who talked without stopping, and the prince, who
held his tongue as though it had been under a lock."
"With tears and
lamentations she reproached Pyotr Stepanovitch for his ""desertion."""
"I
was struck at once by the fact that she ascribed the whole failure,
the whole ignominy of the matinée, everything in fact, to Pyotr
Stepanovitch's absence."
"In him I observed an important change: he seemed a shade too anxious,
almost serious."
"As a rule he never seemed serious; he was always
laughing, even when he was angry, and he was often angry."
"Oh, he was
angry now!"
"He was speaking coarsely, carelessly, with vexation and
impatience."
"He said that he had been taken ill at Gaganov's lodging,
where he had happened to go early in the morning."
"Alas, the poor woman
was so anxious to be deceived again!"
"The chief question which I found
being discussed was whether the ball, that is, the whole second half of
the fête, should or should not take place."
"Yulia Mihailovna could not be
induced to appear at the ball ""after the insults she had received that
morning""; in other words, her heart was set on being compelled to do so,
and by him, by Pyotr Stepanovitch."
"She looked upon him as an oracle, and
I believe if he had gone away she would have taken to her bed at once."
"But he did not want to go away; he was desperately anxious that the ball
should take place and that Yulia Mihailovna should be present at it."
"""Come, what is there to cry about?"
Are you set on having a scene?
"On
venting your anger on somebody?"
"Well, vent it on me; only make haste
about it, for the time is passing and you must make up your mind."
"We
made a mess of it with the matinée; we'll pick up on the ball."
"Here, the
prince thinks as I do."
"Yes, if it hadn't been for the prince, how would
things have ended there?"""
"The prince had been at first opposed to the ball (that is, opposed to
Yulia Mihailovna's appearing at it; the ball was bound to go on in any
case), but after two or three such references to his opinion he began
little by little to grunt his acquiescence."
"I was surprised too at the extraordinary rudeness of Pyotr
Stepanovitch's tone."
"Oh, I scout with indignation the contemptible
slander which was spread later of some supposed liaison between Yulia
Mihailovna and Pyotr Stepanovitch."
"There was no such thing, nor could
there be."
"He gained his ascendency over her from the first only by
encouraging her in her dreams of influence in society and in the
ministry, by entering into her plans, by inventing them for her, and
working upon her with the grossest flattery."
"He had got her completely
into his toils and had become as necessary to her as the air she
breathed."
"Seeing me, she cried, with flashing eyes:

""Here, ask him."
"He kept by my side all the while, just like the prince
did."
"Tell me, isn't it plain that it was all a preconcerted plot, a
base, designing plot to damage Andrey Antonovitch and me as much as
possible?"
"Oh, they had arranged it beforehand."
They had a plan!
"It's a
party, a regular party."""
"""You are exaggerating as usual."
"You've always some romantic notion in
your head."
"But I am glad to see Mr...."" (He pretended to have forgotten
my name.)"
"""He'll give us his opinion."""
"""My opinion,"" I hastened to put in, ""is the same as Yulia Mihailovna's."
The plot is only too evident.
"I have brought you these ribbons, Yulia
Mihailovna."
"Whether the ball is to take place or not is not my business,
for it's not in my power to decide; but my part as steward is over."
"Forgive my warmth, but I can't act against the dictates of common sense
and my own convictions."""
"""You hear!"
"You hear!"""
She clasped her hands.
"""I hear, and I tell you this."""
He turned to me.
"""I think you must
have eaten something which has made you all delirious."
"To my thinking,
nothing has happened, absolutely nothing but what has happened before
and is always liable to happen in this town."
"A plot, indeed!"
"It was an
ugly failure, disgracefully stupid."
But where's the plot?
"A plot against
Yulia Mihailovna, who has spoiled them and protected them and fondly
forgiven them all their schoolboy pranks!"
Yulia Mihailovna!
"What have I
been hammering into you for the last month continually?"
"What did I warn
you?"
"What did you want with all these people--what did you want with
them?"
What induced you to mix yourself up with these fellows?
"What was
the motive, what was the object of it?"
To unite society?
"But, mercy on
us!"
"will they ever be united?"""
"""When did you warn me?"
"On the contrary, you approved of it, you even
insisted on it...."
"I confess I am so surprised.... You brought all sorts
of strange people to see me yourself."""
"""On the contrary, I opposed you; I did not approve of it."
"As for
bringing them to see you, I certainly did, but only after they'd got
in by dozens and only of late to make up 'the literary quadrille'--we
couldn't get on without these rogues."
"Only I don't mind betting that a
dozen or two more of the same sort were let in without tickets to-day."""
"""Not a doubt of it,"" I agreed."
"""There, you see, you are agreeing already."
"Think what the tone has been
lately here--I mean in this wretched town."
"It's nothing but insolence,
impudence; it's been a crying scandal all the time."
"And who's been
encouraging it?"
Who's screened it by her authority?
"Who's upset them
all?"
Who has made all the small fry huffy?
"All their family secrets are
caricatured in your album."
"Didn't you pat them on the back, your poets
and caricaturists?"
Didn't you let Lyamshin kiss your hand?
"Didn't a
divinity student abuse an actual state councillor in your presence and
spoil his daughter's dress with his tarred boots?"
"Now, can you wonder
that the public is set against you?"""
"""But that's all your doing, yours!"
"Oh, my goodness!"""
"""No, I warned you."
We quarrelled.
"Do you hear, we quarrelled?"""
"""Why, you are lying to my face!"""
"""Of course it's easy for you to say that."
"You need a victim to vent your
wrath on."
"Well, vent it on me as I've said already."
"I'd better appeal to
you, Mr...."" (He was still unable to recall my name.)"
"""We'll reckon
on our fingers."
"I maintain that, apart from Liputin, there was nothing
preconcerted, nothing!"
"I will prove it, but first let us analyse
Liputin."
He came forward with that fool Lebyadkin's verses.
"Do you
maintain that that was a plot?"
"But do you know it might simply have
struck Liputin as a clever thing to do."
"Seriously, seriously."
"He simply
came forward with the idea of making every one laugh and entertaining
them--his protectress Yulia Mihailovna first of all."
That was all.
"Don't
you believe it?"
"Isn't that in keeping with all that has been going
on here for the last month?"
Do you want me to tell the whole truth?
"I
declare that under other circumstances it might have gone off all right."
"It was a coarse joke--well, a bit strong, perhaps; but it was amusing,
you know, wasn't it?"""
"""What!"
"You think what Liputin did was clever?"""
"Yulia Mihailovna cried
in intense indignation."
"""Such stupidity, such tactlessness, so
contemptible, so mean!"
It was intentional!
"Oh, you are saying it on
purpose!"
"I believe after that you are in the plot with them yourself."""
"""Of course I was behind the scenes, I was in hiding, I set it all going."
"But if I were in the plot--understand that, anyway--it wouldn't have
ended with Liputin."
"So according to you I had arranged with my papa too
that he should cause such a scene on purpose?"
"Well, whose fault is it
that my papa was allowed to read?"
"Who tried only yesterday to prevent
you from allowing it, only yesterday?"""
"""_Oh, hier il avait tant d'esprit,_ I was so reckoning on him; and then he
has such manners."
"I thought with him and Karmazinov... Only think!"""
"""Yes, only think."
"But in spite of _tant d'esprit_ papa has made things
worse, and if I'd known beforehand that he'd make such a mess of it, I
should certainly not have persuaded you yesterday to keep the goat
out of the kitchen garden, should I--since I am taking part in this
conspiracy against your fête that you are so positive about?"
"And yet I
did try to dissuade you yesterday; I tried to because I foresaw it."
"To
foresee everything was, of course, impossible; he probably did not know
himself a minute before what he would fire off--these nervous old men
can't be reckoned on like other people."
"But you can still save
the situation: to satisfy the public, send to him to-morrow by
administrative order, and with all the ceremonies, two doctors to
inquire into his health."
"Even to-day, in fact, and take him straight to
the hospital and apply cold compresses."
"Every one would laugh, anyway,
and see that there was nothing to take offence at."
"I'll tell people
about it in the evening at the ball, as I am his son."
"Karmazinov is
another story."
"He was a perfect ass and dragged out his article for a
whole hour."
He certainly must have been in the plot with me!
"'I'll make
a mess of it too,' he thought, 'to damage Yulia Mihailovna.'"""
"""Oh, Karmazinov!"
"_Quelle honte!_ I was burning, burning with shame for his
audience!"""
"""Well, I shouldn't have burnt, but have cooked him instead."
"The audience
was right, you know."
"Who was to blame for Karmazinov, again?"
"Did I foist
him upon you?"
Was I one of his worshippers?
"Well, hang him!"
"But the
third maniac, the political--that's a different matter."
"That was every
one's blunder, not only my plot."""
"""Ah, don't speak of it!"
"That was awful, awful!"
"That was my fault,
entirely my fault!"""
"""Of course it was, but I don't blame you for that."
"No one can control
them, these candid souls!"
"You can't always be safe from them, even in
Petersburg."
"He was recommended to you, and in what terms too!"
"So you
will admit that you are bound to appear at the ball to-night."
"It's an
important business."
It was you put him on to the platform.
"You must make
it plain now to the public that you are not in league with him, that
the fellow is in the hands of the police, and that you were in some
inexplicable way deceived."
"You ought to declare with indignation that
you were the victim of a madman."
"Because he is a madman and nothing
more."
That's how you must put it about him.
"I can't endure these people
who bite."
"I say worse things perhaps, but not from the platform, you
know."
"And they are talking about a senator too."""
"""What senator?"
"Who's talking?"""
"""I don't understand it myself, you know."
"Do you know anything about a
senator, Yulia Mihailovna?"""
"""A senator?"""
"""You see, they are convinced that a senator has been appointed to be
governor here, and that you are being superseded from Petersburg."
"I've
heard it from lots of people."""
"""I've heard it too,"" I put in."
"""Who said so?"""
"asked Yulia Mihailovna, flushing all over."
"""You mean, who said so first?"
How can I tell?
"But there it is, people
say so."
Masses of people are saying so.
"They were saying so yesterday
particularly."
"They are all very serious about it, though I can't make it
out."
"Of course the more intelligent and competent don't talk, but even
some of those listen."""
"""How mean!"
"And... how stupid!"""
"""Well, that's just why you must make your appearance, to show these
fools."""
"""I confess I feel myself that it's my duty, but... what if there's
another disgrace in store for us?"
What if people don't come?
"No one will
come, you know, no one!"""
"""How hot you are!"
They not come!
What about the new clothes?
"What about
the girls' dresses?"
I give you up as a woman after that!
"Is that your
knowledge of human nature?"""
"""The marshal's wife won't come, she won't."""
"""But, after all, what has happened?"
"Why won't they come?"""
"he cried at
last with angry impatience."
"""Ignominy, disgrace--that's what's happened."
"I don't know what to call
it, but after it I can't face people."""
"""Why?"
"How are you to blame for it, after all?"
"Why do you take the blame
of it on yourself?"
"Isn't it rather the fault of the audience, of
your respectable residents, your patresfamilias?"
"They ought to have
controlled the roughs and the rowdies--for it was all the work of roughs
and rowdies, nothing serious."
"You can never manage things with the
police alone in any society, anywhere."
"Among us every one asks for
a special policeman to protect him wherever he goes."
"People don't
understand that society must protect itself."
"And what do our
patresfamilias, the officials, the wives and daughters, do in such
cases?"
They sit quiet and sulk.
"In fact there's not enough social
initiative to keep the disorderly in check."""
"""Ah, that's the simple truth!"
"They sit quiet, sulk and... gaze about
them."""
"""And if it's the truth, you ought to say so aloud, proudly, sternly,
just to show that you are not defeated, to those respectable residents
and mothers of families."
"Oh, you can do it; you have the gift when your
head is clear."
You will gather them round you and say it aloud.
"And
then a paragraph in the _Voice_ and the _Financial News._ Wait a bit, I'll
undertake it myself, I'll arrange it all for you."
"Of course there must
be more superintendence: you must look after the buffet; you must ask
the prince, you must ask Mr.... You must not desert us, monsieur, just
when we have to begin all over again."
"And finally, you must appear
arm-in-arm with Andrey Antonovitch.... How is Andrey Antonovitch?"""
"""Oh, how unjustly, how untruly, how cruelly you have always judged that
angelic man!"""
"Yulia Mihailovna cried in a sudden, outburst, almost with
tears, putting her handkerchief to her eyes."
Pyotr Stepanovitch was positively taken aback for the moment.
"""Good
heavens!"
I.... What have I said?
"I've always...""

""You never have, never!"
"You have never done him justice."""
"""There's no understanding a woman,"" grumbled Pyotr Stepanovitch, with a
wry smile."
"""He is the most sincere, the most delicate, the most angelic of men!"
"The
most kind-hearted of men!"""
"""Well, really, as for kind-heartedness..."
"I've always done him
justice....""

""Never!"
But let us drop it.
I am too awkward in my defence of him.
"This morning that little Jesuit, the marshal's wife, also dropped some
sarcastic hints about what happened yesterday."""
"""Oh, she has no thoughts to spare for yesterday now, she is full of
to-day."
And why are you so upset at her not coming to the ball to-night?
"Of course, she won't come after getting mixed up in such a scandal."
"Perhaps it's not her fault, but still her reputation... her hands are
soiled."""
"""What do you mean; I don't understand?"
"Why are her hands soiled?"""
"Yulia
Mihailovna looked at him in perplexity."
"""I don't vouch for the truth of it, but the town is ringing with the
story that it was she brought them together."""
"""What do you mean?"
"Brought whom together?"""
"""What, do you mean to say you don't know?"""
"he exclaimed with
well-simulated wonder."
"""Why Stavrogin and Lizaveta Nikolaevna."""
"""What?"
"How?"""
we all cried out at once.
"""Is it possible you don't know?"
Phew!
"Why, it is quite a tragic romance:
Lizaveta Nikolaevna was pleased to get out of that lady's carriage
and get straight into Stavrogin's carriage, and slipped off with 'the
latter' to Skvoreshniki in full daylight."
"Only an hour ago, hardly an
hour."""
We were flabbergasted.
"Of course we fell to questioning him, but to our
wonder, although he ""happened"" to be a witness of the scene himself,
he could give us no detailed account of it."
"The thing seemed to have
happened like this: when the marshal's wife was driving Liza and Mavriky
Nikolaevitch from the matinée to the house of Praskovya Ivanovna (whose
legs were still bad) they saw a carriage waiting a short distance, about
twenty-five paces, to one side of the front door."
"When Liza jumped out,
she ran straight to this carriage; the door was flung open and shut
again; Liza called to Mavriky Nikolaevitch, ""Spare me,"" and the carriage
drove off at full speed to Skvoreshniki."
"To our hurried questions
whether it was by arrangement?"
Who was in the carriage?
"Pyotr
Stepanovitch answered that he knew nothing about it; no doubt it had
been arranged, but that he did not see Stavrogin himself; possibly the
old butler, Alexey Yegorytch, might have been in the carriage."
"To the
question ""How did he come to be there, and how did he know for a fact
that she had driven to Skvoreshniki?"""
"he answered that he happened to be
passing and, at seeing Liza, he had run up to the carriage (and yet he
could not make out who was in it, an inquisitive man like him!)"
"and
that Mavriky Nikolaevitch, far from setting off in pursuit, had not
even tried to stop Liza, and had even laid a restraining hand on the
marshal's wife, who was shouting at the top of her voice: ""She is going
to Stavrogin, to Stavrogin."""
"At this point I lost patience, and cried
furiously to Pyotr Stepanovitch:

""It's all your doing, you rascal!"
"This was what you were doing this
morning."
"You helped Stavrogin, you came in the carriage, you helped her
into it... it was you, you, you!"
"Yulia Mihailovna, he is your enemy; he
will be your ruin too!"
"Beware of him!"""
And I ran headlong out of the house.
"I wonder myself and cannot make out
to this day how I came to say that to him."
"But I guessed quite right:
it had all happened almost exactly as I said, as appeared later."
"What
struck me most was the obviously artificial way in which he broke
the news."
"He had not told it at once on entering the house as an
extraordinary piece of news, but pretended that we knew without his
telling us which was impossible in so short a time."
"And if we had known
it, we could not possibly have refrained from mentioning it till he
introduced the subject."
"Besides, he could not have heard yet that the
town was ""ringing with gossip"" about the marshal's wife in so short a
time."
"Besides, he had once or twice given a vulgar, frivolous smile
as he told the story, probably considering that we were fools and
completely taken in."
"But I had no thought to spare for him; the central fact I believed, and
ran from Yulia Mihailovna's, beside myself."
"The catastrophe cut me
to the heart."
"I was wounded almost to tears; perhaps I did shed
some indeed."
I was at a complete loss what to do.
"I rushed to Stepan
Trofimovitch's, but the vexatious man still refused to open the door."
"Nastasya informed me, in a reverent whisper, that he had gone to bed,
but I did not believe it."
"At Liza's house I succeeded in questioning the
servants."
"They confirmed the story of the elopement, but knew nothing
themselves."
"There was great commotion in the house; their mistress had
been attacked by fainting fits, and Mavriky Nikolaevitch was with her."
I did not feel it possible to ask for Mavriky Nikolaevitch.
"To my
inquiries about Pyotr Stepanovitch they told me that he had been in and
out continually of late, sometimes twice in the day."
"The servants were
sad, and showed particular respectfulness in speaking of Liza; they were
fond of her."
"That she was ruined, utterly ruined, I did not doubt;
but the psychological aspect of the matter I was utterly unable to
understand, especially after her scene with Stavrogin the previous day."
"To run about the town and inquire at the houses of acquaintances, who
would, of course, by now have heard the news and be rejoicing at it,
seemed to me revolting, besides being humiliating for Liza."
"But, strange
to say, I ran to see Darya Pavlovna, though I was not admitted (no one
had been admitted into the house since the previous morning)."
"I don't
know what I could have said to her and what made me run to her."
"From her
I went to her brother's."
Shatov listened sullenly and in silence.
"I may
observe that I found him more gloomy than I had ever seen him before; he
was awfully preoccupied and seemed only to listen to me with an effort."
"He said scarcely anything and began walking up and down his cell from
corner to corner, treading more noisily than usual."
"As I was going down
the stairs he shouted after me to go to Liputin's: ""There you'll hear
everything."""
"Yet I did not go to Liputin's, but after I'd gone a good
way towards home I turned back to Shatov's again, and, half opening the
door without going in, suggested to him laconically and with no kind of
explanation, ""Won't you go to Marya Timofyevna to-day?"""
"At this Shatov
swore at me, and I went away."
"I note here that I may not forget it that
he did purposely go that evening to the other end of the town to see
Marya Timofyevna, whom he had not seen for some time."
"He found her in
excellent health and spirits and Lebyadkin dead drunk, asleep on the
sofa in the first room."
This was at nine o'clock.
"He told me so himself
next day when we met for a moment in the street."
"Before ten o'clock I
made up my mind to go to the ball, but not in the capacity of a steward
(besides my rosette had been left at Yulia Mihailovna's)."
"I was tempted
by irresistible curiosity to listen, without asking any questions,
to what people were saying in the town about all that had happened."
"I
wanted, too, to have a look at Yulia Mihailovna, if only at a distance."
"I reproached myself greatly that I had left her so abruptly that
afternoon."
"III

All that night, with its almost grotesque incidents, and the terrible
_dénouement_ that followed in the early morning, still seems to me like a
hideous nightmare, and is, for me at least, the most painful chapter
in my chronicle."
"I was late for the ball, and it was destined to end
so quickly that I arrived not long before it was over."
"It was eleven
o'clock when I reached the entrance of the marshal's house, where the
same White Hall in which the matinée had taken place had, in spite of
the short interval between, been cleared and made ready to serve as the
chief ballroom for the whole town, as we expected, to dance in."
"But far
as I had been that morning from expecting the ball to be a success, I
had had no presentiment of the full truth."
"Not one family of the
higher circles appeared; even the subordinate officials of rather more
consequence were absent--and this was a very striking fact."
"As for
ladies and girls, Pyotr Stepanovitch's arguments (the duplicity of which
was obvious now) turned out to be utterly incorrect: exceedingly few
had come; to four men there was scarcely one lady--and what ladies
they were!"
"Regimental ladies of a sort, three doctors' wives with
their daughters, two or three poor ladies from the country, the seven
daughters and the niece of the secretary whom I have mentioned already,
some wives of tradesmen, of post-office clerks and other small fry--was
this what Yulia Mihailovna expected?"
"Half the tradespeople even were
absent."
"As for the men, in spite of the complete absence of all persons
of consequence, there was still a crowd of them, but they made a
doubtful and suspicious impression."
"There were, of course, some quiet
and respectful officers with their wives, some of the most docile
fathers of families, like that secretary, for instance, the father of
his seven daughters."
"All these humble, insignificant people had come, as
one of these gentlemen expressed it, because it was ""inevitable."""
"But,
on the other hand, the mass of free-and-easy people and the mass too of
those whom Pyotr Stepanovitch and I had suspected of coming in without
tickets, seemed even bigger than in the afternoon."
"So far they were all
sitting in the refreshment bar, and had gone straight there on arriving,
as though it were the meeting-place they had agreed upon."
"So at least it
seemed to me."
"The refreshment bar had been placed in a large room,
the last of several opening out of one another."
"Here Prohoritch was
installed with all the attractions of the club cuisine and with a
tempting display of drinks and dainties."
"I noticed several persons whose
coats were almost in rags and whose get-up was altogether suspicious and
utterly unsuitable for a ball."
"They had evidently been with great pains
brought to a state of partial sobriety which would not last long; and
goodness knows where they had been brought from, they were not local
people."
"I knew, of course, that it was part of Yulia Mihailovna's idea
that the ball should be of the most democratic character, and that ""even
working people and shopmen should not be excluded if any one of that
class chanced to pay for a ticket."""
"She could bravely utter such words
in her committee with absolute security that none of the working people
of our town, who all lived in extreme poverty, would dream of taking a
ticket."
"But in spite of the democratic sentiments of the committee, I
could hardly believe that such sinister-looking and shabby people could
have been admitted in the regular way."
"But who could have admitted them,
and with what object?"
"Lyamshin and Liputin had already been deprived of
their steward's rosettes, though they were present at the ball, as they
were taking part in the ""literary quadrille."""
"But, to my amazement,
Liputin's place was taken by the divinity student, who had caused
the greatest scandal at the matinée by his skirmish with Stepan
Trofimovitch; and Lyamshin's was taken by Pyotr Stepanovitch himself."
What was to be looked for under the circumstances?
I tried to listen to the conversation.
"I was struck by the wildness
of some ideas I heard expressed."
"It was maintained in one group, for
instance, that Yulia Mihailovna had arranged Liza's elopement with
Stavrogin and had been paid by the latter for doing so."
"Even the sum
paid was mentioned."
"It was asserted that she had arranged the whole fête
with a view to it, and that that was the reason why half the town had
not turned up at the ball, and that Lembke himself was so upset about it
that ""his mind had given way,"" and that, crazy as he was, ""she had got
him in tow."""
"There was a great deal of laughter too, hoarse, wild
and significant."
"Every one was criticising the ball, too, with great
severity, and abusing Yulia Mihailovna without ceremony."
"In fact it was
disorderly, incoherent, drunken and excited babble, so it was difficult
to put it together and make anything of it."
"At the same time there were
simple-hearted people enjoying themselves at the refreshment-bar; there
were even some ladies of the sort who are surprised and frightened at
nothing, very genial and festive, chiefly military ladies with their
husbands."
"They made parties at the little tables, were drinking tea, and
were very merry."
"The refreshment-bar made a snug refuge for almost half
of the guests."
"Yet in a little time all this mass of people must stream
into the ballroom."
It was horrible to think of it!
"Meanwhile the prince had succeeded in arranging three skimpy quadrilles
in the White Hall."
"The young ladies were dancing, while their parents
were enjoying watching them."
"But many of these respectable persons had
already begun to think how they could, after giving their girls a treat,
get off in good time before ""the trouble began."""
"Absolutely every one
was convinced that it certainly would begin."
"It would be difficult for
me to describe Yulia Mihailovna's state of mind."
"I did not talk to her
though I went close up to her."
"She did not respond to the bow I made her
on entering; she did not notice me (really did not notice)."
"There was a
painful look in her face and a contemptuous and haughty though restless
and agitated expression in her eyes."
"She controlled herself with evident
suffering--for whose sake, with what object?"
"She certainly ought to have
gone away, still more to have got her husband away, and she remained!"
"From her face one could see that her eyes were ""fully opened,"" and
that it was useless for her to expect any thing more."
"She did not even
summon Pyotr Stepanovitch (he seemed to avoid her; I saw him in the
refreshment-room, he was extremely lively)."
"But she remained at the ball
and did not let Andrey Antonovitch leave her side for a moment."
"Oh, up
to the very last moment, even that morning she would have repudiated any
hint about his health with genuine indignation."
"But now her eyes were
to be opened on this subject too."
"As for me, I thought from the first
glance that Andrey Antonovitch looked worse than he had done in the
morning."
"He seemed to be plunged into a sort of oblivion and hardly
to know where he was."
"Sometimes he looked about him with unexpected
severity--at me, for instance, twice."
"Once he tried to say something;
he began loudly and audibly but did not finish the sentence, throwing
a modest old clerk who happened to be near him almost into a panic."
"But
even this humble section of the assembly held sullenly and timidly
aloof from Yulia Mihailovna and at the same time turned upon her husband
exceedingly strange glances, open and staring, quite out of keeping with
their habitually submissive demeanour."
"""Yes, that struck me, and I suddenly began to guess about Andrey
Antonovitch,"" Yulia Mihailovna confessed to me afterwards."
"Yes, she was to blame again!"
"Probably when after my departure she had
settled with Pyotr Stepanovitch that there should be a ball and that
she should be present she must have gone again to the study where Andrey
Antonovitch was sitting, utterly ""shattered"" by the matinée; must again
have used all her fascinations to persuade him to come with her."
"But
what misery she must have been in now!"
And yet she did not go away.
"Whether it was pride or simply she lost her head, I do not know."
"In
spite of her haughtiness, she attempted with smiles and humiliation
to enter into conversation with some ladies, but they were confused,
confined themselves to distrustful monosyllables, ""Yes"" and ""No,"" and
evidently avoided her."
"The only person of undoubted consequence who was present at the ball was
that distinguished general whom I have described already, the one who
after Stavrogin's duel with Gaganov opened the door to public impatience
at the marshal's wife's."
"He walked with an air of dignity through the
rooms, looked about, and listened, and tried to appear as though he had
come rather for the sake of observation than for the sake of enjoying
himself...."
"He ended by establishing himself beside Yulia Mihailovna
and not moving a step away from her, evidently trying to keep up her
spirits, and reassure her."
"He certainly was a most kind-hearted man,
of very high rank, and so old that even compassion from him was not
wounding."
"But to admit to herself that this old gossip was venturing to
pity her and almost to protect her, knowing that he was doing her honour
by his presence, was very vexatious."
"The general stayed by her and never
ceased chattering."
"""They say a town can't go on without seven righteous men... seven, I
think it is, I am not sure of the number fixed...."
"I don't know how many
of these seven, the certified righteous of the town... have the honour
of being present at your ball."
"Yet in spite of their presence I begin
to feel unsafe."
"_Vous me pardonnez, charmante dame, n'est-ce pas?_ I speak
allegorically, but I went into the refreshment-room and I am glad I
escaped alive.... Our priceless Prohoritch is not in his place there,
and I believe his bar will be destroyed before morning."
"But I am
laughing."
"I am only waiting to see what the 'literary quadrille' is
going to be like, and then home to bed."
"You must excuse a gouty old
fellow."
"I go early to bed, and I would advise you too to go 'by-by,' as
they say _aux enfants._ I've come, you know, to have a look at the pretty
girls... whom, of course, I could meet nowhere in such profusion as
here."
They all live beyond the river and I don't drive out so far.
"There's a wife of an officer... in the chasseurs I believe he is...
who is distinctly pretty, distinctly, and... she knows it herself."
"I've
talked to the sly puss; she is a sprightly one... and the girls too are
fresh-looking; but that's all, there's nothing but freshness."
"Still,
it's a pleasure to look at them."
"There are some rosebuds, but their
lips are thick."
"As a rule there's an irregularity about female beauty
in Russia, and... they are a little like buns.... _vous me pardonnez,
n'est-ce pas?_... with good eyes, however, laughing eyes...."
"These
rose buds are charming for two years when they are young... even for
three... then they broaden out and are spoilt forever... producing
in their husbands that deplorable indifference which does so much to
promote the woman movement... that is, if I understand it correctly....
H'm!"
It's a fine hall; the rooms are not badly decorated.
"It might be
worse."
The music might be much worse....
"I don't say it ought to have
been."
What makes a bad impression is that there are so few ladies.
"I say
nothing about the dresses."
"It's bad that that chap in the grey trousers
should dare to dance the cancan so openly."
"I can forgive him if he does
it in the gaiety of his heart, and since he is the local chemist...."
"Still, eleven o'clock is a bit early even for chemists."
"There were two
fellows fighting in the refreshment-bar and they weren't turned out."
"At
eleven o'clock people ought to be turned out for fighting, whatever the
standard of manners.... Three o'clock is a different matter; then one
has to make concessions to public opinion--if only this ball survives
till three o'clock."
"Varvara Petrovna has not kept her word, though, and
hasn't sent flowers."
H'm!
"She has no thoughts for flowers, _pauvre mère!_
And poor Liza!"
Have you heard?
"They say it's a mysterious story...
and Stavrogin is to the front again.... H'm!"
"I would have gone home
to bed..."
I can hardly keep my eyes open.
"But when is this 'literary
quadrille' coming on?"""
"At last the ""literary quadrille"" began."
"Whenever of late there had been
conversation in the town on the ball it had invariably turned on this
literary quadrille, and as no one could imagine what it would be like,
it aroused extraordinary curiosity."
"Nothing could be more unfavourable
to its chance of success, and great was the disappointment."
"The side doors of the White Hall were thrown open and several masked
figures appeared."
The public surrounded them eagerly.
"All the occupants
of the refreshment-bar trooped to the last man into the hall."
"The masked
figures took their places for the dance."
"I succeeded in making my way to
the front and installed myself just behind Yulia Mihailovna, Von Lembke,
and the general."
"At this point Pyotr Stepanovitch, who had kept away
till that time, skipped up to Yulia Mihailovna."
"""I've been in the refreshment-room all this time, watching,"" he
whispered, with the air of a guilty schoolboy, which he, however,
assumed on purpose to irritate her even more."
"She turned crimson with
anger."
"""You might give up trying to deceive me now at least, insolent man!"""
"broke from her almost aloud, so that it was heard by other people."
"Pyotr
Stepanovitch skipped away extremely well satisfied with himself."
"It would be difficult to imagine a more pitiful, vulgar, dull and
insipid allegory than this ""literary quadrille."""
"Nothing could be
imagined less appropriate to our local society."
"Yet they say it was
Karmazinov's idea."
"It was Liputin indeed who arranged it with the help
of the lame teacher who had been at the meeting at Virginsky's."
"But
Karmazinov had given the idea and had, it was said, meant to dress up
and to take a special and prominent part in it."
"The quadrille was
made up of six couples of masked figures, who were not in fancy dress
exactly, for their clothes were like every one else's."
"Thus, for
instance, one short and elderly gentleman wearing a dress-coat--in fact,
dressed like every one else--wore a venerable grey beard, tied on (and this
constituted his disguise)."
"As he danced he pounded up and down, taking
tiny and rapid steps on the same spot with a stolid expression of
countenance."
"He gave vent to sounds in a subdued but husky bass, and
this huskiness was meant to suggest one of the well-known papers."
"Opposite this figure danced two giants, X and Z, and these letters were
pinned on their coats, but what the letters meant remained unexplained."
"""Honest Russian thought"" was represented by a middle-aged gentleman in
spectacles, dress-coat and gloves, and wearing fetters (real fetters)."
"Under his arm he had a portfolio containing papers relating to some
""case."""
"To convince the sceptical, a letter from abroad testifying to
the honesty of ""honest Russian thought"" peeped out of his pocket."
"All
this was explained by the stewards, as the letter which peeped out of
his pocket could not be read."
"""Honest Russian thought"" had his right
hand raised and in it held a glass as though he wanted to propose a
toast."
"In a line with him on each side tripped a crop-headed Nihilist
girl; while _vis-à-vis_ danced another elderly gentleman in a dress-coat
with a heavy cudgel in his hand."
"He was meant to represent a formidable
periodical (not a Petersburg one), and seemed to be saying, ""I'll
pound you to a jelly."""
"But in spite of his cudgel he could not bear the
spectacles of ""honest Russian thought"" fixed upon him and tried to look
away, and when he did the _pas de deux,_ he twisted, turned, and did not
know what to do with himself--so terrible, probably, were the stings
of his conscience!"
"I don't remember all the absurd tricks they played,
however; it was all in the same style, so that I felt at last painfully
ashamed."
"And this same expression, as it were, of shame was reflected in
the whole public, even on the most sullen figures that had come out of
the refreshment-room."
"For some time all were silent and gazed with angry
perplexity."
"When a man is ashamed he generally begins to get angry and
is disposed to be cynical."
By degrees a murmur arose in the audience.
"""What's the meaning of it?"""
"a man who had come in from the
refreshment-room muttered in one of the groups."
"""It's silly."""
"""It's something literary."
"It's a criticism of the _Voice_."""
"""What's that to me?"""
"From another group:

""Asses!"""
"""No, they are not asses; it's we who are the asses."""
"""Why are you an ass?"""
"""I am not an ass."""
"""Well, if you are not, I am certainly not."""
"From a third group:

""We ought to give them a good smacking and send them flying."""
"""Pull down the hall!"""
"From a fourth group:

""I wonder the Lembkes are not ashamed to look on!"""
"""Why should they be ashamed?"
"You are not."""
"""Yes, I am ashamed, and he is the governor."""
"""And you are a pig."""
"""I've never seen such a commonplace ball in my life,"" a lady observed
viciously, quite close to Yulia Mihailovna, obviously with the intention
of being overheard."
"She was a stout lady of forty with rouge on her
cheeks, wearing a bright-coloured silk dress."
"Almost every one in the
town knew her, but no one received her."
"She was the widow of a civil
councillor, who had left her a wooden house and a small pension; but
she lived well and kept horses."
"Two months previously she had called on
Yulia Mihailovna, but the latter had not received her."
"""That might have been foreseen,"" she added, looking insolently into
Yulia Mihailovna's face."
"""If you could foresee it, why did you come?"""
"Yulia Mihailovna could not
resist saying."
"""Because I was too simple,"" the sprightly lady answered instantly, up in
arms and eager for the fray; but the general intervened."
"_""Chère dame""_--he bent over to Yulia Mihailovna--""you'd really better be
going."
"We are only in their way and they'll enjoy themselves thoroughly
without us."
"You've done your part, you've opened the ball, now leave
them in peace."
"And Andrey Antonovitch doesn't seem to be feeling quite
satisfactorily.... To avoid trouble."""
But it was too late.
"All through the quadrille Andrey Antonovitch gazed at the dancers with a
sort of angry perplexity, and when he heard the comments of the audience
he began looking about him uneasily."
"Then for the first time he caught
sight of some of the persons who had come from the refreshment-room;
there was an expression of extreme wonder in his face."
"Suddenly there
was a loud roar of laughter at a caper that was cut in the quadrille."
"The editor of the ""menacing periodical, not a Petersburg one,"" who was
dancing with the cudgel in his hands, felt utterly unable to endure
the spectacled gaze of ""honest Russian thought,"" and not knowing how to
escape it, suddenly in the last figure advanced to meet him standing on
his head, which was meant, by the way, to typify the continual turning
upside down of common sense by the menacing non-Petersburg gazette."
"As
Lyamshin was the only one who could walk standing on his head, he had
undertaken to represent the editor with the cudgel."
"Yulia Mihailovna had
had no idea that anyone was going to walk on his head."
"""They concealed
that from me, they concealed it,"" she repeated to me afterwards in
despair and indignation."
"The laughter from the crowd was, of course,
provoked not by the allegory, which interested no one, but simply by
a man's walking on his head in a swallow-tail coat."
"Lembke flew into a
rage and shook with fury."
"""Rascal!"""
"he cried, pointing to Lyamshin, ""take hold of the scoundrel,
turn him over... turn his legs... his head... so that his head's up..."
"up!"""
Lyamshin jumped on to his feet.
The laughter grew louder.
"""Turn out all the scoundrels who are laughing!"""
"Lembke prescribed
suddenly."
There was an angry roar and laughter in the crowd.
"""You can't do like that, your Excellency."""
"""You mustn't abuse the public."""
"""You are a fool yourself!"""
a voice cried suddenly from a corner.
"""Filibusters!"""
shouted someone from the other end of the room.
Lembke looked round quickly at the shout and turned pale.
"A vacant smile
came on to his lips, as though he suddenly understood and remembered
something."
"""Gentlemen,"" said Yulia Mihailovna, addressing the crowd which was
pressing round them, as she drew her husband away--""gentlemen, excuse
Andrey Antonovitch."
"Andrey Antonovitch is unwell... excuse... forgive
him, gentlemen."""
"I positively heard her say ""forgive him."""
It all happened very quickly.
"But I remember for a fact that a section of the public rushed out of
the hall immediately after those words of Yulia Mihailovna's as though
panic-stricken."
"I remember one hysterical, tearful feminine shriek:

""Ach, the same thing again!"""
"And in the retreat of the guests, which was almost becoming a crush,
another bomb exploded exactly as in the afternoon."
"""Fire!"
"All the riverside quarter is on fire!"""
"I don't remember where this terrible cry rose first, whether it was
first raised in the hall, or whether someone ran upstairs from the
entry, but it was followed by such alarm that I can't attempt to
describe it."
"More than half the guests at the ball came from the quarter
beyond the river, and were owners or occupiers of wooden houses in that
district."
"They rushed to the windows, pulled back the curtains in a
flash, and tore down the blinds."
The riverside was in flames.
"The fire,
it is true, was only beginning, but it was in flames in three separate
places--and that was what was alarming."
"""Arson!"
"The Shpigulin men!"""
roared the crowd.
"I remember some very characteristic exclamations:

""I've had a presentiment in my heart that there'd be arson, I've had a
presentiment of it these last few days!"""
"""The Shpigulin men, the Shpigulin men, no one else!"""
"""We were all lured here on purpose to set fire to it!"""
"This last most amazing exclamation came from a woman; it was an
unintentional involuntary shriek of a housewife whose goods were
burning."
Every one rushed for the door.
"I won't describe the crush in
the vestibule over sorting out cloaks, shawls, and pelisses, the shrieks
of the frightened women, the weeping of the young ladies."
"I doubt
whether there was any theft, but it was no wonder that in such disorder
some went away without their wraps because they were unable to find
them, and this grew into a legend with many additions, long preserved in
the town."
"Lembke and Yulia Mihailovna were almost crushed by the crowd
at the doors."
"""Stop, every one!"
"Don't let anyone out!"""
"yelled Lembke, stretching out
his arms menacingly towards the crowding people."
"""Every one without exception to be strictly searched at once!"""
A storm of violent oaths rose from the crowd.
"""Andrey Antonovitch!"
"Andrey Antonovitch!"""
"cried Yulia Mihailovna in
complete despair."
"""Arrest her first!"""
"shouted her husband, pointing his finger at her
threateningly."
"""Search her first!"
"The ball was arranged with a view to
the fire....""

She screamed and fell into a swoon."
"(Oh, there was no doubt of its being
a real one.)"
"The general, the prince, and I rushed to her assistance;
there were others, even among the ladies, who helped us at that
difficult moment."
"We carried the unhappy woman out of this hell to her
carriage, but she only regained consciousness as she reached the house,
and her first utterance was about Andrey Antonovitch again."
"With the
destruction of all her fancies, the only thing left in her mind was
Andrey Antonovitch."
They sent for a doctor.
"I remained with her for a
whole hour; the prince did so too."
"The general, in an access of generous
feeling (though he had been terribly scared), meant to remain all night
""by the bedside of the unhappy lady,"" but within ten minutes he fell
asleep in an arm-chair in the drawing-room while waiting for the doctor,
and there we left him."
"The chief of the police, who had hurried from the ball to the fire, had
succeeded in getting Andrey Antonovitch out of the hall after us, and
attempted to put him into Yulia Mihailovna's carriage, trying all he
could to persuade his Excellency ""to seek repose."""
"But I don't know
why he did not insist."
"Andrey Antonovitch, of course, would not hear of
repose, and was set on going to the fire; but that was not a sufficient
reason."
It ended in his taking him to the fire in his droshky.
"He told
us afterwards that Lembke was gesticulating all the way and ""shouting
orders that it was impossible to obey owing to their unusualness."""
"It
was officially reported later on that his Excellency had at that time
been in a delirious condition ""owing to a sudden fright."""
There is no need to describe how the ball ended.
"A few dozen rowdy
fellows, and with them some ladies, remained in the hall."
"There were
no police present."
"They would not let the orchestra go, and beat
the musicians who attempted to leave."
"By morning they had pulled all
Prohoritch's stall to pieces, had drunk themselves senseless, danced the
Kamarinsky in its unexpurgated form, made the rooms in a shocking mess,
and only towards daybreak part of this hopelessly drunken rabble reached
the scene of the fire to make fresh disturbances there."
"The other part
spent the night in the rooms dead drunk, with disastrous consequences
to the velvet sofas and the floor."
"Next morning, at the earliest
possibility, they were dragged out by their legs into the street."
"So
ended the fête for the benefit of the governesses of our province."
"IV

The fire frightened the inhabitants of the riverside just because it
was evidently a case of arson."
"It was curious that at the first cry of
""fire"" another cry was raised that the Shpigulin men had done it."
"It
is now well known that three Shpigulin men really did have a share in
setting fire to the town, but that was all; all the other factory
hands were completely acquitted, not only officially but also by public
opinion."
"Besides those three rascals (of whom one has been caught and
confessed and the other two have so far escaped), Fedka the convict
undoubtedly had a hand in the arson."
"That is all that is known for
certain about the fire till now; but when it comes to conjectures it's
a very different matter."
What had led these three rascals to do it?
"Had
they been instigated by anyone?"
"It is very difficult to answer all these
questions even now."
"Owing to the strong wind, the fact that the houses at the riverside were
almost all wooden, and that they had been set fire to in three
places, the fire spread quickly and enveloped the whole quarter with
extraordinary rapidity."
"(The fire burnt, however, only at two ends;
at the third spot it was extinguished almost as soon as it began to
burn--of which later.)"
"But the Petersburg and Moscow papers exaggerated
our calamity."
"Not more than a quarter, roughly speaking, of the
riverside district was burnt down; possibly less indeed."
"Our fire
brigade, though it was hardly adequate to the size and population of the
town, worked with great promptitude and devotion."
"But it would not
have been of much avail, even with the zealous co-operation of the
inhabitants, if the wind had not suddenly dropped towards morning."
"When
an hour after our flight from the ball I made my way to the riverside,
the fire was at its height."
"A whole street parallel with the river was
in flames."
It was as light as day.
"I won't describe the fire; every one
in Russia knows what it looks like."
"The bustle and crush was immense in
the lanes adjoining the burning street."
"The inhabitants, fully expecting
the fire to reach their houses, were hauling out their belongings, but
had not yet left their dwellings, and were waiting meanwhile sitting
on their boxes and feather beds under their windows."
"Part of the male
population were hard at work ruthlessly chopping down fences and even
whole huts which were near the fire and on the windward side."
"None
were crying except the children, who had been waked out of their sleep,
though the women who had dragged out their chattels were lamenting
in sing-song voices."
"Those who had not finished their task were still
silent, busily carrying out their goods."
"Sparks and embers were carried
a long way in all directions."
People put them out as best they could.
"Some helped to put the fire out while others stood about, admiring it."
"A
great fire at night always has a thrilling and exhilarating effect."
This is what explains the attraction of fireworks.
"But in that case the
artistic regularity with which the fire is presented and the complete
lack of danger give an impression of lightness and playfulness like the
effect of a glass of champagne."
"A real conflagration is a very different
matter."
"Then the horror and a certain sense of personal danger,
together with the exhilarating effect of a fire at night, produce on the
spectator (though of course not in the householder whose goods are being
burnt) a certain concussion of the brain and, as it were, a challenge to
those destructive instincts which, alas, lie hidden in every heart, even
that of the mildest and most domestic little clerk...."
"This sinister
sensation is almost always fascinating."
"""I really don't know whether one
can look at a fire without a certain pleasure."""
"This is word for word
what Stepan Trofimovitch said to me one night on returning home after he
had happened to witness a fire and was still under the influence of the
spectacle."
"Of course, the very man who enjoys the spectacle will rush
into the fire himself to save a child or an old woman; but that is
altogether a different matter."
"Following in the wake of the crowd of sightseers, I succeeded, without
asking questions, in reaching the chief centre of danger, where at last
I saw Lembke, whom I was seeking at Yulia Mihailovna's request."
"His
position was strange and extraordinary."
"He was standing on the ruins of
a fence."
"Thirty paces to the left of him rose the black skeleton of a
two-storied house which had almost burnt out."
"It had holes instead of
windows at each story, its roof had fallen in, and the flames were still
here and there creeping among the charred beams."
"At the farther end
of the courtyard, twenty paces away, the lodge, also a two-storied
building, was beginning to burn, and the firemen were doing their utmost
to save it."
"On the right the firemen and the people were trying to save
a rather large wooden building which was not actually burning, though
it had caught fire several times and was inevitably bound to be burnt in
the end."
"Lembke stood facing the lodge, shouting and gesticulating."
"He
was giving orders which no one attempted to carry out."
"It seemed to me
that every one had given him up as hopeless and left him."
"Anyway,
though every one in the vast crowd of all classes, among whom there
were gentlemen, and even the cathedral priest, was listening to him
with curiosity and wonder, no one spoke to him or tried to get him away."
"Lembke, with a pale face and glittering eyes, was uttering the most
amazing things."
"To complete the picture, he had lost his hat and was
bareheaded."
"""It's all incendiarism!"
It's nihilism!
"If anything is burning, it's
nihilism!"""
"I heard almost with horror; and though there was nothing to
be surprised at, yet actual madness, when one sees it, always gives one
a shock."
"""Your Excellency,"" said a policeman, coming up to him, ""what if you were
to try the repose of home?..."
"It's dangerous for your Excellency even to
stand here."""
"This policeman, as I heard afterwards, had been told off by the chief
of police to watch over Andrey Antonovitch, to do his utmost to get him
home, and in case of danger even to use force--a task evidently beyond
the man's power."
"""They will wipe away the tears of the people whose houses have been
burnt, but they will burn down the town."
"It's all the work of four
scoundrels, four and a half!"
Arrest the scoundrel!
"He worms himself into
the honour of families."
"They made use of the governesses to burn down
the houses."
"It's vile, vile!"
"Aie, what's he about?"""
"he shouted, suddenly
noticing a fireman at the top of the burning lodge, under whom the roof
had almost burnt away and round whom the flames were beginning to flare
up."
"""Pull him down!"
Pull him down!
"He will fall, he will catch fire, put
him out!..."
"What is he doing there?"""
"""He is putting the fire out, your Excellency."""
"""Not likely."
"The fire is in the minds of men and not in the roofs of
houses."
Pull him down and give it up!
"Better give it up, much better!"
Let it put itself out.
"Aie, who is crying now?"
An old woman!
"It's an old
woman shouting."
"Why have they forgotten the old woman?"""
"There actually was an old woman crying on the ground floor of the
burning lodge."
"She was an old creature of eighty, a relation of the
shopkeeper who owned the house."
"But she had not been forgotten; she had
gone back to the burning house while it was still possible, with the
insane idea of rescuing her feather bed from a corner room which was
still untouched."
"Choking with the smoke and screaming with the heat, for
the room was on fire by the time she reached it, she was still trying
with her decrepit hands to squeeze her feather bed through a broken
window pane."
Lembke rushed to her assistance.
"Every one saw him run up
to the window, catch hold of one corner of the feather bed and try with
all his might to pull it out."
"As ill luck would have it, a board fell at
that moment from the roof and hit the unhappy governor."
"It did not
kill him, it merely grazed him on the neck as it fell, but Andrey
Antonovitch's career was over, among us at least; the blow knocked him
off his feet and he sank on the ground unconscious."
"The day dawned at last, gloomy and sullen."
"The fire was abating; the
wind was followed by a sudden calm, and then a fine drizzling rain fell."
"I was by that time in another part, some distance from where Lembke had
fallen, and here I overheard very strange conversations in the crowd."
"A
strange fact had come to light."
"On the very outskirts of the quarter,
on a piece of waste land beyond the kitchen gardens, not less than fifty
paces from any other buildings, there stood a little wooden house which
had only lately been built, and this solitary house had been on fire at
the very beginning, almost before any other."
"Even had it burnt down, it
was so far from other houses that no other building in the town could
have caught fire from it, and, vice versa, if the whole riverside
had been burnt to the ground, that house might have remained intact,
whatever the wind had been."
"It followed that it had caught fire
separately and independently and therefore not accidentally."
"But the
chief point was that it was not burnt to the ground, and at daybreak
strange things were discovered within it."
"The owner of this new house,
who lived in the neighbourhood, rushed up as soon as he saw it in flames
and with the help of his neighbours pulled apart a pile of faggots which
had been heaped up by the side wall and set fire to."
"In this way he
saved the house."
"But there were lodgers in the house--the captain, who
was well known in the town, his sister, and their elderly servant, and
these three persons--the captain, his sister, and their servant--had
been murdered and apparently robbed in the night."
"(It was here that the
chief of police had gone while Lembke was rescuing the feather bed.)"
"By morning the news had spread and an immense crowd of all classes, even
the riverside people who had been burnt out had flocked to the waste
land where the new house stood."
"It was difficult to get there, so dense
was the crowd."
"I was told at once that the captain had been found lying
dressed on the bench with his throat cut, and that he must have been
dead drunk when he was killed, so that he had felt nothing, and he had
""bled like a bull""; that his sister Marya Timofeyevna had been ""stabbed
all over"" with a knife and she was lying on the floor in the doorway, so
that probably she had been awake and had fought and struggled with the
murderer."
"The servant, who had also probably been awake, had her skull
broken."
"The owner of the house said that the captain had come to see him
the morning before, and that in his drunken bragging he had shown him a
lot of money, as much as two hundred roubles."
"The captain's shabby old
green pocket-book was found empty on the floor, but Marya Timofeyevna's
box had not been touched, and the silver setting of the ikon had not
been removed either; the captain's clothes, too, had not been disturbed."
"It was evident that the thief had been in a hurry and was a man familiar
with the captain's circumstances, who had come only for money and knew
where it was kept."
"If the owner of the house had not run up at that
moment the burning faggot stack would certainly have set fire to the
house and ""it would have been difficult to find out from the charred
corpses how they had died."""
So the story was told.
"One other fact was added: that the person who
had taken this house for the Lebyadkins was no other than Mr. Stavrogin,
Nikolay Vsyevolodovitch, the son of Varvara Petrovna."
"He had come
himself to take it and had had much ado to persuade the owner to let
it, as the latter had intended to use it as a tavern; but Nikolay
Vsyevolodovitch was ready to give any rent he asked and had paid for six
months in advance."
"""The fire wasn't an accident,"" I heard said in the crowd."
But the majority said nothing.
"People's faces were sullen, but I did
not see signs of much indignation."
"People persisted, however, in
gossiping about Stavrogin, saying that the murdered woman was his wife;
that on the previous day he had ""dishonourably"" abducted a young lady
belonging to the best family in the place, the daughter of Madame
Drozdov, and that a complaint was to be lodged against him in
Petersburg; and that his wife had been murdered evidently that he might
marry the young lady."
"Skvoreshniki was not more than a mile and a half
away, and I remember I wondered whether I should not let them know the
position of affairs."
"I did not notice, however, that there was anyone
egging the crowd on and I don't want to accuse people falsely, though I
did see and recognised at once in the crowd at the fire two or three
of the rowdy lot I had seen in the refreshment-room."
"I particularly
remember one thin, tall fellow, a cabinet-maker, as I found out later,
with an emaciated face and a curly head, black as though grimed with
soot."
"He was not drunk, but in contrast to the gloomy passivity of the
crowd seemed beside himself with excitement."
"He kept addressing the
people, though I don't remember his words; nothing coherent that he said
was longer than ""I say, lads, what do you say to this?"
"Are things to go
on like this?"""
and so saying he waved his arms.
CHAPTER III.
"A ROMANCE ENDED


I

FROM THE LARGE BALLROOM of Skvoreshniki (the room in which the last
interview with Varvara Petrovna and Stepan Trofimovitch had taken place)
the fire could be plainly seen."
"At daybreak, soon after five in the
morning, Liza was standing at the farthest window on the right looking
intently at the fading glow."
She was alone in the room.
"She was wearing
the dress she had worn the day before at the matinée--a very smart light
green dress covered with lace, but crushed and put on carelessly and
with haste."
"Suddenly noticing that some of the hooks were undone in
front she flushed, hurriedly set it right, snatched up from a chair the
red shawl she had flung down when she came in the day before, and put
it round her neck."
"Some locks of her luxuriant hair had come loose and
showed below the shawl on her right shoulder."
"Her face looked weary and
careworn, but her eyes glowed under her frowning brows."
"She went up to
the window again and pressed her burning forehead against the cold pane."
The door opened and Nikolay Vsyevolodovitch came in.
"""I've sent a messenger on horseback,"" he said."
"""In ten minutes we shall
hear all about it, meantime the servants say that part of the riverside
quarter has been burnt down, on the right side of the bridge near the
quay."
"It's been burning since eleven o'clock; now the fire is going
down."""
"He did not go near the window, but stood three steps behind her; she did
not turn towards him."
"""It ought to have been light an hour ago by the calendar, and it's still
almost night,"" she said irritably."
"""'Calendars always tell lies,'"" he observed with a polite smile, but,
a little ashamed; he made haste to add: ""It's dull to live by the
calendar, Liza."""
"And he relapsed into silence, vexed at the ineptitude of the second
sentence."
Liza gave a wry smile.
"""You are in such a melancholy mood that you cannot even find words to
speak to me."
"But you need not trouble, there's a point in what you said."
I always live by the calendar.
"Every step I take is regulated by the
calendar."
"Does that surprise you?"""
She turned quickly from the window and sat down in a low chair.
"""You sit down, too, please."
"We haven't long to be together and I want to
say anything I like.... Why shouldn't you, too, say anything you like?"""
"Nikolay Vsyevolodovitch sat beside her and softly, almost timidly took
her hand."
"""What's the meaning of this tone, Liza?"
"Where has it suddenly sprung
from?"
What do you mean by 'we haven't long to be together'?
"That's the
second mysterious phrase since you waked, half an hour ago."""
"""You are beginning to reckon up my mysterious phrases!"""
she laughed.
"""Do you remember I told you I was a dead woman when I came in yesterday?"
That you thought fit to forget.
"To forget or not to notice."""
"""I don't remember, Liza."
Why dead?
"You must live."""
"""And is that all?"
You've quite lost your flow of words.
"I've lived my
hour and that's enough."
"Do you remember Christopher Ivanovitch?"""
"""No I don't,"" he answered, frowning."
"""Christopher Ivanovitch at Lausanne?"
He bored you dreadfully.
"He always
used to open the door and say, 'I've come for one minute,' and then stay
the whole day."
"I don't want to be like Christopher Ivanovitch and stay
the whole day."""
A look of pain came into his face.
"""Liza, it grieves me, this unnatural language."
"This affectation must
hurt you, too."
What's it for?
"What's the object of it?"""
His eyes glowed.
"""Liza,"" he cried, ""I swear I love you now more than yesterday when you
came to me!"""
"""What a strange declaration!"
"Why bring in yesterday and to-day and these
comparisons?"""
"""You won't leave me,"" he went on, almost with despair; ""we will go away
together, to-day, won't we?"
"Won't we?"""
"""Aie, don't squeeze my hand so painfully!"
"Where could we go together
to-day?"
To 'rise again' somewhere?
"No, we've made experiments enough...
and it's too slow for me; and I am not fit for it; it's too exalted
for me."
"If we are to go, let it be to Moscow, to pay visits and
entertain--that's my ideal you know; even in Switzerland I didn't
disguise from you what I was like."
"As we can't go to Moscow and pay
visits since you are married, it's no use talking of that."""
"""Liza!"
"What happened yesterday!"""
"""What happened is over!"""
"""That's impossible!"
"That's cruel!"""
"""What if it is cruel?"
"You must bear it if it is cruel."""
"""You are avenging yourself on me for yesterday's caprice,"" he muttered
with an angry smile."
Liza flushed.
"""What a mean thought!"""
"""Why then did you bestow on me... so great a happiness?"
"Have I the right
to know?"""
"""No, you must manage without rights; don't aggravate the meanness of
your supposition by stupidity."
You are not lucky to-day.
"By the way, you
surely can't be afraid of public opinion and that you will be blamed
for this 'great happiness'?"
"If that's it, for God's sake don't alarm
yourself."
"It's not your doing at all and you are not responsible to
anyone."
"When I opened your door yesterday, you didn't even know who was
coming in."
"It was simply my caprice, as you expressed it just now,
and nothing more!"
"You can look every one in the face boldly and
triumphantly!"""
"""Your words, that laugh, have been making me feel cold with horror for
the last hour."
"That 'happiness' of which you speak frantically is
worth... everything to me."
How can I lose you now?
"I swear I loved you
less yesterday."
Why are you taking everything from me to-day?
"Do you
know what it has cost me, this new hope?"
"I've paid for it with life."""
"""Your own life or another's?"""
He got up quickly.
"""What does that mean?"""
"he brought out, looking at her steadily."
"""Have you paid for it with your life or with mine?"
is what I mean.
"Or
have you lost all power of understanding?"""
"cried Liza, flushing."
"""Why
did you start up so suddenly?"
Why do you stare at me with such a look?
You frighten me.
What is it you are afraid of all the time?
"I noticed
some time ago that you were afraid and you are now, this very minute...
Good heavens, how pale you are!"""
"""If you know anything, Liza, I swear I don't... and I wasn't talking of
_that_ just now when I said that I had paid for it with life....""

""I don't understand you,"" she brought out, faltering apprehensively."
At last a slow brooding smile came on to his lips.
"He slowly sat down,
put his elbows on his knees, and covered his face with his hands."
"""A bad dream and delirium.... We were talking of two different things."""
"""I don't know what you were talking about.... Do you mean to say you did
not know yesterday that I should leave you to-day, did you know or not?"
"Don't tell a lie, did you or not?"""
"""I did,"" he said softly."
"""Well then, what would you have?"
"You knew and yet you accepted 'that
moment' for yourself."
"Aren't we quits?"""
"""Tell me the whole truth,"" he cried in intense distress."
"""When you
opened my door yesterday, did you know yourself that it was only for one
hour?"""
She looked at him with hatred.
"""Really, the most sensible person can ask most amazing questions."
"And
why are you so uneasy?"
"Can it be vanity that a woman should leave you
first instead of your leaving her?"
"Do you know, Nikolay Vsyevolodovitch,
since I've been with you I've discovered that you are very generous to
me, and it's just that I can't endure from you."""
He got up from his seat and took a few steps about the room.
"""Very well, perhaps it was bound to end so...."
"But how can it all have
happened?"""
"""That's a question to worry about!"
"Especially as you know the answer
yourself perfectly well, and understand it better than anyone on earth,
and were counting on it yourself."
"I am a young lady, my heart has been
trained on the opera, that's how it all began, that's the solution."""
"""No."""
"""There is nothing in it to fret your vanity."
"It is all the absolute
truth."
It began with a fine moment which was too much for me to bear.
"The day before yesterday, when I 'insulted' you before every one and you
answered me so chivalrously, I went home and guessed at once that
you were running away from me because you were married, and not from
contempt for me which, as a fashionable young lady, I dreaded more than
anything."
"I understood that it was for my sake, for me, mad as I was,
that you ran away."
You see how I appreciate your generosity.
"Then Pyotr
Stepanovitch skipped up to me and explained it all to me at once."
"He
revealed to me that you were dominated by a 'great idea,' before which
he and I were as nothing, but yet that I was a stumbling-block in your
path."
"He brought himself in, he insisted that we three should work
together, and said the most fantastic things about a boat and about
maple-wood oars out of some Russian song."
"I complimented him and told
him he was a poet, which he swallowed as the real thing."
"And as apart
from him I had known long before that I had not the strength to do
anything for long, I made up my mind on the spot."
"Well, that's all and
quite enough, and please let us have no more explanations."
"We might
quarrel."
"Don't be afraid of anyone, I take it all on myself."
"I am horrid
and capricious, I was fascinated by that operatic boat, I am a young
lady... but you know I did think that you were dreadfully in love
with me."
"Don't despise the poor fool, and don't laugh at the tear that
dropped just now."
I am awfully given to crying with self-pity.
"Come,
that's enough, that's enough."
"I am no good for anything and you are
no good for anything; it's as bad for both of us, so let's comfort
ourselves with that."
"Anyway, it eases our vanity."""
"""Dream and delirium,"" cried Stavrogin, wringing his hands, and pacing
about the room."
"""Liza, poor child, what have you done to yourself?"""
"""I've burnt myself in a candle, nothing more."
"Surely you are not crying,
too?"
"You should show less feeling and better breeding....""

""Why, why did you come to me?"""
"""Don't you understand what a ludicrous position you put yourself in in
the eyes of the world by asking such questions?"""
"""Why have you ruined yourself, so grotesquely and so stupidly, and
what's to be done now?"""
"""And this is Stavrogin, 'the vampire Stavrogin,' as you are called by a
lady here who is in love with you!"
Listen!
"I have told you already, I've
put all my life into one hour and I am at peace."
"Do the same with
yours... though you've no need to: you have plenty of 'hours' and
'moments' of all sorts before you."""
"""As many as you; I give you my solemn word, not one hour more than you!"""
"He was still walking up and down and did not see the rapid penetrating
glance she turned upon him, in which there seemed a dawning hope."
"But
the light died away at the same moment."
"""If you knew what it costs me that I can't be sincere at this moment,
Liza, if I could only tell you...""

""Tell me?"
"You want to tell me something, to me?"
"God save me from your
secrets!"""
she broke in almost in terror.
He stopped and waited uneasily.
"""I ought to confess that ever since those days in Switzerland I have
had a strong feeling that you have something awful, loathsome, some
bloodshed on your conscience... and yet something that would make you
look very ridiculous."
"Beware of telling me, if it's true: I shall laugh
you to scorn."
"I shall laugh at you for the rest of your life.... Aie,
you are turning pale again?"
"I won't, I won't, I'll go at once."""
"She
jumped up from her chair with a movement of disgust and contempt."
"""Torture me, punish me, vent your spite on me,"" he cried in despair."
"""You have the full right."
"I knew I did not love you and yet I ruined
you!"
"Yes, I accepted the moment for my own; I had a hope..."
"I've had
it a long time... my last hope...."
"I could not resist the radiance that
flooded my heart when you came in to me yesterday, of yourself, alone,
of your own accord."
"I suddenly believed.... Perhaps I have faith in it
still."""
"""I will repay such noble frankness by being as frank."
"I don't want to be
a Sister of Mercy for you."
"Perhaps I really may become a nurse unless I
happen appropriately to die to-day; but if I do I won't be your nurse,
though, of course, you need one as much as any crippled creature."
"I
always fancied that you would take me to some place where there was a
huge wicked spider, big as a man, and we should spend our lives looking
at it and being afraid of it."
That's how our love would spend itself.
"Appeal to Dashenka; she will go with you anywhere you like."""
"""Can't you help thinking of her even now?"""
"""Poor little spaniel!"
Give her my greetings.
"Does she know that even in
Switzerland you had fixed on her for your old age?"
What prudence!
"What
foresight!"
"Aie, who's that?"""
"At the farther end of the room a door opened a crack; a head was thrust
in and vanished again hurriedly."
"""Is that you, Alexey Yegorytch?"""
asked Stavrogin.
"""No, it's only I."""
Pyotr Stepanovitch thrust himself half in again.
"""How do you do, Lizaveta Nikolaevna?"
"Good morning, anyway."
"I guessed I
should find you both in this room."
"I have come for one moment literally,
Nikolay Vsyevolodovitch."
"I was anxious to have a couple of words with
you at all costs... absolutely necessary... only a few words!"""
Stavrogin moved towards him but turned back to Liza at the third step.
"""If you hear anything directly, Liza, let me tell you I am to blame for
it!"""
She started and looked at him in dismay; but he hurriedly went out.
"II

The room from which Pyotr Stepanovitch had peeped in was a large
oval vestibule."
"Alexey Yegorytch had been sitting there before Pyotr
Stepanovitch came in, but the latter sent him away."
"Stavrogin closed the
door after him and stood expectant."
"Pyotr Stepanovitch looked rapidly
and searchingly at him."
"""Well?"""
"""If you know already,"" said Pyotr Stepanovitch hurriedly, his eyes
looking as though they would dive into Stavrogin's soul, ""then, of
course, we are none of us to blame, above all not you, for it's such a
concatenation... such a coincidence of events... in brief, you can't be
legally implicated and I've rushed here to tell you so beforehand."""
"""Have they been burnt?"
"murdered?"""
"""Murdered but not burnt, that's the trouble, but I give you my word of
honour that it's not been my fault, however much you may suspect me,
eh?"
"Do you want the whole truth: you see the idea really did cross my
mind--you hinted it yourself, not seriously, but teasing me (for, of
course, you would not hint it seriously), but I couldn't bring myself
to it, and wouldn't bring myself to it for anything, not for a hundred
roubles--and what was there to be gained by it, I mean for me, for
me...."" (He was in desperate haste and his talk was like the clacking of a
rattle.)"
"""But what a coincidence of circumstances: I gave that drunken
fool Lebyadkin two hundred and thirty roubles of my own money (do you
hear, my own money, there wasn't a rouble of yours and, what's more, you
know it yourself) the day before yesterday, in the evening--do you hear,
not yesterday after the matinée, but the day before yesterday, make a
note of it: it's a very important coincidence for I did not know for
certain at that time whether Lizaveta Nikolaevna would come to you or
not; I gave my own money simply because you distinguished yourself by
taking it into your head to betray your secret to every one."
"Well, I
won't go into that... that's your affair... your chivalry, but I must
own I was amazed, it was a knock-down blow."
"And forasmuch as I was
exceeding weary of these tragic stories--and let me tell you, I talk
seriously though I do use Biblical language--as it was all upsetting
my plans in fact, I made up my mind at any cost, and without your
knowledge, to pack the Lebyadkins off to Petersburg, especially as he
was set on going himself."
"I made one mistake: I gave the money in your
name;--was it a mistake or not?"
"Perhaps it wasn't a mistake, eh?"
"Listen
now, listen how it has all turned out....""

In the heat of his talk he went close up to Stavrogin and took hold of
the revers of his coat (really, it may have been on purpose)."
"With a
violent movement Stavrogin struck him on the arm."
"""Come, what is it... give over... you'll break my arm... what matters
is the way things have turned out,"" he rattled on, not in the least
surprised at the blow."
"""I forked out the money in the evening on
condition that his sister and he should set off early next morning; I
trusted that rascal Liputin with the job of getting them into the train
and seeing them off."
"But that beast Liputin wanted to play his schoolboy
pranks on the public--perhaps you heard?"
At the matinée?
"Listen, listen:
they both got drunk, made up verses of which half are Liputin's; he
rigged Lebyadkin out in a dress-coat, assuring me meanwhile that he had
packed him off that morning, but he kept him shut somewhere in a back
room, till he thrust him on the platform at the matinée."
"But Lebyadkin
got drunk quickly and unexpectedly."
"Then came the scandalous scene you
know of, and then they got him home more dead than alive, and Liputin
filched away the two hundred roubles, leaving him only small change."
"But
it appears unluckily that already that morning Lebyadkin had taken that
two hundred roubles out of his pocket, boasted of it and shown it in
undesirable quarters."
"And as that was just what Fedka was expecting, and
as he had heard something at Kirillov's (do you remember, your hint?)"
"he
made up his mind to take advantage of it."
That's the whole truth.
"I
am glad, anyway, that Fedka did not find the money, the rascal was
reckoning on a thousand, you know!"
"He was in a hurry and seems to have
been frightened by the fire himself.... Would you believe it, that fire
came as a thunderbolt for me."
Devil only knows what to make of it!
"It is
taking things into their own hands.... You see, as I expect so much of
you I will hide nothing from you: I've long been hatching this idea of a
fire because it suits the national and popular taste; but I was keeping
it for a critical moment, for that precious time when we should all rise
up and... And they suddenly took it into their heads to do it, on their
own initiative, without orders, now at the very moment when we ought to
be lying low and keeping quiet!"
Such presumption!...
"The fact is, I've
not got to the bottom of it yet, they talk about two Shpigulin men, but
if there are any of _our_ fellows in it, if any one of them has had a hand
in it--so much the worse for him!"
"You see what comes of letting people
get ever so little out of hand!"
"No, this democratic rabble, with
its quintets, is a poor foundation; what we want is one magnificent,
despotic will, like an idol, resting on something fundamental and
external.... Then the quintets will cringe into obedience and be
obsequiously ready on occasion."
"But, anyway, though, they are all crying
out now that Stavrogin wanted his wife to be burnt and that that's what
caused the fire in the town, but...""

""Why, are they all saying that?"""
"""Well, not yet, and I must confess I have heard nothing of the sort, but
what one can do with people, especially when they've been burnt out!"
"_Vox
populi vox Dei_."
A stupid rumour is soon set going.
"But you really have
nothing to be afraid of."
"From the legal point of view you are all right,
and with your conscience also."
"For you didn't want it done, did you?"
"There's no clue, nothing but the coincidence...."
"The only thing is Fedka
may remember what you said that night at Kirillov's (and what made you
say it?)"
but that proves nothing and we shall stop Fedka's mouth.
"I
shall stop it to-day....""

""And weren't the bodies burnt at all?"""
"""Not a bit; that ruffian could not manage anything properly."
"But I am
glad, anyway, that you are so calm... for though you are not in any way
to blame, even in thought, but all the same.... And you must admit that
all this settles your difficulties capitally: you are suddenly free and
a widower and can marry a charming girl this minute with a lot of money,
who is already yours, into the bargain."
"See what can be done by crude,
simple coincidence--eh?"""
"""Are you threatening me, you fool?"""
"""Come, leave off, leave off!"
"Here you are, calling me a fool, and what
a tone to use!"
"You ought to be glad, yet you..."
"I rushed here on purpose
to let you know in good time...."
"Besides, how could I threaten you?"
As if I cared for what I could get by threats!
"I want you to help from
goodwill and not from fear."
You are the light and the sun....
"It's
I who am terribly afraid of you, not you of me!"
"I am not Mavriky
Nikolaevitch.... And only fancy, as I flew here in a racing droshky I
saw Mavriky Nikolaevitch by the fence at the farthest corner of your
garden... in his greatcoat, drenched through, he must have been sitting
there all night!"
Queer goings on!
"How mad people can be!"""
"""Mavriky Nikolaevitch?"
"Is that true?"""
"""Yes, yes."
He is sitting by the garden fence.
"About three hundred paces
from here, I think."
"I made haste to pass him, but he saw me."
"Didn't you
know?"
In that case I am glad I didn't forget to tell you.
"A man like
that is more dangerous than anyone if he happens to have a revolver
about him, and then the night, the sleet, or natural irritability--for
after all he is in a nice position, ha ha!"
What do you think?
"Why is he
sitting there?"""
"""He is waiting for Lizaveta Nikolaevna, of course."""
"""Well!"
Why should she go out to him?
"And... in such rain too... what a
fool!"""
"""She is just going out to him!"""
"""Eh!"
That's a piece of news!
So then...
"But listen, her position is
completely changed now."
What does she want with Mavriky now?
"You
are free, a widower, and can marry her to-morrow."
"She doesn't know
yet--leave it to me and I'll arrange it all for you."
Where is she?
"We
must relieve her mind too."""
"""Relieve her mind?"""
"""Rather!"
"Let's go."""
"""And do you suppose she won't guess what those dead bodies mean?"""
"said
Stavrogin, screwing up his eyes in a peculiar way."
"""Of course she won't,"" said Pyotr Stepanovitch with all the confidence
of a perfect simpleton, ""for legally... Ech, what a man you are!"
"What
if she did guess?"
"Women are so clever at shutting their eyes to such
things, you don't understand women!"
"Apart from it's being altogether
to her interest to marry you now, because there's no denying she's
disgraced herself; apart from that, I talked to her of 'the boat' and I
saw that one could affect her by it, so that shows you what the girl is
made of."
"Don't be uneasy, she will step over those dead bodies without
turning a hair--especially as you are not to blame for them; not in the
least, are you?"
"She will only keep them in reserve to use them against
you when you've been married two or three years."
"Every woman saves up
something of the sort out of her husband's past when she gets married,
but by that time... what may not happen in a year?"
"Ha ha!"""
"""If you've come in a racing droshky, take her to Mavriky Nikolaevitch
now."
"She said just now that she could not endure me and would leave me,
and she certainly will not accept my carriage."""
"""What!"
Can she really be leaving?
"How can this have come about?"""
"said
Pyotr Stepanovitch, staring stupidly at him."
"""She's guessed somehow during this night that I don't love her... which
she knew all along, indeed."""
"""But don't you love her?"""
"said Pyotr Stepanovitch, with an expression
of extreme surprise."
"""If so, why did you keep her when she came to you
yesterday, instead of telling her plainly like an honourable man that
you didn't care for her?"
"That was horribly shabby on your part; and how
mean you make me look in her eyes!"""
Stavrogin suddenly laughed.
"""I am laughing at my monkey,"" he explained at once."
"""Ah!"
"You saw that I was putting it on!"""
"cried Pyotr Stepanovitch,
laughing too, with great enjoyment."
"""I did it to amuse you!"
"Only fancy,
as soon as you came out to me I guessed from your face that you'd been
'unlucky.'"
"A complete fiasco, perhaps."
Eh?
There!
"I'll bet anything,""
he cried, almost gasping with delight, ""that you've been sitting side by
side in the drawing-room all night wasting your precious time discussing
something lofty and elevated...."
"There, forgive me, forgive me; it's not
my business."
I felt sure yesterday that it would all end in foolishness.
"I brought her to you simply to amuse you, and to show you that you
wouldn't have a dull time with me."
"I shall be of use to you a hundred
times in that way."
I always like pleasing people.
"If you don't want her
now, which was what I was reckoning on when I came, then...""

""So you brought her simply for my amusement?"""
"""Why, what else?"""
"""Not to make me kill my wife?"""
"""Come."
You've not killed her?
What a tragic fellow you are!
"""It's just the same; you killed her."""
"""I didn't kill her!"
"I tell you I had no hand in it.... You are beginning
to make me uneasy, though....""

""Go on."
"You said, 'if you don't want her now, then... '""

""Then, leave it to me, of course."
"I can quite easily marry her off to
Mavriky Nikolaevitch, though I didn't make him sit down by the fence."
Don't take that notion into your head.
"I am afraid of him, now."
"You talk
about my droshky, but I simply dashed by.... What if he has a revolver?"
It's a good thing I brought mine.
"Here it is."""
"He brought a revolver out
of his pocket, showed it, and hid it again at once."
"""I took it as I
was coming such a long way...."
"But I'll arrange all that for you in a
twinkling: her little heart is aching at this moment for Mavriky; it
should be, anyway.... And, do you know, I am really rather sorry for
her?"
"If I take her to Mavriky she will begin about you directly; she
will praise you to him and abuse him to his face."
"You know the heart of
woman!"
"There you are, laughing again!"
"I am awfully glad that you are so
cheerful now."
"Come, let's go."
"I'll begin with Mavriky right away, and
about them... those who've been murdered... hadn't we better keep quiet
now?"
"She'll hear later on, anyway."""
"""What will she hear?"
Who's been murdered?
"What were you saying about
Mavriky Nikolaevitch?"""
"said Liza, suddenly opening the door."
"""Ah!"
"You've been listening?"""
"""What were you saying just now about Mavriky Nikolaevitch?"
"Has he been
murdered?"""
"""Ah!"
Then you didn't hear?
"Don't distress yourself, Mavriky Nikolaevitch
is alive and well, and you can satisfy yourself of it in an instant,
for he is here by the wayside, by the garden fence... and I believe he's
been sitting there all night."
He is drenched through in his greatcoat!
"He saw me as I drove past."""
"""That's not true."
You said 'murdered.'...
"Who's been murdered?"""
"she
insisted with agonising mistrust."
"""The only people who have been murdered are my wife, her brother
Lebyadkin, and their servant,"" Stavrogin brought out firmly."
Liza trembled and turned terribly pale.
"""A strange brutal outrage, Lizaveta Nikolaevna."
"A simple case of
robbery,"" Pyotr Stepanovitch rattled off at once ""Simply robbery, under
cover of the fire."
"The crime was committed by Fedka the convict, and it
was all that fool Lebyadkin's fault for showing every one his
money...."
"I rushed here with the news... it fell on me like a
thunderbolt."
Stavrogin could hardly stand when I told him.
"We were
deliberating here whether to tell you at once or not?"""
"""Nikolay Vsyevolodovitch, is he telling the truth?"""
"Liza articulated
faintly."
"""No; it's false."""
"""False?"""
"said Pyotr Stepanovitch, starting."
"""What do you mean by that?"""
"""Heavens!"
"I shall go mad!"""
cried Liza.
"""Do you understand, anyway, that he is mad now!"""
"Pyotr Stepanovitch
cried at the top of his voice."
"""After all, his wife has just been
murdered."
"You see how white he is.... Why, he has been with you the
whole night."
He hasn't left your side a minute.
"How can you suspect
him?"""
"""Nikolay Vsyevolodovitch, tell me, as before God, are you guilty or not,
and I swear I'll believe your word as though it were God's, and I'll
follow you to the end of the earth."
"Yes, I will."
"I'll follow you like a
dog."""
"""Why are you tormenting her, you fantastic creature?"""
"cried Pyotr
Stepanovitch in exasperation."
"""Lizaveta Nikolaevna, upon my oath, you
can crush me into powder, but he is not guilty."
"On the contrary, it has
crushed him, and he is raving, you see that."
"He is not to blame in
any way, not in any way, not even in thought!..."
"It's all the work of
robbers who will probably be found within a week and flogged...."
"It's
all the work of Fedka the convict, and some Shpigulin men, all the town
is agog with it."
"That's why I say so too."""
"""Is that right?"
"Is that right?"""
"Liza waited trembling for her final
sentence."
"""I did not kill them, and I was against it, but I knew they were
going to be killed and I did not stop the murderers."
"Leave me, Liza,""
Stavrogin brought out, and he walked into the drawing-room."
Liza hid her face in her hands and walked out of the house.
"Pyotr
Stepanovitch was rushing after her, but at once hurried back and went
into the drawing-room."
"""So that's your line?"
That's your line?
"So there's nothing you are
afraid of?"""
"He flew at Stavrogin in an absolute fury, muttering
incoherently, scarcely able to find words and foaming at the mouth."
Stavrogin stood in the middle of the room and did not answer a word.
He clutched a lock of his hair in his left hand and smiled helplessly.
Pyotr Stepanovitch pulled him violently by the sleeve.
"""Is it all over with you?"
So that's the line you are taking?
"You'll
inform against all of us, and go to a monastery yourself, or to the
devil...."
"But I'll do for you, though you are not afraid of me!"""
"""Ah!"
"That's you chattering!"""
"said Stavrogin, noticing him at last."
"""Run,"" he said, coming to himself suddenly, ""run after her, order the
carriage, don't leave her.... Run, run!"
"Take her home so that no one
may know... and that she mayn't go there... to the bodies... to the
bodies.... Force her to get into the carriage... Alexey Yegorytch!"
"Alexey Yegorytch!"""
"""Stay, don't shout!"
"By now she is in Mavriky's arms.... Mavriky won't
put her into your carriage.... Stay!"
"There's something more important
than the carriage!"""
He seized his revolver again.
Stavrogin looked at him gravely.
"""Very well, kill me,"" he said softly, almost conciliatorily."
"""Foo."
Damn it!
"What a maze of false sentiment a man can get into!"""
"said
Pyotr Stepanovitch, shaking with rage."
"""Yes, really, you ought to be
killed!"
She ought simply to spit at you!
"Fine sort of 'magic boat,'
you are; you are a broken-down, leaky old hulk!..."
"You ought to pull
yourself together if only from spite!"
Ech!
"Why, what difference would it
make to you since you ask for a bullet through your brains yourself?"""
Stavrogin smiled strangely.
"""If you were not such a buffoon I might perhaps have said yes now...."
"If
you had only a grain of sense...""

""I am a buffoon, but I don't want you, my better half, to be one!"
"Do you
understand me?"""
"Stavrogin did understand, though perhaps no one else did."
"Shatov, for
instance, was astonished when Stavrogin told him that Pyotr Stepanovitch
had enthusiasm."
"""Go to the devil now, and to-morrow perhaps I may wring something out of
myself."
"Come to-morrow."""
"""Yes?"
"Yes?"""
"""How can I tell?..."
Go to hell.
"Go to hell."""
"And he walked out of the
room."
"""Perhaps, after all, it may be for the best,"" Pyotr Stepanovitch
muttered to himself as he hid the revolver."
"III

He rushed off to overtake Lizaveta Nikolaevna."
"She had not got far
away, only a few steps, from the house."
"She had been detained by Alexey
Yegorytch, who was following a step behind her, in a tail coat, and
without a hat; his head was bowed respectfully."
"He was persistently
entreating her to wait for a carriage; the old man was alarmed and
almost in tears."
"""Go along."
"Your master is asking for tea, and there's no one to give it
to him,"" said Pyotr Stepanovitch, pushing him away."
He took Liza's arm.
"She did not pull her arm away, but she seemed hardly to know what she
was doing; she was still dazed."
"""To begin with, you are going the wrong way,"" babbled Pyotr
Stepanovitch."
"""We ought to go this way, and not by the garden, and,
secondly, walking is impossible in any case."
"It's over two miles, and
you are not properly dressed."
"If you would wait a second, I came in a
droshky; the horse is in the yard."
"I'll get it instantly, put you in,
and get you home so that no one sees you."""
"""How kind you are,"" said Liza graciously."
"""Oh, not at all."
"Any humane man in my position would do the same....""

Liza looked at him, and was surprised."
"""Good heavens!"
"Why I thought it was that old man here still."""
"""Listen."
"I am awfully glad that you take it like this, because it's
all such a frightfully stupid convention, and since it's come to that,
hadn't I better tell the old man to get the carriage at once."
"It's only
a matter of ten minutes and we'll turn back and wait in the porch, eh?"""
"""I want first... where are those murdered people?"""
"""Ah!"
What next?
"That was what I was afraid of.... No, we'd better leave
those wretched creatures alone; it's no use your looking at them."""
"""I know where they are."
"I know that house."""
"""Well?"
What if you do know it?
"Come; it's raining, and there's a fog."
(A nice job this sacred duty I've taken upon myself.)
"Listen, Lizaveta
Nikolaevna!"
It's one of two alternatives.
"Either you come with me in the
droshky--in that case wait here, and don't take another step, for if we
go another twenty steps we must be seen by Mavriky Nikolaevitch."""
"""Mavriky Nikolaevitch!"
Where?
"Where?"""
"""Well, if you want to go with him, I'll take you a little farther, if
you like, and show you where he sits, but I don't care to go up to him
just now."
"No, thank you."""
"""He is waiting for me."
"Good God!"""
"she suddenly stopped, and a flush of
colour flooded her face."
"""Oh!"
Come now.
If he is an unconventional man!
"You know, Lizaveta
Nikolaevna, it's none of my business."
"I am a complete outsider, and you
know that yourself."
"But, still, I wish you well...."
"If your 'fairy boat'
has failed you, if it has turned out to be nothing more than a rotten
old hulk, only fit to be chopped up...""

""Ah!"
"That's fine, that's lovely,"" cried Liza."
"""Lovely, and yet your tears are falling."
You must have spirit.
"You must
be as good as a man in every way."
"In our age, when woman.... Foo, hang
it,"" Pyotr Stepanovitch was on the point of spitting."
"""And the chief
point is that there is nothing to regret."
"It may all turn out for the
best."
Mavriky Nikolaevitch is a man....
"In fact, he is a man of feeling
though not talkative, but that's a good thing, too, as long as he has no
conventional notions, of course....""

""Lovely, lovely!"""
Liza laughed hysterically.
"""Well, hang it all... Lizaveta Nikolaevna,"" said Pyotr Stepanovitch
suddenly piqued."
"""I am simply here on your account...."
"It's nothing to
me...."
I helped you yesterday when you wanted it yourself.
"To-day ...
well, you can see Mavriky Nikolaevitch from here; there he's sitting; he
doesn't see us."
"I say, Lizaveta Nikolaevna, have you ever read 'Polenka
Saxe'?"""
"""What's that?"""
"""It's the name of a novel, 'Polenka Saxe.'"
"I read it when I was a
student...."
"In it a very wealthy official of some sort, Saxe, arrested
his wife at a summer villa for infidelity...."
"But, hang it; it's no
consequence!"
"You'll see, Mavriky Nikolaevitch will make you an offer
before you get home."
"He doesn't see us yet."""
"""Ach!"
"Don't let him see us!"""
"Liza cried suddenly, like a mad creature."
"""Come away, come away!"
"To the woods, to the fields!"""
And she ran back.
"""Lizaveta Nikolaevna, this is such cowardice,"" cried Pyotr Stepanovitch,
running after her."
"""And why don't you want him to see you?"
"On the
contrary, you must look him straight in the face, with pride...."
"If it's
some feeling about that... some maidenly... that's such a prejudice, so
out of date..."
But where are you going?
Where are you going?
Ech!
"she is
running!"
"Better go back to Stavrogin's and take my droshky.... Where are
you going?"
That's the way to the fields!
There!
"She's fallen down!..."""
He stopped.
"Liza was flying along like a bird, not conscious where she
was going, and Pyotr Stepanovitch was already fifty paces behind her."
She stumbled over a mound of earth and fell down.
"At the same moment
there was the sound of a terrible shout from behind."
"It came from
Mavriky Nikolaevitch, who had seen her flight and her fall, and was
running to her across the field."
"In a flash Pyotr Stepanovitch had
retired into Stavrogin's gateway to make haste and get into his droshky."
"Mavriky Nikolaevitch was already standing in terrible alarm by Liza, who
had risen to her feet; he was bending over her and holding her hands in
both of his."
"All the incredible surroundings of this meeting overwhelmed
him, and tears were rolling down his cheeks."
"He saw the woman for whom
he had such reverent devotion running madly across the fields, at such
an hour, in such weather, with nothing over her dress, the gay dress she
wore the day before now crumpled and muddy from her fall...."
"He could
not utter a word; he took off his greatcoat, and with trembling hands
put it round her shoulders."
"Suddenly he uttered a cry, feeling that she
had pressed her lips to his hand."
"""Liza,"" he cried, ""I am no good for anything, but don't drive me away
from you!"""
"""Oh, no!"
Let us make haste away from here.
"Don't leave me!"""
"and, seizing
his hand, she drew him after her."
"""Mavriky Nikolaevitch,"" she suddenly
dropped her voice timidly, ""I kept a bold face there all the time, but
now I am afraid of death."
"I shall die soon, very soon, but I am afraid,
I am afraid to die...."" she whispered, pressing his hand tight."
"""Oh, if there were someone,"" he looked round in despair."
"""Some
passer-by!"
"You will get your feet wet, you... will lose your reason!"""
"""It's all right; it's all right,"" she tried to reassure him."
"""That's
right."
I am not so frightened with you.
"Hold my hand, lead me.... Where
are we going now?"
Home?
No!
"I want first to see the people who have been
murdered."
"His wife has been murdered they say, and he says he killed
her himself."
"But that's not true, is it?"
"I want to see for myself those
three who've been killed... on my account... it's because of them his
love for me has grown cold since last night...."
"I shall see and find out
everything."
"Make haste, make haste, I know the house... there's a fire
there.... Mavriky Nikolaevitch, my dear one, don't forgive me in my
shame!"
Why forgive me?
Why are you crying?
"Give me a blow and kill me
here in the field, like a dog!"""
"""No one is your judge now,"" Mavriky Nikolaevitch pronounced firmly."
"""God
forgive you."
"I least of all can be your judge."""
But it would be strange to describe their conversation.
"And meanwhile
they walked hand in hand quickly, hurrying as though they were crazy."
They were going straight towards the fire.
"Mavriky Nikolaevitch still
had hopes of meeting a cart at least, but no one came that way."
"A mist
of fine, drizzling rain enveloped the whole country, swallowing up every
ray of light, every gleam of colour, and transforming everything into
one smoky, leaden, indistinguishable mass."
"It had long been daylight,
yet it seemed as though it were still night."
"And suddenly in this cold
foggy mist there appeared coming towards them a strange and absurd
figure."
"Picturing it now I think I should not have believed my eyes if
I had been in Lizaveta Nikolaevna's place, yet she uttered a cry of
joy, and recognised the approaching figure at once."
"It was Stepan
Trofimovitch."
"How he had gone off, how the insane, impracticable idea
of his flight came to be carried out, of that later."
"I will only mention
that he was in a fever that morning, yet even illness did not prevent
his starting."
He was walking resolutely on the damp ground.
"It was
evident that he had planned the enterprise to the best of his ability,
alone with his inexperience and lack of practical sense."
"He wore
""travelling dress,"" that is, a greatcoat with a wide patent-leather
belt, fastened with a buckle and a pair of new high boots pulled over
his trousers."
"Probably he had for some time past pictured a traveller as
looking like this, and the belt and the high boots with the shining tops
like a hussar's, in which he could hardly walk, had been ready some time
before."
"A broad-brimmed hat, a knitted scarf, twisted close round his
neck, a stick in his right hand, and an exceedingly small but extremely
tightly packed bag in his left, completed his get-up."
"He had, besides,
in the same right hand, an open umbrella."
"These three objects--the
umbrella, the stick, and the bag--had been very awkward to carry for the
first mile, and had begun to be heavy by the second."
"""Can it really be you?"""
"cried Liza, looking at him with distressed
wonder, after her first rush of instinctive gladness."
"_""Lise,""_ cried Stepan Trofimovitch, rushing to her almost in delirium too."
"""_Chère, chère_.... Can you be out, too... in such a fog?"
"You see the glow
of fire."
"_Vous êtes malheureuse, n'est-ce pas?_ I see, I see."
"Don't tell
me, but don't question me either."
"_Nous sommes tous malheureux mais il
faut les pardonner tous."
"Pardonnons, Lise,_ and let us be free forever."
To be quit of the world and be completely free.
"_Il faut pardonner,
pardonner, et pardonner!"
"""_

""But why are you kneeling down?"""
"""Because, taking leave of the world, I want to take leave of all my past
in your person!"""
"He wept and raised both her hands to his tear-stained
eyes."
"""I kneel to all that was beautiful in my life."
"I kiss and give
thanks!"
"Now I've torn myself in half; left behind a mad visionary who
dreamed of soaring to the sky."
"_Vingt-deux ans,_ here."
"A shattered, frozen
old man."
"A tutor _chez ce marchand, s'il existe pourtant ce
marchand...._ But how drenched you are, _Lise!"
"""_ he cried, jumping on to
his feet, feeling that his knees too were soaked by the wet earth."
"""And
how is it possible... you are in such a dress... and on foot, and in
these fields?..."
You are crying!
"_Vous êtes malheureuse._ Bah, I did hear
something...."
"But where have you come from now?"""
"He asked hurried
questions with an uneasy air, looking in extreme bewilderment at Mavriky
Nikolaevitch."
"_""Mais savez-vous l'heure qu'il est?"
"""_

""Stepan Trofimovitch, have you heard anything about the people who've
been murdered?..."
Is it true?
"Is it true?"""
"""These people!"
I saw the glow of their work all night.
"They were bound
to end in this...."" His eyes flashed again."
"""I am fleeing away from
madness, from a delirious dream."
I am fleeing away to seek for Russia.
"_Existe-t-elle, la Russie?"
Bah!
"C'est vous, cher capitaine!_
I've never doubted that I should meet you somewhere on some high
adventure...."
"But take my umbrella, and--why must you be on foot?"
"For
God's sake, do at least take my umbrella, for I shall hire a carriage
somewhere in any case."
"I am on foot because Stasie (I mean, Nastasya)
would have shouted for the benefit of the whole street if she'd found out
I was going away."
So I slipped away as far as possible incognito.
"I don't
know; in the _Voice_ they write of there being brigands everywhere, but I
thought surely I shouldn't meet a brigand the moment I came out on the
road."
"_Chère Lise,_ I thought you said something of someone's being
murdered."
"_Oh, mon Dieu!_ You are ill!"""
"""Come along, come along!"""
"cried Liza, almost in hysterics, drawing
Mavriky Nikolaevitch after her again."
"""Wait a minute, Stepan
Trofimovitch!"""
she came back suddenly to him.
"""Stay, poor darling, let
me sign you with the cross."
"Perhaps, it would be better to put you under
control, but I'd rather make the sign of the cross over you."
"You, too,
pray for 'poor' Liza--just a little, don't bother too much about it."
"Mavriky Nikolaevitch, give that baby back his umbrella."
"You must give it
him."
"That's right.... Come, let us go, let us go!"""
"They reached the fatal house at the very moment when the huge crowd,
which had gathered round it, had already heard a good deal of Stavrogin,
and of how much it was to his interest to murder his wife."
"Yet, I
repeat, the immense majority went on listening without moving or
uttering a word."
"The only people who were excited were bawling drunkards
and excitable individuals of the same sort as the gesticulatory
cabinet-maker."
"Every one knew the latter as a man really of mild
disposition, but he was liable on occasion to get excited and to fly off
at a tangent if anything struck him in a certain way."
"I did not see
Liza and Mavriky Nikolaevitch arrive."
"Petrified with amazement, I first
noticed Liza some distance away in the crowd, and I did not at once
catch sight of Mavriky Nikolaevitch."
"I fancy there was a moment when
he fell two or three steps behind her or was pressed back by the crush."
"Liza, forcing her way through the crowd, seeing and noticing nothing
round her, like one in a delirium, like a patient escaped from a
hospital, attracted attention only too quickly, of course."
"There arose
a hubbub of loud talking and at last sudden shouts."
"Some one bawled out,
""It's Stavrogin's woman!"""
"And on the other side, ""It's not enough to
murder them, she wants to look at them!"""
"All at once I saw an arm raised
above her head from behind and suddenly brought down upon it."
"Liza fell
to the ground."
"We heard a fearful scream from Mavriky Nikolaevitch as
he dashed to her assistance and struck with all his strength the man who
stood between him and Liza."
"But at that instant the same cabinetmaker
seized him with both arms from behind."
"For some minutes nothing could be
distinguished in the scrimmage that followed."
"I believe Liza got up but
was knocked down by another blow."
"Suddenly the crowd parted and a
small space was left empty round Liza's prostrate figure, and Mavriky
Nikolaevitch, frantic with grief and covered with blood, was standing
over her, screaming, weeping, and wringing his hands."
"I don't remember
exactly what followed after; I only remember that they began to carry
Liza away."
I ran after her.
"She was still alive and perhaps still
conscious."
"The cabinet-maker and three other men in the crowd were
seized."
"These three still deny having taken any part in the dastardly
deed, stubbornly maintaining that they have been arrested by mistake."
Perhaps it's the truth.
"Though the evidence against the cabinet-maker
is clear, he is so irrational that he is still unable to explain what
happened coherently."
"I too, as a spectator, though at some distance,
had to give evidence at the inquest."
"I declared that it had all happened
entirely accidentally through the action of men perhaps moved by
ill-feeling, yet scarcely conscious of what they were doing--drunk and
irresponsible."
I am of that opinion to this day.
CHAPTER IV.
"THE LAST RESOLUTION


I

THAT MORNING MANY people saw Pyotr Stepanovitch."
"All who saw him
remembered that he was in a particularly excited state."
"At two o'clock
he went to see Gaganov, who had arrived from the country only the day
before, and whose house was full of visitors hotly discussing the events
of the previous day."
"Pyotr Stepanovitch talked more than anyone and made
them listen to him."
"He was always considered among us as a ""chatterbox
of a student with a screw loose,"" but now he talked of Yulia Mihailovna,
and in the general excitement the theme was an enthralling one."
"As one
who had recently been her intimate and confidential friend, he disclosed
many new and unexpected details concerning her; incidentally (and of
course unguardedly) he repeated some of her own remarks about persons
known to all in the town, and thereby piqued their vanity."
"He dropped
it all in a vague and rambling way, like a man free from guile driven
by his sense of honour to the painful necessity of clearing up a perfect
mountain of misunderstandings, and so simple-hearted that he hardly knew
where to begin and where to leave off."
"He let slip in a rather unguarded
way, too, that Yulia Mihailovna knew the whole secret of Stavrogin and
that she had been at the bottom of the whole intrigue."
"She had taken
him in too, for he, Pyotr Stepanovitch, had also been in love with this
unhappy Liza, yet he had been so hoodwinked that he had _almost_ taken her
to Stavrogin himself in the carriage."
"""Yes, yes, it's all very well
for you to laugh, gentlemen, but if only I'd known, if I'd known how it
would end!"""
he concluded.
"To various excited inquiries about Stavrogin
he bluntly replied that in his opinion the catastrophe to the Lebyadkins
was a pure coincidence, and that it was all Lebyadkin's own fault for
displaying his money."
He explained this particularly well.
"One of his
listeners observed that it was no good his ""pretending""; that he had
eaten and drunk and almost slept at Yulia Mihailovna's, yet now he was
the first to blacken her character, and that this was by no means such
a fine thing to do as he supposed."
"But Pyotr Stepanovitch immediately
defended himself."
"""I ate and drank there not because I had no money, and it's not my fault
that I was invited there."
"Allow me to judge for myself how far I need to
be grateful for that."""
The general impression was in his favour.
"""He may be rather absurd, and
of course he is a nonsensical fellow, yet still he is not responsible
for Yulia Mihailovna's foolishness."
"On the contrary, it appears that he
tried to stop her."""
"About two o'clock the news suddenly came that Stavrogin, about whom
there was so much talk, had suddenly left for Petersburg by the midday
train."
This interested people immensely; many of them frowned.
"Pyotr
Stepanovitch was so much struck that I was told he turned quite pale and
cried out strangely, ""Why, how could they have let him go?"""
"He hurried
away from Gaganov's forthwith, yet he was seen in two or three other
houses."
"Towards dusk he succeeded in getting in to see Yulia Mihailovna though
he had the greatest pains to do so, as she had absolutely refused to see
him."
"I heard of this from the lady herself only three weeks afterwards,
just before her departure for Petersburg."
"She gave me no details, but
observed with a shudder that ""he had on that occasion astounded her
beyond all belief."""
"I imagine that all he did was to terrify her
by threatening to charge her with being an accomplice if she ""said
anything."""
"The necessity for this intimidation arose from his plans at
the moment, of which she, of course, knew nothing; and only later,
five days afterwards, she guessed why he had been so doubtful of her
reticence and so afraid of a new outburst of indignation on her part."
"Between seven and eight o'clock, when it was dark, all the five members
of the quintet met together at Ensign Erkel's lodgings in a little
crooked house at the end of the town."
"The meeting had been fixed by
Pyotr Stepanovitch himself, but he was unpardonably late, and the
members waited over an hour for him."
"This Ensign Erkel was that young
officer who had sat the whole evening at Virginsky's with a pencil in
his hand and a notebook before him."
"He had not long been in the town;
he lodged alone with two old women, sisters, in a secluded by-street and
was shortly to leave the town; a meeting at his house was less likely
to attract notice than anywhere."
"This strange boy was distinguished by
extreme taciturnity: he was capable of sitting for a dozen evenings in
succession in noisy company, with the most extraordinary conversation
going on around him, without uttering a word, though he listened with
extreme attention, watching the speakers with his childlike eyes."
"His
face was very pretty and even had a certain look of cleverness."
"He did
not belong to the quintet; it was supposed that he had some special job
of a purely practical character."
"It is known now that he had nothing of
the sort and probably did not understand his position himself."
"It was
simply that he was filled with hero-worship for Pyotr Stepanovitch,
whom he had only lately met."
"If he had met a monster of iniquity who had
incited him to found a band of brigands on the pretext of some romantic
and socialistic object, and as a test had bidden him rob and murder the
first peasant he met, he would certainly have obeyed and done it."
"He had
an invalid mother to whom he sent half of his scanty pay--and how
she must have kissed that poor little flaxen head, how she must have
trembled and prayed over it!"
"I go into these details about him because I
feel very sorry for him."
"""Our fellows"" were excited."
"The events of the previous night had made a
great impression on them, and I fancy they were in a panic."
"The simple
disorderliness in which they had so zealously and systematically taken
part had ended in a way they had not expected."
"The fire in the night,
the murder of the Lebyadkins, the savage brutality of the crowd with
Liza, had been a series of surprises which they had not anticipated in
their programme."
"They hotly accused the hand that had guided them of
despotism and duplicity."
"In fact, while they were waiting for Pyotr
Stepanovitch they worked each other up to such a point that they
resolved again to ask him for a definite explanation, and if he evaded
again, as he had done before, to dissolve the quintet and to found
instead a new secret society ""for the propaganda of ideas"" and on
their own initiative on the basis of democracy and equality."
"Liputin,
Shigalov, and the authority on the peasantry supported this plan;
Lyamshin said nothing, though he looked approving."
"Virginsky hesitated
and wanted to hear Pyotr Stepanovitch first."
"It was decided to hear
Pyotr Stepanovitch, but still he did not come; such casualness added
fuel to the flames."
"Erkel was absolutely silent and did nothing but
order the tea, which he brought from his landladies in glasses on a
tray, not bringing in the samovar nor allowing the servant to enter."
Pyotr Stepanovitch did not turn up till half-past eight.
"With rapid
steps he went up to the circular table before the sofa round which the
company were seated; he kept his cap in his hand and refused tea."
"He
looked angry, severe, and supercilious."
"He must have observed at once
from their faces that they were ""mutinous."""
"""Before I open my mouth, you've got something hidden; out with it."""
"Liputin began ""in the name of all,"" and declared in a voice quivering
with resentment ""that if things were going on like that they might as
well blow their brains out."""
"Oh, they were not at all afraid to blow
their brains out, they were quite ready to, in fact, but only to serve
the common cause (a general movement of approbation)."
"So he must be more
open with them so that they might always know beforehand, ""or else what
would things be coming to?"""
(Again a stir and some guttural sounds.)
"To
behave like this was humiliating and dangerous."
"""We don't say so because
we are afraid, but if one acts and the rest are only pawns, then one
would blunder and all would be lost."""
(Exclamations.
"""Yes, yes."""
"General
approval.)"
"""Damn it all, what do you want?"""
"""What connection is there between the common cause and the petty
intrigues of Mr."
"Stavrogin?"""
"cried Liputin, boiling over."
"""Suppose he
is in some mysterious relation to the centre, if that legendary centre
really exists at all, it's no concern of ours."
"And meantime a murder has
been committed, the police have been roused; if they follow the thread
they may find what it starts from."""
"""If Stavrogin and you are caught, we shall be caught too,"" added the
authority on the peasantry."
"""And to no good purpose for the common cause,"" Virginsky concluded
despondently."
"""What nonsense!"
"The murder is a chance crime; it was committed by Fedka
for the sake of robbery."""
"""H'm!"
"Strange coincidence, though,"" said Liputin, wriggling."
"""And if you will have it, it's all through you."""
"""Through us?"""
"""In the first place, you, Liputin, had a share in the intrigue yourself;
and the second chief point is, you were ordered to get Lebyadkin away
and given money to do it; and what did you do?"
"If you'd got him away
nothing would have happened."""
"""But wasn't it you yourself who suggested the idea that it would be a
good thing to set him on to read his verses?"""
"""An idea is not a command."
"The command was to get him away."""
"""Command!"
"Rather a queer word.... On the contrary, your orders were to
delay sending him off."""
"""You made a mistake and showed your foolishness and self-will."
"The
murder was the work of Fedka, and he carried it out alone for the sake
of robbery."
You heard the gossip and believed it.
You were scared.
"Stavrogin is not such a fool, and the proof of that is he left the town
at twelve o'clock after an interview with the vice-governor; if there
were anything in it they would not let him go to Petersburg in broad
daylight."""
"""But we are not making out that Mr. Stavrogin committed the murder
himself,"" Liputin rejoined spitefully and unceremoniously."
"""He may have
known nothing about it, like me; and you know very well that I knew
nothing about it, though I am mixed up in it like mutton in a hash."""
"""Whom are you accusing?"""
"said Pyotr Stepanovitch, looking at him darkly."
"""Those whose interest it is to burn down towns."""
"""You make matters worse by wriggling out of it."
"However, won't you read
this and pass it to the others, simply as a fact of interest?"""
"He pulled out of his pocket Lebyadkin's anonymous letter to Lembke and
handed it to Liputin."
"The latter read it, was evidently surprised, and
passed it thoughtfully to his neighbour; the letter quickly went the
round."
"""Is that really Lebyadkin's handwriting?"""
observed Shigalov.
"""It is,"" answered Liputin and Tolkatchenko (the authority on the
peasantry)."
"""I simply brought it as a fact of interest and because I knew you were
so sentimental over Lebyadkin,"" repeated Pyotr Stepanovitch, taking the
letter back."
"""So it turns out, gentlemen, that a stray Fedka relieves us
quite by chance of a dangerous man."
That's what chance does sometimes!
"It's instructive, isn't it?"""
The members exchanged rapid glances.
"""And now, gentlemen, it's my turn to ask questions,"" said Pyotr
Stepanovitch, assuming an air of dignity."
"""Let me know what business you
had to set fire to the town without permission."""
"""What's this!"
"We, we set fire to the town?"
"That is laying the blame on
others!"""
they exclaimed.
"""I quite understand that you carried the game too far,"" Pyotr
Stepanovitch persisted stubbornly, ""but it's not a matter of petty
scandals with Yulia Mihailovna."
"I've brought you here gentlemen,
to explain to you the greatness of the danger you have so stupidly
incurred, which is a menace to much besides yourselves."""
"""Excuse me, we, on the contrary, were intending just now to point out
to you the greatness of the despotism and unfairness you have shown
in taking such a serious and also strange step without consulting the
members,"" Virginsky, who had been hitherto silent, protested, almost
with indignation."
"""And so you deny it?"
"But I maintain that you set fire to the town, you
and none but you."
"Gentlemen, don't tell lies!"
I have good evidence.
"By
your rashness you exposed the common cause to danger."
"You are only one
knot in an endless network of knots--and your duty is blind obedience to
the centre."
"Yet three men of you incited the Shpigulin men to set fire
to the town without the least instruction to do so, and the fire has
taken place."""
"""What three?"
"What three of us?"""
"""The day before yesterday, at three o'clock in the night, you,
Tolkatchenko, were inciting Fomka Zavyalov at the 'Forget-me-not.'"""
"""Upon my word!"""
"cried the latter, jumping up, ""I scarcely said a word
to him, and what I did say was without intention, simply because he had
been flogged that morning."
"And I dropped it at once; I saw he was too
drunk."
"If you had not referred to it I should not have thought of it
again."
"A word could not set the place on fire."""
"""You are like a man who should be surprised that a tiny spark could blow
a whole powder magazine into the air."""
"""I spoke in a whisper in his ear, in a corner; how could you have heard
of it?"""
Tolkatchenko reflected suddenly.
"""I was sitting there under the table."
"Don't disturb yourselves,
gentlemen; I know every step you take."
"You smile sarcastically, Mr.
Liputin?"
"But I know, for instance, that you pinched your wife black and
blue at midnight, three days ago, in your bedroom as you were going to
bed."""
Liputin's mouth fell open and he turned pale.
"(It was afterwards found
out that he knew of this exploit of Liputin's from Agafya, Liputin's
servant, whom he had paid from the beginning to spy on him; this only
came out later.)"
"""May I state a fact?"""
"said Shigalov, getting up."
"""State it."""
Shigalov sat down and pulled himself together.
"""So far as I understand--and it's impossible not to understand it--you
yourself at first and a second time later, drew with great eloquence,
but too theoretically, a picture of Russia covered with an endless
network of knots."
"Each of these centres of activity, proselytising
and ramifying endlessly, aims by systematic denunciation to injure the
prestige of local authority, to reduce the villages to confusion,
to spread cynicism and scandals, together with complete disbelief in
everything and an eagerness for something better, and finally, by means
of fires, as a pre-eminently national method, to reduce the country at
a given moment, if need be, to desperation."
"Are those your words which
I tried to remember accurately?"
"Is that the programme you gave us as the
authorised representative of the central committee, which is to this day
utterly unknown to us and almost like a myth?"""
"""It's correct, only you are very tedious."""
"""Every one has a right to express himself in his own way."
"Giving us
to understand that the separate knots of the general network already
covering Russia number by now several hundred, and propounding the
theory that if every one does his work successfully, all Russia at a
given moment, at a signal...""

""Ah, damn it all, I have enough to do without you!"""
"cried Pyotr
Stepanovitch, twisting in his chair."
"""Very well, I'll cut it short and I'll end simply by asking if we've
seen the disorderly scenes, we've seen the discontent of the people,
we've seen and taken part in the downfall of local administration, and
finally, we've seen with our own eyes the town on fire?"
"What do you find
amiss?"
Isn't that your programme?
"What can you blame us for?"""
"""Acting on your own initiative!"""
Pyotr Stepanovitch cried furiously.
"""While I am here you ought not to have dared to act without my
permission."
Enough.
"We are on the eve of betrayal, and perhaps to-morrow
or to-night you'll be seized."
So there.
"I have authentic information."""
At this all were agape with astonishment.
"""You will be arrested not only as the instigators of the fire, but as a
quintet."
The traitor knows the whole secret of the network.
"So you see
what a mess you've made of it!"""
"""Stavrogin, no doubt,"" cried Liputin."
"""What... why Stavrogin?"""
Pyotr Stepanovitch seemed suddenly taken aback.
"""Hang it all,"" he cried, pulling himself together at once, ""it's Shatov!"
"I believe you all know now that Shatov in his time was one of the
society."
"I must tell you that, watching him through persons he does
not suspect, I found out to my amazement that he knows all about the
organisation of the network and... everything, in fact."
"To save
himself from being charged with having formerly belonged, he will give
information against all."
"He has been hesitating up till now and I have
spared him."
"Your fire has decided him: he is shaken and will hesitate
no longer."
"To-morrow we shall be arrested as incendiaries and political
offenders."""
"""Is it true?"
"How does Shatov know?"""
The excitement was indescribable.
"""It's all perfectly true."
"I have no right to reveal the source from
which I learnt it or how I discovered it, but I tell you what I can
do for you meanwhile: through one person I can act on Shatov so that
without his suspecting it he will put off giving information, but not
more than for twenty-four hours."""
All were silent.
"""We really must send him to the devil!"""
"Tolkatchenko was the first to
exclaim."
"""It ought to have been done long ago,"" Lyamshin put in malignantly,
striking the table with his fist."
"""But how is it to be done?"""
muttered Liputin.
"Pyotr Stepanovitch at once
took up the question and unfolded his plan."
"The plan was the following
day at nightfall to draw Shatov away to a secluded spot to hand over
the secret printing press which had been in his keeping and was buried
there, and there ""to settle things."""
"He went into various essential
details which we will omit here, and explained minutely Shatov's present
ambiguous attitude to the central society, of which the reader knows
already."
"""That's all very well,"" Liputin observed irresolutely, ""but since it
will be another adventure... of the same sort... it will make too great
a sensation."""
"""No doubt,"" assented Pyotr Stepanovitch, ""but I've provided against
that."
"We have the means of averting suspicion completely."""
"And with the same minuteness he told them about Kirillov, of his
intention to shoot himself, and of his promise to wait for a signal from
them and to leave a letter behind him taking on himself anything they
dictated to him (all of which the reader knows already)."
"""His determination to take his own life--a philosophic, or as I should
call it, insane decision--has become known _there_"" Pyotr Stepanovitch
went on to explain."
"""_There_ not a thread, not a grain of dust is
overlooked; everything is turned to the service of the cause."
"Foreseeing
how useful it might be and satisfying themselves that his intention was
quite serious, they had offered him the means to come to Russia (he was
set for some reason on dying in Russia), gave him a commission which he
promised to carry out (and he had done so), and had, moreover, bound him
by a promise, as you already know, to commit suicide only when he was
told to."
He promised everything.
"You must note that he belongs to the
organisation on a particular footing and is anxious to be of service;
more than that I can't tell you."
"To-morrow, _after Shatov's affair_, I'll
dictate a note to him saying that he is responsible for his death."
"That
will seem very plausible: they were friends and travelled together to
America, there they quarrelled; and it will all be explained in the
letter... and... and perhaps, if it seems feasible, we might dictate
something more to Kirillov--something about the manifestoes, for
instance, and even perhaps about the fire."
"But I'll think about
that."
"You needn't worry yourselves, he has no prejudices; he'll sign
anything."""
There were expressions of doubt.
It sounded a fantastic story.
"But they
had all heard more or less about Kirillov; Liputin more than all."
"""He may change his mind and not want to,"" said Shigalov; ""he is a madman
anyway, so he is not much to build upon."""
"""Don't be uneasy, gentlemen, he will want to,"" Pyotr Stepanovitch
snapped out."
"""I am obliged by our agreement to give him warning the day
before, so it must be to-day."
"I invite Liputin to go with me at once to
see him and make certain, and he will tell you, gentlemen, when he comes
back--to-day if need be--whether what I say is true."
"However,"" he broke
off suddenly with intense exasperation, as though he suddenly felt he
was doing people like them too much honour by wasting time in persuading
them, ""however, do as you please."
"If you don't decide to do it,
the union is broken up--but solely through your insubordination and
treachery."
In that case we are all independent from this moment.
"But
under those circumstances, besides the unpleasantness of Shatov's
betrayal and its consequences, you will have brought upon yourselves
another little unpleasantness of which you were definitely warned when
the union was formed."
"As far as I am concerned, I am not much afraid of
you, gentlemen.... Don't imagine that I am so involved with you...."
"But
that's no matter."""
"""Yes, we decide to do it,"" Liputin pronounced."
"""There's no other way out of it,"" muttered Tolkatchenko, ""and if only
Liputin confirms about Kirillov, then...

""I am against it; with all my soul and strength I protest against such a
murderous decision,"" said Virginsky, standing up."
"""But?"""
"asked Pyotr Stepanovitch....

""_But_ what?"""
"""You said _but_... and I am waiting."""
"""I don't think I did say _but_..."
"I only meant to say that if you decide
to do it, then...""

""Then?"""
Virginsky did not answer.
"""I think that one is at liberty to neglect danger to one's own life,""
said Erkel, suddenly opening his mouth, ""but if it may injure the cause,
then I consider one ought not to dare to neglect danger to one's
life....""

He broke off in confusion, blushing."
"Absorbed as they all were in their
own ideas, they all looked at him in amazement--it was such a surprise
that he too could speak."
"""I am for the cause,"" Virginsky pronounced suddenly."
Every one got up.
"It was decided to communicate once more and make final
arrangements at midday on the morrow, though without meeting."
"The place
where the printing press was hidden was announced and each was assigned
his part and his duty."
"Liputin and Pyotr Stepanovitch promptly set off
together to Kirillov."
"II

All our fellows believed that Shatov was going to betray them; but they
also believed that Pyotr Stepanovitch was playing with them like pawns."
"And yet they knew, too, that in any case they would all meet on the spot
next day and that Shatov's fate was sealed."
"They suddenly felt like
flies caught in a web by a huge spider; they were furious, but they were
trembling with terror."
"Pyotr Stepanovitch, of course, had treated them badly; it might all have
gone off far more harmoniously and easily if he had taken the trouble
to embellish the facts ever so little."
"Instead of putting the facts in a
decorous light, as an exploit worthy of ancient Rome or something of the
sort, he simply appealed to their animal fears and laid stress on the
danger to their own skins, which was simply insulting; of course there
was a struggle for existence in everything and there was no other
principle in nature, they all knew that, but still...."
"But Pyotr Stepanovitch had no time to trot out the Romans; he was
completely thrown out of his reckoning."
"Stavrogin's flight had astounded
and crushed him."
"It was a lie when he said that Stavrogin had seen the
vice-governor; what worried Pyotr Stepanovitch was that Stavrogin had
gone off without seeing anyone, even his mother--and it was certainly
strange that he had been allowed to leave without hindrance."
(The authorities were called to account for it afterwards.)
"Pyotr
Stepanovitch had been making inquiries all day, but so far had found out
nothing, and he had never been so upset."
"And how could he, how could he
give up Stavrogin all at once like this!"
"That was why he could not
be very tender with the quintet."
"Besides, they tied his hands: he had
already decided to gallop after Stavrogin at once; and meanwhile he was
detained by Shatov; he had to cement the quintet together once for all,
in case of emergency."
"""Pity to waste them, they might be of use."""
"That,
I imagine, was his way of reasoning."
"As for Shatov, Pyotr Stepanovitch was firmly convinced that he would
betray them."
"All that he had told the others about it was a lie: he had
never seen the document nor heard of it, but he thought it as certain as
that twice two makes four."
"It seemed to him that what had happened--the
death of Liza, the death of Marya Timofyevna--would be too much for
Shatov, and that he would make up his mind at once."
Who knows?
"perhaps
he had grounds for supposing it."
"It is known, too, that he hated Shatov
personally; there had at some time been a quarrel between them, and
Pyotr Stepanovitch never forgave an offence."
"I am convinced, indeed,
that this was his leading motive."
"We have narrow brick pavements in our town, and in some streets only
raised wooden planks instead of a pavement."
"Pyotr Stepanovitch walked
in the middle of the pavement, taking up the whole of it, utterly
regardless of Liputin, who had no room to walk beside him and so had to
hurry a step behind or run in the muddy road if he wanted to speak to
him."
"Pyotr Stepanovitch suddenly remembered how he had lately splashed
through the mud to keep pace with Stavrogin, who had walked, as he was
doing now, taking up the whole pavement."
"He recalled the whole scene,
and rage choked him."
"But Liputin, too, was choking with resentment."
"Pyotr Stepanovitch might
treat the others as he liked, but him!"
"Why, he knew more than all the
rest, was in closer touch with the work and taking more intimate part
in it than anyone, and hitherto his services had been continual, though
indirect."
"Oh, he knew that even now Pyotr Stepanovitch might ruin him _if
it came to the worst._ But he had long hated Pyotr Stepanovitch, and not
because he was a danger but because of his overbearing manner."
"Now, when
he had to make up his mind to such a deed, he raged inwardly more than
all the rest put together."
Alas!
"he knew that next day ""like a slave""
he would be the first on the spot and would bring the others, and if
he could somehow have murdered Pyotr Stepanovitch before the morrow,
without ruining himself, of course, he would certainly have murdered
him."
"Absorbed in his sensations, he trudged dejectedly after his tormentor,
who seemed to have forgotten his existence, though he gave him a
rude and careless shove with his elbow now and then."
"Suddenly Pyotr
Stepanovitch halted in one of the principal thoroughfares and went into
a restaurant."
"""What are you doing?"""
"cried Liputin, boiling over."
"""This is a
restaurant."""
"""I want a beefsteak."""
"""Upon my word!"
"It is always full of people."""
"""What if it is?"""
"""But... we shall be late."
"It's ten o'clock already."""
"""You can't be too late to go there."""
"""But I shall be late!"
"They are expecting me back."""
"""Well, let them; but it would be stupid of you to go to them."
"With all
your bobbery I've had no dinner."
"And the later you go to Kirillov's the
more sure you are to find him."""
Pyotr Stepanovitch went to a room apart.
"Liputin sat in an easy chair on
one side, angry and resentful, and watched him eating."
"Half an hour
and more passed."
"Pyotr Stepanovitch did not hurry himself; he ate with
relish, rang the bell, asked for a different kind of mustard, then for
beer, without saying a word to Liputin."
He was pondering deeply.
"He was
capable of doing two things at once--eating with relish and pondering
deeply."
"Liputin loathed him so intensely at last that he could not tear
himself away."
It was like a nervous obsession.
"He counted every morsel
of beefsteak that Pyotr Stepanovitch put into his mouth; he loathed him
for the way he opened it, for the way he chewed, for the way he smacked
his lips over the fat morsels, he loathed the steak itself."
"At last
things began to swim before his eyes; he began to feel slightly giddy;
he felt hot and cold run down his spine by turns."
"""You are doing nothing; read that,"" said Pyotr Stepanovitch suddenly,
throwing him a sheet of paper."
Liputin went nearer to the candle.
"The
paper was closely covered with bad handwriting, with corrections in
every line."
"By the time he had mastered it Pyotr Stepanovitch had paid
his bill and was ready to go."
"When they were on the pavement Liputin
handed him back the paper."
"""Keep it; I'll tell you afterwards.... What do you say to it, though?"""
Liputin shuddered all over.
"""In my opinion... such a manifesto... is nothing but a ridiculous
absurdity."""
"His anger broke out; he felt as though he were being caught up and
carried along."
"""If we decide to distribute such manifestoes,"" he said, quivering
all over, ""we'll make ourselves, contemptible by our stupidity and
incompetence."""
"""H'm!"
"I think differently,"" said Pyotr Stepanovitch, walking on
resolutely."
"""So do I; surely it isn't your work?"""
"""That's not your business."""
"""I think too that doggerel, 'A Noble Personality,' is the most utter
trash possible, and it couldn't have been written by Herzen."""
"""You are talking nonsense; it's a good poem."""
"""I am surprised, too, for instance,"" said Liputin, still dashing along
with desperate leaps, ""that it is suggested that we should act so as
to bring everything to the ground."
"It's natural in Europe to wish to
destroy everything because there's a proletariat there, but we are only
amateurs here and in my opinion are only showing off."""
"""I thought you were a Fourierist."""
"""Fourier says something quite different, quite different."""
"""I know it's nonsense."""
"""No, Fourier isn't nonsense...."
"Excuse me, I can't believe that there
will be a rising in May."""
"Liputin positively unbuttoned his coat, he was so hot."
"""Well, that's enough; but now, that I mayn't forget it,"" said Pyotr
Stepanovitch, passing with extraordinary coolness to another subject,
""you will have to print this manifesto with your own hands."
"We're going
to dig up Shatov's printing press, and you will take it to-morrow."
"As
quickly as possible you must print as many copies as you can, and then
distribute them all the winter."
The means will be provided.
"You must
do as many copies as possible, for you'll be asked for them from other
places."""
"""No, excuse me; I can't undertake such a..."
"I decline."""
"""You'll take it all the same."
"I am acting on the instructions of the
central committee, and you are bound to obey."""
"""And I consider that our centres abroad have forgotten what Russia is
like and have lost all touch, and that's why they talk such
nonsense...."
"I even think that instead of many hundreds of quintets in
Russia, we are the only one that exists, and there is no network at
all,"" Liputin gasped finally."
"""The more contemptible of you, then, to run after the cause without
believing in it... and you are running after me now like a mean little
cur."""
"""No, I'm not."
"We have a full right to break off and found a new
society."""
"""Fool!"""
"Pyotr Stepanovitch boomed at him threateningly all of a sudden,
with flashing eyes."
They stood facing one another for some time.
"Pyotr Stepanovitch turned
and pursued his way confidently."
"The idea flashed through Liputin's mind, ""Turn and go back; if I don't
turn now I shall never go back."""
"He pondered this for ten steps, but at
the eleventh a new and desperate idea flashed into his mind: he did not
turn and did not go back."
"They were approaching Filipov's house, but before reaching it they
turned down a side street, or, to be more accurate, an inconspicuous
path under a fence, so that for some time they had to walk along a steep
slope above a ditch where they could not keep their footing without
holding the fence."
"At a dark corner in the slanting fence Pyotr
Stepanovitch took out a plank, leaving a gap, through which he promptly
scrambled."
"Liputin was surprised, but he crawled through after him; then
they replaced the plank after them."
"This was the secret way by which
Fedka used to visit Kirillov."
"""Shatov mustn't know that we are here,"" Pyotr Stepanovitch whispered
sternly to Liputin."
"III

Kirillov was sitting on his leather sofa drinking tea, as he always was
at that hour."
"He did not get up to meet them, but gave a sort of start
and looked at the new-comers anxiously."
"""You are not mistaken,"" said Pyotr Stepanovitch, ""it's just that I've
come about."""
"""To-day?"""
"""No, no, to-morrow... about this time."""
"And he hurriedly sat down at
the table, watching Kirillov's agitation with some uneasiness."
"But the
latter had already regained his composure and looked as usual."
"""These people still refuse to believe in you."
"You are not vexed at my
bringing Liputin?"""
"""To-day I am not vexed; to-morrow I want to be alone."""
"""But not before I come, and therefore in my presence."""
"""I should prefer not in your presence."""
"""You remember you promised to write and to sign all I dictated."""
"""I don't care."
"And now will you be here long?"""
"""I have to see one man and to remain half an hour, so whatever you say I
shall stay that half-hour."""
Kirillov did not speak.
"Liputin meanwhile sat down on one side under the
portrait of the bishop."
"That last desperate idea gained more and more
possession of him."
Kirillov scarcely noticed him.
"Liputin had heard
of Kirillov's theory before and always laughed at him; but now he was
silent and looked gloomily round him."
"""I've no objection to some tea,"" said Pyotr Stepanovitch, moving up."
"""I've just had some steak and was reckoning on getting tea with you."""
"""Drink it."
"You can have some if you like."""
"""You used to offer it to me,"" observed Pyotr Stepanovitch sourly."
"""That's no matter."
"Let Liputin have some too."""
"""No, I..."
"can't."""
"""Don't want to or can't?"""
"said Pyotr Stepanovitch, turning quickly to
him."
"""I am not going to here,"" Liputin said expressively."
Pyotr Stepanovitch frowned.
"""There's a flavour of mysticism about that; goodness knows what to make
of you people!"""
No one answered; there was a full minute of silence.
"""But I know one thing,"" he added abruptly, ""that no superstition will
prevent any one of us from doing his duty."""
"""Has Stavrogin gone?"""
asked Kirillov.
"""Yes."""
"""He's done well."""
"Pyotr Stepanovitch's eyes gleamed, but he restrained himself."
"""I don't care what you think as long as every one keeps his word."""
"""I'll keep my word."""
"""I always knew that you would do your duty like an independent and
progressive man."""
"""You are an absurd fellow."""
"""That may be; I am very glad to amuse you."
"I am always glad if I can
give people pleasure."""
"""You are very anxious I should shoot myself and are afraid I might
suddenly not?"""
"""Well, you see, it was your own doing--connecting your plan with our
work."
"Reckoning on your plan we have already done something, so that you
couldn't refuse now because you've let us in for it."""
"""You've no claim at all."""
"""I understand, I understand; you are perfectly free, and we don't come
in so long as your free intention is carried out."""
"""And am I to take on myself all the nasty things you've done?"""
"""Listen, Kirillov, are you afraid?"
"If you want to cry off, say so at
once."""
"""I am not afraid."""
"""I ask because you are making so many inquiries."""
"""Are you going soon?"""
"""Asking questions again?"""
Kirillov scanned him contemptuously.
"""You see,"" Pyotr Stepanovitch went on, getting angrier and angrier, and
unable to take the right tone, ""you want me to go away, to be alone, to
concentrate yourself, but all that's a bad sign for you--for you above
all."
You want to think a great deal.
To my mind you'd better not think.
"And really you make me uneasy."""
"""There's only one thing I hate, that at such a moment I should have a
reptile like you beside me."""
"""Oh, that doesn't matter."
"I'll go away at the time and stand on the
steps if you like."
"If you are so concerned about trifles when it comes
to dying, then... it's all a very bad sign."
"I'll go out on to the
steps and you can imagine I know nothing about it, and that I am a man
infinitely below you."""
"""No, not infinitely; you've got abilities, but there's a lot you don't
understand because you are a low man."""
"""Delighted, delighted."
"I told you already I am delighted to provide
entertainment... at such a moment."""
"""You don't understand anything."""
"""That is, I... well, I listen with respect, anyway."""
"""You can do nothing; even now you can't hide your petty spite, though
it's not to your interest to show it."
"You'll make me cross, and then I
may want another six months."""
Pyotr Stepanovitch looked at his watch.
"""I never understood your theory, but I know you didn't invent it for our
sakes, so I suppose you would carry it out apart from us."
"And I know too
that you haven't mastered the idea but the idea has mastered you, so you
won't put it off."""
"""What?"
"The idea has mastered me?"""
"""Yes."""
"""And not I mastered the idea?"
That's good.
You have a little sense.
"Only
you tease me and I am proud."""
"""That's a good thing, that's a good thing."
"Just what you need, to be
proud."""
"""Enough."
"You've drunk your tea; go away."""
"""Damn it all, I suppose I must""--Pyotr Stepanovitch got up--""though
it's early."
"Listen, Kirillov."
"Shall I find that man--you know whom I
mean--at Myasnitchiha's?"
"Or has she too been lying?"""
"""You won't find him, because he is here and not there."""
"""Here!"
"Damn it all, where?"""
"""Sitting in the kitchen, eating and drinking."""
"""How dared he?"""
"cried Pyotr Stepanovitch, flushing angrily."
"""It was his
duty to wait... what nonsense!"
"He has no passport, no money!"""
"""I don't know."
He came to say good-bye; he is dressed and ready.
"He
is going away and won't come back."
"He says you are a scoundrel and he
doesn't want to wait for your money."""
"""Ha ha!"
He is afraid that I'll...
"But even now I can... if... Where is
he, in the kitchen?"""
"Kirillov opened a side door into a tiny dark room; from this room three
steps led straight to the part of the kitchen where the cook's bed was
usually put, behind the partition."
"Here, in the corner under the ikons,
Fedka was sitting now, at a bare deal table."
"Before him stood a
pint bottle, a plate of bread, and some cold beef and potatoes on an
earthenware dish."
"He was eating in a leisurely way and was already half
drunk, but he was wearing his sheep-skin coat and was evidently ready
for a journey."
"A samovar was boiling the other side of the screen, but
it was not for Fedka, who had every night for a week or more zealously
blown it up and got it ready for ""Alexey Nilitch, for he's such a habit
of drinking tea at nights."""
"I am strongly disposed to believe that,
as Kirillov had not a cook, he had cooked the beef and potatoes that
morning with his own hands for Fedka."
"""What notion is this?"""
"cried Pyotr Stepanovitch, whisking into the room."
"""Why didn't you wait where you were ordered?"""
"And swinging his fist, he brought it down heavily on the table."
Fedka assumed an air of dignity.
"""You wait a bit, Pyotr Stepanovitch, you wait a bit,"" he began, with a
swaggering emphasis on each word, ""it's your first duty to understand
here that you are on a polite visit to Mr. Kirillov, Alexey Nilitch,
whose boots you might clean any day, because beside you he is a man of
culture and you are only--foo!"""
And he made a jaunty show of spitting to one side.
"Haughtiness and
determination were evident in his manner, and a certain very threatening
assumption of argumentative calm that suggested an outburst to follow."
"But Pyotr Stepanovitch had no time to realise the danger, and it did not
fit in with his preconceived ideas."
"The incidents and disasters of the
day had quite turned his head."
"Liputin, at the top of the three steps,
stared inquisitively down from the little dark room."
"""Do you or don't you want a trustworthy passport and good money to go
where you've been told?"
"Yes or no?"""
"""D'you see, Pyotr Stepanovitch, you've been deceiving me from the first,
and so you've been a regular scoundrel to me."
"For all the world like a
filthy human louse--that's how I look on you."
"You've promised me a lot
of money for shedding innocent blood and swore it was for Mr. Stavrogin,
though it turns out to be nothing but your want of breeding."
"I didn't
get a farthing out of it, let alone fifteen hundred, and Mr. Stavrogin
hit you in the face, which has come to our ears."
"Now you are threatening
me again and promising me money--what for, you don't say."
"And I
shouldn't wonder if you are sending me to Petersburg to plot some
revenge in your spite against Mr. Stavrogin, Nikolay Vsyevolodovitch,
reckoning on my simplicity."
And that proves you are the chief murderer.
"And do you know what you deserve for the very fact that in the depravity
of your heart you've given up believing in God Himself, the true
Creator?"
"You are no better than an idolater and are on a level with
the Tatar and the Mordva."
"Alexey Nilitch, who is a philosopher, has
expounded the true God, the Creator, many a time to you, as well as the
creation of the world and the fate that's to come and the transformation
of every sort of creature and every sort of beast out of the Apocalypse,
but you've persisted like a senseless idol in your deafness and your
dumbness and have brought Ensign Erkel to the same, like the veriest
evil seducer and so-called atheist....""

""Ah, you drunken dog!"
"He strips the ikons of their setting and then
preaches about God!"""
"""D'you see, Pyotr Stepanovitch, I tell you truly that I have stripped
the ikons, but I only took out the pearls; and how do you know?"
"Perhaps
my own tear was transformed into a pearl in the furnace of the Most High
to make up for my sufferings, seeing I am just that very orphan, having
no daily refuge."
"Do you know from the books that once, in ancient times,
a merchant with just such tearful sighs and prayers stole a pearl from
the halo of the Mother of God, and afterwards, in the face of all the
people, laid the whole price of it at her feet, and the Holy Mother
sheltered him with her mantle before all the people, so that it was a
miracle, and the command was given through the authorities to write it
all down word for word in the Imperial books."
"And you let a mouse in,
so you insulted the very throne of God."
"And if you were not my natural
master, whom I dandled in my arms when I was a stripling, I would have
done for you now, without budging from this place!"""
Pyotr Stepanovitch flew into a violent rage.
"""Tell me, have you seen Stavrogin to-day?"""
"""Don't you dare to question me."
"Mr. Stavrogin is fairly amazed at you,
and he had no share in it even in wish, let alone instructions or giving
money."
"You've presumed with me."""
"""You'll get the money and you'll get another two thousand in Petersburg,
when you get there, in a lump sum, and you'll get more."""
"""You are lying, my fine gentleman, and it makes me laugh to see how
easily you are taken in."
"Mr. Stavrogin stands at the top of the ladder
above you, and you yelp at him from below like a silly puppy dog, while
he thinks it would be doing you an honour to spit at you."""
"""But do you know,"" cried Pyotr Stepanovitch in a rage, ""that I won't
let you stir a step from here, you scoundrel, and I'll hand you straight
over to the police."""
Fedka leapt on to his feet and his eyes gleamed with fury.
"Pyotr
Stepanovitch pulled out his revolver."
"Then followed a rapid and
revolting scene: before Pyotr Stepanovitch could take aim, Fedka swung
round and in a flash struck him on the cheek with all his might."
"Then
there was the thud of a second blow, a third, then a fourth, all on the
cheek."
"Pyotr Stepanovitch was dazed; with his eyes starting out of his
head, he muttered something, and suddenly crashed full length to the
ground."
"""There you are; take him,"" shouted Fedka with a triumphant swagger; he
instantly took up his cap, his bag from under the bench, and was gone."
Pyotr Stepanovitch lay gasping and unconscious.
"Liputin even imagined
that he had been murdered."
Kirillov ran headlong into the kitchen.
"""Water!"""
"he cried, and ladling some water in an iron dipper from a
bucket, he poured it over the injured man's head."
"Pyotr Stepanovitch
stirred, raised his head, sat up, and looked blankly about him."
"""Well, how are you?"""
asked Kirillov.
"Pyotr Stepanovitch looked at him
intently, still not recognising him; but seeing Liputin peeping in from
the kitchen, he smiled his hateful smile and suddenly got up, picking up
his revolver from the floor."
"""If you take it into your head to run away to-morrow like that scoundrel
Stavrogin,"" he cried, pouncing furiously on Kirillov, pale, stammering,
and hardly able to articulate his words, ""I'll hang you... like a
fly... or crush you... if it's at the other end of the world... do you
understand!"""
"And he held the revolver straight at Kirillov's head; but almost at the
same minute, coming completely to himself, he drew back his hand, thrust
the revolver into his pocket, and without saying another word ran out of
the house."
Liputin followed him.
"They clambered through the same gap and
again walked along the slope holding to the fence."
"Pyotr Stepanovitch
strode rapidly down the street so that Liputin could scarcely keep up
with him."
At the first crossing he suddenly stopped.
"""Well?"""
He turned to Liputin with a challenge.
"Liputin remembered the revolver and was still trembling all over after
the scene he had witnessed; but the answer seemed to come of itself
irresistibly from his tongue:

""I think..."
"I think that...""

""Did you see what Fedka was drinking in the kitchen?"""
"""What he was drinking?"
"He was drinking vodka."""
"""Well then, let me tell you it's the last time in his life he will drink
vodka."
I recommend you to remember that and reflect on it.
"And now go to
hell; you are not wanted till to-morrow."
"But mind now, don't be a fool!"""
Liputin rushed home full speed.
"IV

He had long had a passport in readiness made out in a false name."
"It
seems a wild idea that this prudent little man, the petty despot of
his family, who was, above all things, a sharp man of business and a
capitalist, and who was an official too (though he was a Fourierist),
should long before have conceived the fantastic project of procuring
this passport in case of emergency, that he might escape abroad by means
of it _if_... he did admit the possibility of this if, though no doubt he
was never able himself to formulate what this _if_ might mean."
"But now it suddenly formulated itself, and in a most unexpected way."
"That desperate idea with which he had gone to Kirillov's after that
""fool"" he had heard from Pyotr Stepanovitch on the pavement, had been
to abandon everything at dawn next day and to emigrate abroad."
"If anyone
doubts that such fantastic incidents occur in everyday Russian life,
even now, let him look into the biographies of all the Russian exiles
abroad."
Not one of them escaped with more wisdom or real justification.
"It has always been the unrestrained domination of phantoms and nothing
more."
"Running home, he began by locking himself in, getting out his travelling
bag, and feverishly beginning to pack."
"His chief anxiety was the
question of money, and how much he could rescue from the impending
ruin--and by what means."
"He thought of it as ""rescuing,"" for it seemed
to him that he could not linger an hour, and that by daylight he must
be on the high road."
"He did not know where to take the train either; he
vaguely determined to take it at the second or third big station from
the town, and to make his way there on foot, if necessary."
"In that way,
instinctively and mechanically he busied himself in his packing with a
perfect whirl of ideas in his head--and suddenly stopped short, gave it
all up, and with a deep groan stretched himself on the sofa."
"He felt clearly, and suddenly realised that he might escape, but that
he was by now utterly incapable of deciding whether he ought to make off
_before or after_ Shatov's death; that he was simply a lifeless body, a
crude inert mass; that he was being moved by an awful outside power; and
that, though he had a passport to go abroad, that though he could run
away from Shatov (otherwise what need was there of such haste?"
"), yet he
would run away, not from Shatov, not before his murder, but _after_ it,
and that that was determined, signed, and sealed."
"In insufferable distress, trembling every instant and wondering at
himself, alternately groaning aloud and numb with terror, he managed to
exist till eleven o'clock next morning locked in and lying on the sofa;
then came the shock he was awaiting, and it at once determined him."
"When
he unlocked his door and went out to his household at eleven o'clock
they told him that the runaway convict and brigand, Fedka, who was a
terror to every one, who had pillaged churches and only lately been
guilty of murder and arson, who was being pursued and could not be
captured by our police, had been found at daybreak murdered, five miles
from the town, at a turning off the high road, and that the whole town
was talking of it already."
"He rushed headlong out of the house at once
to find out further details, and learned, to begin with, that Fedka, who
had been found with his skull broken, had apparently been robbed and,
secondly, that the police already had strong suspicion and even good
grounds for believing that the murderer was one of the Shpigulin men
called Fomka, the very one who had been his accomplice in murdering the
Lebyadkins and setting fire to their house, and that there had been a
quarrel between them on the road about a large sum of money stolen from
Lebyadkin, which Fedka was supposed to have hidden."
"Liputin ran to Pyotr
Stepanovitch's lodgings and succeeded in learning at the back door, on
the sly, that though Pyotr Stepanovitch had not returned home till about
one o'clock at night, he had slept there quietly all night till eight
o'clock next morning."
"Of course, there could be no doubt that there was
nothing extraordinary about Fedka's death, and that such careers usually
have such an ending; but the coincidence of the fatal words that ""it was
the last time Fedka would drink vodka,"" with the prompt fulfilment of
the prediction, was so remarkable that Liputin no longer hesitated."
"The
shock had been given; it was as though a stone had fallen upon him and
crushed him forever."
"Returning home, he thrust his travelling-bag under
the bed without a word, and in the evening at the hour fixed he was the
first to appear at the appointed spot to meet Shatov, though it's true
he still had his passport in his pocket."
"CHAPTER V. A WANDERER


I

THE CATASTROPHE WITH Liza and the death of Marya Timofyevna made an
overwhelming impression on Shatov."
"I have already mentioned that that
morning I met him in passing; he seemed to me not himself."
"He told me
among other things that on the evening before at nine o'clock (that
is, three hours before the fire had broken out) he had been at Marya
Timofyevna's."
"He went in the morning to look at the corpses, but as far
as I know gave no evidence of any sort that morning."
"Meanwhile, towards
the end of the day there was a perfect tempest in his soul, and..."
"I
think I can say with certainty that there was a moment at dusk when he
wanted to get up, go out and tell everything."
"What that _everything_ was,
no one but he could say."
"Of course he would have achieved nothing, and
would have simply betrayed himself."
"He had no proofs whatever with which
to convict the perpetrators of the crime, and, indeed, he had nothing
but vague conjectures to go upon, though to him they amounted to
complete certainty."
"But he was ready to ruin himself if he could only
""crush the scoundrels""--his own words."
"Pyotr Stepanovitch had guessed
fairly correctly at this impulse in him, and he knew himself that he
was risking a great deal in putting off the execution of his new
awful project till next day."
"On his side there was, as usual, great
self-confidence and contempt for all these ""wretched creatures"" and for
Shatov in particular."
"He had for years despised Shatov for his ""whining
idiocy,"" as he had expressed it in former days abroad, and he was
absolutely confident that he could deal with such a guileless creature,
that is, keep an eye on him all that day, and put a check on him at the
first sign of danger."
"Yet what saved ""the scoundrels"" for a short time
was something quite unexpected which they had not foreseen...."
"Towards eight o'clock in the evening (at the very time when the quintet
was meeting at Erkel's, and waiting in indignation and excitement for
Pyotr Stepanovitch) Shatov was lying in the dark on his bed with a
headache and a slight chill; he was tortured by uncertainty, he was
angry, he kept making up his mind, and could not make it up finally, and
felt, with a curse, that it would all lead to nothing."
"Gradually he sank
into a brief doze and had something like a nightmare."
"He dreamt that
he was lying on his bed, tied up with cords and unable to stir, and
meantime he heard a terrible banging that echoed all over the house, a
banging on the fence, at the gate, at his door, in Kirillov's lodge,
so that the whole house was shaking, and a far-away familiar voice that
wrung his heart was calling to him piteously."
"He suddenly woke and sat
up in bed."
"To his surprise the banging at the gate went on, though
not nearly so violent as it had seemed in his dream."
"The knocks were
repeated and persistent, and the strange voice ""that wrung his heart""
could still be heard below at the gate, though not piteously but angrily
and impatiently, alternating with another voice, more restrained and
ordinary."
"He jumped up, opened the casement pane and put his head out."
"""Who's there?"""
"he called, literally numb with terror."
"""If you are Shatov,"" the answer came harshly and resolutely from below,
""be so good as to tell me straight out and honestly whether you agree to
let me in or not?"""
It was true: he recognised the voice!
"""Marie!..."
"Is it you?"""
"""Yes, yes, Marya Shatov, and I assure you I can't keep the driver a
minute longer."""
"""This minute..."
"I'll get a candle,"" Shatov cried faintly."
"Then he rushed
to look for the matches."
"The matches, as always happens at such moments,
could not be found."
"He dropped the candlestick and the candle on the
floor and as soon as he heard the impatient voice from below again, he
abandoned the search and dashed down the steep stairs to open the gate."
"""Be so good as to hold the bag while I settle with this blockhead,"" was
how Madame Marya Shatov greeted him below, and she thrust into his hands
a rather light cheap canvas handbag studded with brass nails, of Dresden
manufacture."
She attacked the driver with exasperation.
"""Allow me to tell you, you are asking too much."
"If you've been driving
me for an extra hour through these filthy streets, that's your fault,
because it seems you didn't know where to find this stupid street and
imbecile house."
"Take your thirty kopecks and make up your mind that
you'll get nothing more."""
"""Ech, lady, you told me yourself Voznesensky Street and this is
Bogoyavlensky; Voznesensky is ever so far away."
"You've simply put the
horse into a steam."""
"""Voznesensky, Bogoyavlensky--you ought to know all those stupid names
better than I do, as you are an inhabitant; besides, you are unfair, I
told you first of all Filipov's house and you declared you knew it."
"In
any case you can have me up to-morrow in the local court, but now I beg
you to let me alone."""
"""Here, here's another five kopecks."""
"With eager haste Shatov pulled a
five-kopeck piece out of his pocket and gave it to the driver."
"""Do me a favour, I beg you, don't dare to do that!"""
"Madame Shatov flared
up, but the driver drove off and Shatov, taking her hand, drew her
through the gate."
"""Make haste, Marie, make haste... that's no matter, and... you are wet
through."
"Take care, we go up here--how sorry I am there's no light--the
stairs are steep, hold tight, hold tight!"
"Well, this is my room."
"Excuse
my having no light... One minute!"""
"He picked up the candlestick but it was a long time before the matches
were found."
"Madame Shatov stood waiting in the middle of the room,
silent and motionless."
"""Thank God, here they are at last!"""
"he cried joyfully, lighting up the
room."
Marya Shatov took a cursory survey of his abode.
"""They told me you lived in a poor way, but I didn't expect it to be
as bad as this,"" she pronounced with an air of disgust, and she moved
towards the bed."
"""Oh, I am tired!"""
"she sat down on the hard bed, with an exhausted air."
"""Please put down the bag and sit down on the chair yourself."
"Just as you
like though; you are in the way standing there."
"I have come to you for
a time, till I can get work, because I know nothing of this place and I
have no money."
"But if I shall be in your way I beg you again, be so good
as to tell me so at once, as you are bound to do if you are an honest
man."
"I could sell something to-morrow and pay for a room at an hotel,
but you must take me to the hotel yourself.... Oh, but I am tired!"""
Shatov was all of a tremor.
"""You mustn't, Marie, you mustn't go to an hotel!"
An hotel!
What for?
"What for?"""
"He clasped his hands imploringly....

""Well, if I can get on without the hotel..."
"I must, any way, explain the
position."
"Remember, Shatov, that we lived in Geneva as man and wife for
a fortnight and a few days; it's three years since we parted, without
any particular quarrel though."
"But don't imagine that I've come back
to renew any of the foolishness of the past."
"I've come back to look for
work, and that I've come straight to this town is just because it's all
the same to me."
"I've not come to say I am sorry for anything; please
don't imagine anything so stupid as that."""
"""Oh, Marie!"
"This is unnecessary, quite unnecessary,"" Shatov muttered
vaguely."
"""If so, if you are so far developed as to be able to understand that, I
may allow myself to add, that if I've come straight to you now and am
in your lodging, it's partly because I always thought you were far
from being a scoundrel and were perhaps much better than other..."
"blackguards!"""
Her eyes flashed.
"She must have had to bear a great deal at the hands of
some ""blackguards."""
"""And please believe me, I wasn't laughing at you just now when I told
you you were good."
"I spoke plainly, without fine phrases and I can't
endure them."
But that's all nonsense.
"I always hoped you would have
sense enough not to pester me...."
"Enough, I am tired."""
"And she bent on him a long, harassed and weary gaze."
"Shatov stood
facing her at the other end of the room, which was five paces away, and
listened to her timidly with a look of new life and unwonted radiance
on his face."
"This strong, rugged man, all bristles on the surface,
was suddenly all softness and shining gladness."
"There was a thrill
of extraordinary and unexpected feeling in his soul."
"Three years of
separation, three years of the broken marriage had effaced nothing from
his heart."
"And perhaps every day during those three years he had dreamed
of her, of that beloved being who had once said to him, ""I love you."""
"Knowing Shatov I can say with certainty that he could never have allowed
himself even to dream that a woman might say to him, ""I love you."""
"He was savagely modest and chaste, he looked on himself as a perfect
monster, detested his own face as well as his character, compared
himself to some freak only fit to be exhibited at fairs."
"Consequently
he valued honesty above everything and was fanatically devoted to his
convictions; he was gloomy, proud, easily moved to wrath, and sparing
of words."
"But here was the one being who had loved him for a fortnight
(that he had never doubted, never!"
"), a being he had always considered
immeasurably above him in spite of his perfectly sober understanding of
her errors; a being to whom he could forgive everything, _everything_ (of
that there could be no question; indeed it was quite the other way, his
idea was that he was entirely to blame); this woman, this Marya Shatov,
was in his house, in his presence again... it was almost inconceivable!"
"He was so overcome, there was so much that was terrible and at the same
time so much happiness in this event that he could not, perhaps would
not--perhaps was afraid to--realise the position."
It was a dream.
"But
when she looked at him with that harassed gaze he suddenly understood
that this woman he loved so dearly was suffering, perhaps had been
wronged."
His heart went cold.
"He looked at her features with anguish:
the first bloom of youth had long faded from this exhausted face."
"It's
true that she was still good-looking--in his eyes a beauty, as she had
always been."
"In reality she was a woman of twenty-five, rather strongly
built, above the medium height (taller than Shatov), with abundant dark
brown hair, a pale oval face, and large dark eyes now glittering with
feverish brilliance."
"But the light-hearted, naïve and good-natured
energy he had known so well in the past was replaced now by a sullen
irritability and disillusionment, a sort of cynicism which was not yet
habitual to her herself, and which weighed upon her."
"But the chief thing
was that she was ill, that he could see clearly."
"In spite of the awe in
which he stood of her he suddenly went up to her and took her by both
hands."
"""Marie... you know... you are very tired, perhaps, for God's sake, don't
be angry...."
"If you'd consent to have some tea, for instance, eh?"
"Tea
picks one up so, doesn't it?"
"If you'd consent!"""
"""Why talk about consenting!"
"Of course I consent, what a baby you are
still."
Get me some if you can.
How cramped you are here.
"How cold it
is!"""
"""Oh, I'll get some logs for the fire directly, some logs..."
"I've got
logs."""
Shatov was all astir.
"""Logs... that is... but I'll get tea
directly,"" he waved his hand as though with desperate determination and
snatched up his cap."
"""Where are you going?"
"So you've no tea in the house?"""
"""There shall be, there shall be, there shall be, there shall be
everything directly...."
"I..."" he took his revolver from the shelf, ""I'll
sell this revolver directly... or pawn it....""

""What foolishness and what a time that will take!"
"Take my money if
you've nothing, there's eighty kopecks here, I think; that's all I have."
"This is like a madhouse."""
"""I don't want your money, I don't want it I'll be here directly, in one
instant."
"I can manage without the revolver....""

And he rushed straight to Kirillov's."
"This was probably two hours before
the visit of Pyotr Stepanovitch and Liputin to Kirillov."
"Though Shatov
and Kirillov lived in the same yard they hardly ever saw each other, and
when they met they did not nod or speak: they had been too long ""lying
side by side"" in America....

""Kirillov, you always have tea; have you got tea and a samovar?"""
"Kirillov, who was walking up and down the room, as he was in the habit
of doing all night, stopped and looked intently at his hurried visitor,
though without much surprise."
"""I've got tea and sugar and a samovar."
"But there's no need of the
samovar, the tea is hot."
"Sit down and simply drink it."""
"""Kirillov, we lay side by side in America.... My wife has come to me ..."
I... give me the tea....
"I shall want the samovar."""
"""If your wife is here you want the samovar."
But take it later.
"I've
two."
And now take the teapot from the table.
"It's hot, boiling hot."
"Take
everything, take the sugar, all of it."
"Bread... there's plenty of bread;
all of it."
There's some veal.
"I've a rouble."""
"""Give it me, friend, I'll pay it back to-morrow!"
"Ach, Kirillov!"""
"""Is it the same wife who was in Switzerland?"
That's a good thing.
"And
your running in like this, that's a good thing too."""
"""Kirillov!"""
"cried Shatov, taking the teapot under his arm and carrying
the bread and sugar in both hands."
"""Kirillov, if... if you could get rid
of your dreadful fancies and give up your atheistic ravings... oh, what
a man you'd be, Kirillov!"""
"""One can see you love your wife after Switzerland."
"It's a good thing you
do--after Switzerland."
"When you want tea, come again."
"You can come all
night, I don't sleep at all."
There'll be a samovar.
"Take the rouble,
here it is."
"Go to your wife, I'll stay here and think about you and your
wife."""
"Marya Shatov was unmistakably pleased at her husband's haste and fell
upon the tea almost greedily, but there was no need to run for the
samovar; she drank only half a cup and swallowed a tiny piece of bread."
The veal she refused with disgust and irritation.
"""You are ill, Marie, all this is a sign of illness,"" Shatov remarked
timidly as he waited upon her."
"""Of course I'm ill, please sit down."
"Where did you get the tea if you
haven't any?"""
Shatov told her about Kirillov briefly.
She had heard something of him.
"""I know he is mad; say no more, please; there are plenty of fools."
"So
you've been in America?"
"I heard, you wrote."""
"""Yes, I..."
"I wrote to you in Paris."""
"""Enough, please talk of something else."
"Are you a Slavophil in your
convictions?"""
"""I..."
I am not exactly....
"Since I cannot be a Russian, I became a
Slavophil."""
"He smiled a wry smile with the effort of one who feels he
has made a strained and inappropriate jest."
"""Why, aren't you a Russian?"""
"""No, I'm not."""
"""Well, that's all foolishness."
"Do sit down, I entreat you."
"Why are you
all over the place?"
Do you think I am lightheaded?
Perhaps I shall be.
"You say there are only you two in the house."""
"""Yes.... Downstairs...""

""And both such clever people."
What is there downstairs?
"You said
downstairs?"""
"""No, nothing."""
"""Why nothing?"
"I want to know."""
"""I only meant to say that now we are only two in the yard, but that the
Lebyadkins used to live downstairs....""

""That woman who was murdered last night?"""
she started suddenly.
"""I heard
of it."
I heard of it as soon as I arrived.
"There was a fire here, wasn't
there?"""
"""Yes, Marie, yes, and perhaps I am doing a scoundrelly thing this moment
in forgiving the scoundrels...."" He stood up suddenly and paced about
the room, raising his arms as though in a frenzy."
But Marie had not quite understood him.
"She heard his answers
inattentively; she asked questions but did not listen."
"""Fine things are being done among you!"
"Oh, how contemptible it all is!"
What scoundrels men all are!
"But do sit down, I beg you, oh, how you
exasperate me!"""
"and she let her head sink on the pillow, exhausted."
"""Marie, I won't.... Perhaps you'll lie down, Marie?"""
"She made no answer
and closed her eyes helplessly."
Her pale face looked death-like.
"She
fell asleep almost instantly."
"Shatov looked round, snuffed the candle,
looked uneasily at her face once more, pressed his hands tight in front
of him and walked on tiptoe out of the room into the passage."
"At the
top of the stairs he stood in the corner with his face to the wall and
remained so for ten minutes without sound or movement."
"He would have
stood there longer, but he suddenly caught the sound of soft cautious
steps below."
Someone was coming up the stairs.
"Shatov remembered he had
forgotten to fasten the gate."
"""Who's there?"""
he asked in a whisper.
"The unknown visitor went on slowly
mounting the stairs without answering."
"When he reached the top he stood
still; it was impossible to see his face in the dark; suddenly Shatov
heard the cautious question:

""Ivan Shatov?"""
"Shatov said who he was, but at once held out his hand to check his
advance."
"The latter took his hand, and Shatov shuddered as though he had
touched some terrible reptile."
"""Stand here,"" he whispered quickly."
"""Don't go in, I can't receive you
just now."
My wife has come back.
"I'll fetch the candle."""
"When he returned with the candle he found a young officer standing
there; he did not know his name but he had seen him before."
"""Erkel,"" said the lad, introducing himself."
"""You've seen me at
Virginsky's."""
"""I remember; you sat writing."
"Listen,"" said Shatov in sudden excitement,
going up to him frantically, but still talking in a whisper."
"""You gave
me a sign just now when you took my hand."
"But you know I can treat all
these signals with contempt!"
I don't acknowledge them....
"I don't want
them...."
"I can throw you downstairs this minute, do you know that?"""
"""No, I know nothing about that and I don't know what you are in such a
rage about,"" the visitor answered without malice and almost ingenuously."
"""I have only to give you a message, and that's what I've come for, being
particularly anxious not to lose time."
"You have a printing press which
does not belong to you, and of which you are bound to give an account,
as you know yourself."
"I have received instructions to request you to
give it up to-morrow at seven o'clock in the evening to Liputin."
"I have
been instructed to tell you also that nothing more will be asked of
you."""
"""Nothing?"""
"""Absolutely nothing."
"Your request is granted, and you are struck off our
list."
"I was instructed to tell you that positively."""
"""Who instructed you to tell me?"""
"""Those who told me the sign."""
"""Have you come from abroad?"""
"""I..."
"I think that's no matter to you."""
"""Oh, hang it!"
"Why didn't you come before if you were told to?"""
"""I followed certain instructions and was not alone."""
"""I understand, I understand that you were not alone."
Eh... hang it!
"But
why didn't Liputin come himself?"""
"""So I shall come for you to-morrow at exactly six o'clock in the
evening, and we'll go there on foot."
"There will be no one there but us
three."""
"""Will Verhovensky be there?"""
"""No, he won't."
"Verhovensky is leaving the town at eleven o'clock
to-morrow morning."""
"""Just what I thought!"""
"Shatov whispered furiously, and he struck his
fist on his hip."
"""He's run off, the sneak!"""
He sank into agitated reflection.
"Erkel looked intently at him and
waited in silence."
"""But how will you take it?"
"You can't simply pick it up in your hands and
carry it."""
"""There will be no need to."
"You'll simply point out the place and we'll
just make sure that it really is buried there."
"We only know whereabouts
the place is, we don't know the place itself."
"And have you pointed the
place out to anyone else yet?"""
Shatov looked at him.
"""You, you, a chit of a boy like you, a silly boy like you, you too have
got caught in that net like a sheep?"
"Yes, that's just the young blood
they want!"
"Well, go along."
E-ech!
"that scoundrel's taken you all in and
run away."""
Erkel looked at him serenely and calmly but did not seem to understand.
"""Verhovensky, Verhovensky has run away!"""
Shatov growled fiercely.
"""But he is still here, he is not gone away."
"He is not going till
to-morrow,"" Erkel observed softly and persuasively."
"""I particularly
begged him to be present as a witness; my instructions all referred to
him (he explained frankly like a young and inexperienced boy)."
"But I
regret to say he did not agree on the ground of his departure, and he
really is in a hurry."""
"Shatov glanced compassionately at the simple youth again, but suddenly
gave a gesture of despair as though he thought ""they are not worth
pitying."""
"""All right, I'll come,"" he cut him short."
"""And now get away, be off."""
"""So I'll come for you at six o'clock punctually."""
"Erkel made a courteous
bow and walked deliberately downstairs."
"""Little fool!"""
Shatov could not help shouting after him from the top.
"""What is it?"""
responded the lad from the bottom.
"""Nothing, you can go."""
"""I thought you said something."""
"II

Erkel was a ""little fool"" who was only lacking in the higher form
of reason, the ruling power of the intellect; but of the lesser, the
subordinate reasoning faculties, he had plenty--even to the point of
cunning."
"Fanatically, childishly devoted to ""the cause"" or rather in
reality to Pyotr Verhovensky, he acted on the instructions given to him
when at the meeting of the quintet they had agreed and had distributed
the various duties for the next day."
"When Pyotr Stepanovitch gave him
the job of messenger, he succeeded in talking to him aside for ten
minutes."
"A craving for active service was characteristic of this shallow,
unreflecting nature, which was forever yearning to follow the lead
of another man's will, of course for the good of ""the common"" or ""the
great"" cause."
"Not that that made any difference, for little fanatics
like Erkel can never imagine serving a cause except by identifying
it with the person who, to their minds, is the expression of it."
"The
sensitive, affectionate and kind-hearted Erkel was perhaps the most
callous of Shatov's would-be murderers, and, though he had no personal
spite against him, he would have been present at his murder without the
quiver of an eyelid."
"He had been instructed, for instance, to have a
good look at Shatov's surroundings while carrying out his commission,
and when Shatov, receiving him at the top of the stairs, blurted out to
him, probably unaware in the heat of the moment, that his wife had come
back to him--Erkel had the instinctive cunning to avoid displaying the
slightest curiosity, though the idea flashed through his mind that the
fact of his wife's return was of great importance for the success of
their undertaking."
"And so it was in reality; it was only that fact that saved the
""scoundrels"" from Shatov's carrying out his intention, and at the same
time helped them ""to get rid of him."""
"To begin with, it agitated Shatov,
threw him out of his regular routine, and deprived him of his usual
clear-sightedness and caution."
"Any idea of his own danger would be the
last thing to enter his head at this moment when he was absorbed with
such different considerations."
"On the contrary, he eagerly believed that
Pyotr Verhovensky was running away the next day: it fell in exactly with
his suspicions!"
"Returning to the room he sat down again in a corner,
leaned his elbows on his knees and hid his face in his hands."
"Bitter
thoughts tormented him....

Then he would raise his head again and go on tiptoe to look at her."
"""Good God!"
"she will be in a fever by to-morrow morning; perhaps it's
begun already!"
She must have caught cold.
"She is not accustomed to this
awful climate, and then a third-class carriage, the storm, the rain, and
she has such a thin little pelisse, no wrap at all.... And to leave
her like this, to abandon her in her helplessness!"
"Her bag, too, her
bag--what a tiny, light thing, all crumpled up, scarcely weighs ten
pounds!"
"Poor thing, how worn out she is, how much she's been through!"
"She is proud, that's why she won't complain."
"But she is irritable, very
irritable."
It's illness; an angel will grow irritable in illness.
"What
a dry forehead, it must be hot--how dark she is under the eyes,
and... and yet how beautiful the oval of her face is and her rich hair,
how...""

And he made haste to turn away his eyes, to walk away as though he were
frightened at the very idea of seeing in her anything but an unhappy,
exhausted fellow-creature who needed _help_--""how could he think of
_hopes_, oh, how mean, how base is man!"""
"And he would go back to his
corner, sit down, hide his face in his hands and again sink into dreams
and reminiscences... and again he was haunted by hopes."
"""Oh, I am tired, I am tired,"" he remembered her exclamations, her
weak broken voice."
"""Good God!"
"Abandon her now, and she has only eighty
kopecks; she held out her purse, a tiny old thing!"
"She's come to look
for a job."
What does she know about jobs?
"What do they know about
Russia?"
"Why, they are like naughty children, they've nothing but their
own fancies made up by themselves, and she is angry, poor thing,
that Russia is not like their foreign dreams!"
"The luckless, innocent
creatures!..."
"It's really cold here, though."""
"He remembered that she had complained, that he had promised to heat the
stove."
"""There are logs here, I can fetch them if only I don't wake her."
But I can do it without waking her.
But what shall I do about the veal?
"When she gets up perhaps she will be hungry.... Well, that will do
later: Kirillov doesn't go to bed all night."
"What could I cover her
with, she is sleeping so soundly, but she must be cold, ah, she must be
cold!"""
"And once more he went to look at her; her dress had worked up
a little and her right leg was half uncovered to the knee."
"He suddenly
turned away almost in dismay, took off his warm overcoat, and, remaining
in his wretched old jacket, covered it up, trying not to look at it."
"A great deal of time was spent in righting the fire, stepping about
on tiptoe, looking at the sleeping woman, dreaming in the corner, then
looking at her again."
Two or three hours had passed.
"During that time
Verhovensky and Liputin had been at Kirillov's."
"At last he, too, began
to doze in the corner."
"He heard her groan; she waked up and called him;
he jumped up like a criminal."
"""Marie, I was dropping asleep.... Ah, what a wretch I am, Marie!"""
"She sat up, looking about her with wonder, seeming not to recognise
where she was, and suddenly leapt up in indignation and anger."
"""I've taken your bed, I fell asleep so tired I didn't know what I was
doing; how dared you not wake me?"
"How could you dare imagine I meant to
be a burden to you?"""
"""How could I wake you, Marie?"""
"""You could, you ought to have!"
"You've no other bed here, and I've taken
yours."
You had no business to put me into a false position.
"Or do you
suppose that I've come to take advantage of your charity?"
"Kindly get
into your bed at once and I'll lie down in the corner on some chairs."""
"""Marie, there aren't chairs enough, and there's nothing to put on them."""
"""Then simply oil the floor."
Or you'll have to lie on the floor yourself.
"I want to lie on the floor at once, at once!"""
"She stood up, tried to take a step, but suddenly a violent spasm of pain
deprived her of all power and all determination, and with a loud groan
she fell back on the bed."
"Shatov ran up, but Marie, hiding her face in
the pillow, seized his hand and gripped and squeezed it with all her
might."
This lasted a minute.
"""Marie darling, there's a doctor Frenzel living here, a friend of
mine...."
"I could run for him."""
"""Nonsense!"""
"""What do you mean by nonsense?"
"Tell me, Marie, what is it hurting you?"
For we might try fomentations... on the stomach for instance....
"I can
do that without a doctor.... Or else mustard poultices."""
"""What's this,"" she asked strangely, raising her head and looking at him
in dismay."
"""What's what, Marie?"""
"said Shatov, not understanding."
"""What are you
asking about?"
Good heavens!
"I am quite bewildered, excuse my not
understanding."""
"""Ach, let me alone; it's not your business to understand."
"And it would
be too absurd..."" she said with a bitter smile."
"""Talk to me about
something."
Walk about the room and talk.
"Don't stand over me and don't
look at me, I particularly ask you that for the five-hundredth time!"""
"Shatov began walking up and down the room, looking at the floor, and
doing his utmost not to glance at her."
"""There's--don't be angry, Marie, I entreat you--there's some veal here,
and there's tea not far off.... You had so little before."""
She made an angry gesture of disgust.
Shatov bit his tongue in despair.
"""Listen, I intend to open a bookbinding business here, on rational
co-operative principles."
"Since you live here what do you think of it,
would it be successful?"""
"""Ech, Marie, people don't read books here, and there are none here at
all."
"And are they likely to begin binding them!"""
"""Who are they?"""
"""The local readers and inhabitants generally, Marie."""
"""Well, then, speak more clearly."
"_They_ indeed, and one doesn't know who
they are."
"You don't know grammar!"""
"""It's in the spirit of the language,"" Shatov muttered."
"""Oh, get along with your spirit, you bore me."
"Why shouldn't the local
inhabitant or reader have his books bound?"""
"""Because reading books and having them bound are two different stages of
development, and there's a vast gulf between them."
"To begin with, a man
gradually gets used to reading, in the course of ages of course, but
takes no care of his books and throws them about, not thinking them
worth attention."
"But binding implies respect for books, and implies
that not only he has grown fond of reading, but that he looks upon it as
something of value."
"That period has not been reached anywhere in Russia
yet."
"In Europe books have been bound for a long while."""
"""Though that's pedantic, anyway, it's not stupid, and reminds me of the
time three years ago; you used to be rather clever sometimes three years
ago."""
She said this as disdainfully as her other capricious remarks.
"""Marie, Marie,"" said Shatov, turning to her, much moved, ""oh, Marie!"
If you only knew how much has happened in those three years!
"I heard
afterwards that you despised me for changing my convictions."
"But what
are the men I've broken with?"
"The enemies of all true life, out-of-date
Liberals who are afraid of their own independence, the flunkeys
of thought, the enemies of individuality and freedom, the decrepit
advocates of deadness and rottenness!"
"All they have to offer is
senility, a glorious mediocrity of the most bourgeois kind, contemptible
shallowness, a jealous equality, equality without individual dignity,
equality as it's understood by flunkeys or by the French in '93."
"And
the worst of it is there are swarms of scoundrels among them, swarms of
scoundrels!"""
"""Yes, there are a lot of scoundrels,"" she brought out abruptly with
painful effort."
"She lay stretched out, motionless, as though afraid
to move, with her head thrown back on the pillow, rather on one side,
staring at the ceiling with exhausted but glowing eyes."
"Her face was
pale, her lips were dry and hot."
"""You recognise it, Marie, you recognise it,"" cried Shatov."
"She tried to
shake her head, and suddenly the same spasm came over her again."
"Again
she hid her face in the pillow, and again for a full minute she squeezed
Shatov's hand till it hurt."
"He had run up, beside himself with alarm."
"""Marie, Marie!"
"But it may be very serious, Marie!"""
"""Be quiet..."
"I won't have it, I won't have it,"" she screamed almost
furiously, turning her face upwards again."
"""Don't dare to look at me
with your sympathy!"
"Walk about the room, say something, talk....""

Shatov began muttering something again, like one distraught."
"""What do you do here?"""
"she asked, interrupting him with contemptuous
impatience."
"""I work in a merchant's office."
"I could get a fair amount of money even
here if I cared to, Marie."""
"""So much the better for you....""

""Oh, don't suppose I meant anything, Marie."
"I said it without thinking."""
"""And what do you do besides?"
What are you preaching?
"You can't exist
without preaching, that's your character!"""
"""I am preaching God, Marie."""
"""In whom you don't believe yourself."
"I never could see the idea of that."""
"""Let's leave that, Marie; we'll talk of that later."""
"""What sort of person was this Marya Timofyevna here?"""
"""We'll talk of that later too, Marie."""
"""Don't dare to say such things to me!"
"Is it true that her death may have
been caused by... the wickedness... of these people?"""
"""Not a doubt of it,"" growled Shatov."
"Marie suddenly raised her head and cried out painfully:

""Don't dare speak of that to me again, don't dare to, never, never!"""
"And she fell back in bed again, overcome by the same convulsive agony;
it was the third time, but this time her groans were louder, in fact she
screamed."
"""Oh, you insufferable man!"
"Oh, you unbearable man,"" she cried, tossing
about recklessly, and pushing away Shatov as he bent over her."
"""Marie, I'll do anything you like...."
"I'll walk about and talk....""

""Surely you must see that it has begun!"""
"""What's begun, Marie?"""
"""How can I tell!"
Do I know anything about it?...
I curse myself!
"Oh,
curse it all from the beginning!"""
"""Marie, if you'd tell me what's beginning... or else I... if you don't,
what am I to make of it?"""
"""You are a useless, theoretical babbler."
"Oh, curse everything on earth!"""
"""Marie, Marie!"""
He seriously thought that she was beginning to go mad.
"""Surely you must see that I am in the agonies of childbirth,"" she said,
sitting up and gazing at him with a terrible, hysterical vindictiveness
that distorted her whole face."
"""I curse him before he is born, this
child!"""
"""Marie,"" cried Shatov, realising at last what it meant."
"""Marie... but
why didn't you tell me before."""
"He pulled himself together at once and
seized his cap with an air of vigorous determination."
"""How could I tell when I came in here?"
"Should I have come to you if I'd
known?"
I was told it would be another ten days!
Where are you going?...
Where are you going?
"You mustn't dare!"""
"""To fetch a midwife!"
I'll sell the revolver.
"We must get money before
anything else now."""
"""Don't dare to do anything, don't dare to fetch a midwife!"
"Bring a
peasant woman, any old woman, I've eighty kopecks in my purse...."
"Peasant women have babies without midwives.... And if I die, so much the
better....""

""You shall have a midwife and an old woman too."
"But how am I to leave
you alone, Marie!"""
"But reflecting that it was better to leave her alone now in spite of
her desperate state than to leave her without help later, he paid
no attention to her groans, nor her angry exclamations, but rushed
downstairs, hurrying all he could."
"III

First of all he went to Kirillov."
"It was by now about one o'clock in the
night."
Kirillov was standing in the middle of the room.
"""Kirillov, my wife is in childbirth."""
"""How do you mean?"""
"""Childbirth, bearing a child!"""
"""You... are not mistaken?"""
"""Oh, no, no, she is in agonies!"
"I want a woman, any old woman, I must
have one at once.... Can you get one now?"
"You used to have a lot of old
women....""

""Very sorry that I am no good at childbearing,"" Kirillov answered
thoughtfully; ""that is, not at childbearing, but at doing anything for
childbearing... or... no, I don't know how to say it."""
"""You mean you can't assist at a confinement yourself?"
"But that's not
what I've come for."
"An old woman, I want a woman, a nurse, a servant!"""
"""You shall have an old woman, but not directly, perhaps..."
"If you like
I'll come instead....""

""Oh, impossible; I am running to Madame Virginsky, the midwife, now."""
"""A horrid woman!"""
"""Oh, yes, Kirillov, yes, but she is the best of them all."
"Yes, it'll all
be without reverence, without gladness, with contempt, with abuse, with
blasphemy in the presence of so great a mystery, the coming of a new
creature!"
"Oh, she is cursing it already!"""
"""If you like I'll...""

""No, no, but while I'm running (oh, I'll make Madame Virginsky come),
will you go to the foot of my staircase and quietly listen?"
"But don't
venture to go in, you'll frighten her; don't go in on any account, you
must only listen... in case anything dreadful happens."
"If anything very
bad happens, then run in."""
"""I understand."
I've another rouble.
Here it is.
"I meant to have a fowl
to-morrow, but now I don't want to, make haste, run with all your might."
"There's a samovar all the night."""
"Kirillov knew nothing of the present design against Shatov, nor had he
had any idea in the past of the degree of danger that threatened him."
"He only knew that Shatov had some old scores with ""those people,""
and although he was to some extent involved with them himself through
instructions he had received from abroad (not that these were of
much consequence, however, for he had never taken any direct share in
anything), yet of late he had given it all up, having left off doing
anything especially for the ""cause,"" and devoted himself entirely to a
life of contemplation."
"Although Pyotr Stepanovitch had at the meeting
invited Liputin to go with him to Kirillov's to make sure that the
latter would take upon himself, at a given moment, the responsibility
for the ""Shatov business,"" yet in his interview with Kirillov he had
said no word about Shatov nor alluded to him in any way--probably
considering it impolitic to do so, and thinking that Kirillov could
not be relied upon."
"He put off speaking about it till next day, when it
would be all over and would therefore not matter to Kirillov; such at
least was Pyotr Stepanovitch's judgment of him."
"Liputin, too, was
struck by the fact that Shatov was not mentioned in spite of what Pyotr
Stepanovitch had promised, but he was too much agitated to protest."
"Shatov ran like a hurricane to Virginsky's house, cursing the distance
and feeling it endless."
"He had to knock a long time at Virginsky's; every one had been asleep a
long while."
"But Shatov did not scruple to bang at the shutters with
all his might."
"The dog chained up in the yard dashed about barking
furiously."
"The dogs caught it up all along the street, and there was a
regular babel of barking."
"""Why are you knocking and what do you want?"""
"Shatov heard at the window
at last Virginsky's gentle voice, betraying none of the resentment
appropriate to the ""outrage."""
"The shutter was pushed back a little and
the casement was opened."
"""Who's there, what scoundrel is it?"""
"shrilled a female voice which
betrayed all the resentment appropriate to the ""outrage."""
"It was the old
maid, Virginsky's relation."
"""I am Shatov, my wife has come back to me and she is just confined....""

""Well, let her be, get along."""
"""I've come for Arina Prohorovna; I won't go without Arina Prohorovna!"""
"""She can't attend to every one."
Practice at night is a special line.
"Take yourself off to Maksheyev's and don't dare to make that din,""
rattled the exasperated female voice."
"He could hear Virginsky checking
her; but the old maid pushed him away and would not desist."
"""I am not going away!"""
Shatov cried again.
"""Wait a little, wait a little,"" Virginsky cried at last, overpowering
the lady."
"""I beg you to wait five minutes, Shatov."
"I'll wake Arina
Prohorovna."
"Please don't knock and don't shout.... Oh, how awful it all
is!"""
"After five endless minutes, Arina Prohorovna made her appearance."
"""Has your wife come?"""
"Shatov heard her voice at the window, and to his
surprise it was not at all ill-tempered, only as usual peremptory, but
Arina Prohorovna could not speak except in a peremptory tone."
"""Yes, my wife, and she is in labour."""
"""Marya Ignatyevna?"""
"""Yes, Marya Ignatyevna."
"Of course it's Marya Ignatyevna."""
A silence followed.
Shatov waited.
He heard a whispering in the house.
"""Has she been here long?"""
Madame Virginsky asked again.
"""She came this evening at eight o'clock."
"Please make haste."""
"Again he heard whispering, as though they were consulting."
"""Listen, you
are not making a mistake?"
"Did she send you for me herself?"""
"""No, she didn't send for you, she wants a peasant woman, so as not to
burden me with expense, but don't be afraid, I'll pay you."""
"""Very good, I'll come, whether you pay or not."
"I always thought highly
of Marya Ignatyevna for the independence of her sentiments, though
perhaps she won't remember me."
"Have you got the most necessary things?"""
"""I've nothing, but I'll get everything, everything."""
"""There is something generous even in these people,"" Shatov reflected,
as he set off to Lyamshin's."
"""The convictions and the man are two very
different things, very likely I've been very unfair to them!..."
"We are
all to blame, we are all to blame... and if only all were convinced of
it!"""
"He had not to knock long at Lyamshin's; the latter, to Shatov's
surprise, opened his casement at once, jumping out of bed, barefoot
and in his night-clothes at the risk of catching cold; and he was
hypochondriacal and always anxious about his health."
"But there was
a special cause for such alertness and haste: Lyamshin had been in a
tremor all the evening, and had not been able to sleep for excitement
after the meeting of the quintet; he was haunted by the dread
of uninvited and undesired visitors."
"The news of Shatov's giving
information tormented him more than anything.... And suddenly there
was this terrible loud knocking at the window as though to justify his
fears."
"He was so frightened at seeing Shatov that he at once slammed the
casement and jumped back into bed."
"Shatov began furiously knocking and
shouting."
"""How dare you knock like that in the middle of the night?"""
"shouted
Lyamshin, in a threatening voice, though he was numb with fear, when at
least two minutes later he ventured to open the casement again, and was
at last convinced that Shatov had come alone."
"""Here's your revolver for you; take it back, give me fifteen roubles."""
"""What's the matter, are you drunk?"
"This is outrageous, I shall simply
catch cold."
"Wait a minute, I'll just throw my rug over me."""
"""Give me fifteen roubles at once."
"If you don't give it me, I'll knock
and shout till daybreak; I'll break your window-frame."""
"""And I'll shout police and you'll be taken to the lock-up."""
"""And am I dumb?"
Can't I shout 'police' too?
"Which of us has most reason
to be afraid of the police, you or I?"""
"""And you can hold such contemptible opinions!"
"I know what you are
hinting at.... Stop, stop, for God's sake don't go on knocking!"
"Upon my
word, who has money at night?"
"What do you want money for, unless you are
drunk?"""
"""My wife has come back."
"I've taken ten roubles off the price, I haven't
fired it once; take the revolver, take it this minute!"""
"Lyamshin mechanically put his hand out of the casement and took the
revolver; he waited a little, and suddenly thrusting his head out of the
casement, and with a shiver running down his spine, faltered as though
he were beside himself."
"""You are lying, your wife hasn't come back to you...."
"It's... it's
simply that you want to run away."""
"""You are a fool."
Where should I run to?
"It's for your Pyotr Verhovensky
to run away, not for me."
"I've just been to the midwife, Madame
Virginsky, and she consented at once to come to me."
You can ask them.
"My
wife is in agony; I need the money; give it me!"""
"A swarm of ideas flared up in Lyamshin's crafty mind like a shower of
fireworks."
"It all suddenly took a different colour, though still panic
prevented him from reflecting."
"""But how... you are not living with your wife?"""
"""I'll break your skull for questions like that."""
"""Oh dear, I understand, forgive me, I was struck all of a heap...."
"But I
understand, I understand... is Arina Prohorovna really coming?"
"You said
just now that she had gone?"
"You know, that's not true."
"You see, you see,
you see what lies you tell at every step."""
"""By now, she must be with my wife... don't keep me... it's not my fault
you are a fool."""
"""That's a lie, I am not a fool."
"Excuse me, I really can't...""

And utterly distraught he began shutting the casement again for the
third time, but Shatov gave such a yell that he put his head out again."
"""But this is simply an unprovoked assault!"
"What do you want of me, what
is it, what is it, formulate it?"
"And think, only think, it's the middle
of the night!"""
"""I want fifteen roubles, you sheep's-head!"""
"""But perhaps I don't care to take back the revolver."
"You have no right
to force me."
"You bought the thing and the matter is settled, and you've
no right...."
"I can't give you a sum like that in the night, anyhow."
"Where am I to get a sum like that?"""
"""You always have money."
"I've taken ten roubles off the price, but every
one knows you are a skinflint."""
"""Come the day after to-morrow, do you hear, the day after to-morrow at
twelve o'clock, and I'll give you the whole of it, that will do, won't
it?"""
Shatov knocked furiously at the window-frame for the third time.
"""Give me ten roubles, and to-morrow early the other five."""
"""No, the day after to-morrow the other five, to-morrow I swear I shan't
have it."
"You'd better not come, you'd better not come."""
"""Give me ten, you scoundrel!"""
"""Why are you so abusive."
"Wait a minute, I must light a candle; you've
broken the window.... Nobody swears like that at night."
"Here you are!"""
He held a note to him out of the window.
Shatov seized it--it was a note for five roubles.
"""On my honour I can't do more, if you were to murder me, I couldn't; the
day after to-morrow I can give you it all, but now I can do nothing."""
"""I am not going away!"""
roared Shatov.
"""Very well, take it, here's some more, see, here's some more, and I
won't give more."
"You can shout at the top of your voice, but I won't
give more, I won't, whatever happens, I won't, I won't."""
"He was in a perfect frenzy, desperate and perspiring."
"The two notes
he had just given him were each for a rouble."
"Shatov had seven roubles
altogether now."
"""Well, damn you, then, I'll come to-morrow."
"I'll thrash you, Lyamshin,
if you don't give me the other eight."""
"""You won't find me at home, you fool!"""
Lyamshin reflected quickly.
"""Stay, stay!"""
"he shouted frantically after Shatov, who was already
running off."
"""Stay, come back."
"Tell me please, is it true what you said
that your wife has come back?"""
"""Fool!"""
"cried Shatov, with a gesture of disgust, and ran home as hard as
he could."
"IV

I may mention that Anna Prohorovna knew nothing of the resolutions
that had been taken at the meeting the day before."
"On returning home
overwhelmed and exhausted, Virginsky had not ventured to tell her of the
decision that had been taken, yet he could not refrain from telling her
half--that is, all that Verhovensky had told them of the certainty of
Shatov's intention to betray them; but he added at the same time that
he did not quite believe it."
Arina Prohorovna was terribly alarmed.
"This
was why she decided at once to go when Shatov came to fetch her, though
she was tired out, as she had been hard at work at a confinement all the
night before."
"She had always been convinced that ""a wretched creature
like Shatov was capable of any political baseness,"" but the arrival of
Marya Ignatyevna put things in a different light."
"Shatov's alarm, the
despairing tone of his entreaties, the way he begged for help, clearly
showed a complete change of feeling in the traitor: a man who was ready
to betray himself merely for the sake of ruining others would, she
thought, have had a different air and tone."
"In short, Arina Prohorovna
resolved to look into the matter for herself, with her own eyes."
"Virginsky was very glad of her decision, he felt as though a
hundredweight had been lifted off him!"
"He even began to feel
hopeful: Shatov's appearance seemed to him utterly incompatible with
Verhovensky's supposition."
"Shatov was not mistaken: on getting home he found Arina Prohorovna
already with Marie."
"She had just arrived, had contemptuously dismissed
Kirillov, whom she found hanging about the foot of the stairs, had
hastily introduced herself to Marie, who had not recognised her as
her former acquaintance, found her in ""a very bad way,"" that is
ill-tempered, irritable and in ""a state of cowardly despair,"" and within
five minutes had completely silenced all her protests."
"""Why do you keep on that you don't want an expensive midwife?"""
"she was
saying at the moment when Shatov came in."
"""That's perfect nonsense,
it's a false idea arising from the abnormality of your condition."
"In the
hands of some ordinary old woman, some peasant midwife, you'd have fifty
chances of going wrong and then you'd have more bother and expense than
with a regular midwife."
How do you know I am an expensive midwife?
"You
can pay afterwards; I won't charge you much and I answer for my success;
you won't die in my hands, I've seen worse cases than yours."
"And I can
send the baby to a foundling asylum to-morrow, if you like, and then to
be brought up in the country, and that's all it will mean."
"And meantime
you'll grow strong again, take up some rational work, and in a very
short time you'll repay Shatov for sheltering you and for the expense,
which will not be so great."""
"""It's not that..."
"I've no right to be a burden....""

""Rational feelings and worthy of a citizen, but you can take my word for
it, Shatov will spend scarcely anything, if he is willing to become ever
so little a man of sound ideas instead of the fantastic person he is."
"He has only not to do anything stupid, not to raise an alarm, not to run
about the town with his tongue out."
"If we don't restrain him he will be
knocking up all the doctors of the town before the morning; he waked
all the dogs in my street."
There's no need of doctors I've said already.
I'll answer for everything.
"You can hire an old woman if you like
to wait on you, that won't cost much."
"Though he too can do something
besides the silly things he's been doing."
"He's got hands and feet, he
can run to the chemist's without offending your feelings by being too
benevolent."
As though it were a case of benevolence!
"Hasn't he brought
you into this position?"
"Didn't he make you break with the family in
which you were a governess, with the egoistic object of marrying you?"
"We
heard of it, you know... though he did run for me like one possessed and
yell so all the street could hear."
"I won't force myself upon anyone and
have come only for your sake, on the principle that all of us are bound
to hold together!"
And I told him so before I left the house.
"If you
think I am in the way, good-bye, I only hope you won't have trouble
which might so easily be averted."""
And she positively got up from the chair.
"Marie was so helpless, in such
pain, and--the truth must be confessed--so frightened of what was before
her that she dared not let her go."
"But this woman was suddenly hateful
to her, what she said was not what she wanted, there was something quite
different in Marie's soul."
"Yet the prediction that she might possibly
die in the hands of an inexperienced peasant woman overcame her
aversion."
"But she made up for it by being more exacting and more
ruthless than ever with Shatov."
"She ended by forbidding him not only to
look at her but even to stand facing her."
Her pains became more violent.
"Her curses, her abuse became more and more frantic."
"""Ech, we'll send him away,"" Arina Prohorovna rapped out."
"""I don't know
what he looks like, he is simply frightening you; he is as white as a
corpse!"
"What is it to you, tell me please, you absurd fellow?"
"What a
farce!"""
"Shatov made no reply, he made up his mind to say nothing."
"""I've seen
many a foolish father, half crazy in such cases."
"But they, at any
rate...""

""Be quiet or leave me to die!"
Don't say another word!
"I won't have it, I
won't have it!"""
screamed Marie.
"""It's impossible not to say another word, if you are not out of your
mind, as I think you are in your condition."
"We must talk of what we
want, anyway: tell me, have you anything ready?"
"You answer, Shatov, she
is incapable."""
"""Tell me what's needed?"""
"""That means you've nothing ready."""
"She reckoned up all that was quite
necessary, and one must do her the justice to say she only asked for
what was absolutely indispensable, the barest necessaries."
"Some things
Shatov had."
"Marie took out her key and held it out to him, for him to
look in her bag."
"As his hands shook he was longer than he should have
been opening the unfamiliar lock."
"Marie flew into a rage, but when Arina
Prohorovna rushed up to take the key from him, she would not allow her
on any account to look into her bag and with peevish cries and tears
insisted that no one should open the bag but Shatov."
Some things he had to fetch from Kirillov's.
"No sooner had Shatov turned
to go for them than she began frantically calling him back and was only
quieted when Shatov had rushed impetuously back from the stairs, and
explained that he should only be gone a minute to fetch something
indispensable and would be back at once."
"""Well, my lady, it's hard to please you,"" laughed Arina Prohorovna, ""one
minute he must stand with his face to the wall and not dare to look at
you, and the next he mustn't be gone for a minute, or you begin crying."
He may begin to imagine something.
"Come, come, don't be silly, don't
blubber, I was laughing, you know."""
"""He won't dare to imagine anything."""
"""Tut, tut, tut, if he didn't love you like a sheep he wouldn't run about
the streets with his tongue out and wouldn't have roused all the dogs in
the town."
"He broke my window-frame."""
"V

He found Kirillov still pacing up and down his room so preoccupied that
he had forgotten the arrival of Shatov's wife, and heard what he said
without understanding him."
"""Oh, yes!"""
"he recollected suddenly, as though tearing himself with an
effort and only for an instant from some absorbing idea, ""yes... an
old woman.... A wife or an old woman?"
"Stay a minute: a wife and an old
woman, is that it?"
I remember.
"I've been, the old woman will come, only
not just now."
Take the pillow.
Is there anything else?
"Yes.... Stay, do
you have moments of the eternal harmony, Shatov?"""
"""You know, Kirillov, you mustn't go on staying up every night."""
"Kirillov came out of his reverie and, strange to say, spoke far more
coherently than he usually did; it was clear that he had formulated it
long ago and perhaps written it down."
"""There are seconds--they come five or six at a time--when you suddenly
feel the presence of the eternal harmony perfectly attained."
"It's
something not earthly--I don't mean in the sense that it's heavenly--but
in that sense that man cannot endure it in his earthly aspect."
"He must
be physically changed or die."
"This feeling is clear and unmistakable;
it's as though you apprehend all nature and suddenly say, 'Yes, that's
right.'"
"God, when He created the world, said at the end of each day
of creation, 'Yes, it's right, it's good.'"
"It... it's not being deeply
moved, but simply joy."
"You don't forgive anything because there is no
more need of forgiveness."
"It's not that you love--oh, there's something
in it higher than love--what's most awful is that it's terribly clear
and such joy."
"If it lasted more than five seconds, the soul could
not endure it and must perish."
"In those five seconds I live through a
lifetime, and I'd give my whole life for them, because they are worth
it."
To endure ten seconds one must be physically changed.
"I think man
ought to give up having children--what's the use of children, what's the
use of evolution when the goal has been attained?"
"In the gospel it is
written that there will be no child-bearing in the resurrection, but
that men will be like the angels of the Lord."
That's a hint.
"Is your
wife bearing a child?"""
"""Kirillov, does this often happen?"""
"""Once in three days, or once a week."""
"""Don't you have fits, perhaps?"""
"""No."""
"""Well, you will."
"Be careful, Kirillov."
"I've heard that's just how fits
begin."
"An epileptic described exactly that sensation before a fit, word
for word as you've done."
"He mentioned five seconds, too, and said that
more could not be endured."
"Remember Mahomet's pitcher from which no drop
of water was spilt while he circled Paradise on his horse."
"That was a
case of five seconds too; that's too much like your eternal harmony, and
Mahomet was an epileptic."
"Be careful, Kirillov, it's epilepsy!"""
"""It won't have time,"" Kirillov smiled gently."
"VI

The night was passing."
"Shatov was sent hither and thither, abused,
called back."
Marie was reduced to the most abject terror for life.
"She
screamed that she wanted to live, that ""she must, she must,"" and was
afraid to die."
"""I don't want to, I don't want to!"""
she repeated.
"If
Arina Prohorovna had not been there, things would have gone very badly."
"By degrees she gained complete control of the patient--who began to obey
every word, every order from her like a child."
"Arina Prohorovna ruled by
sternness not by kindness, but she was first-rate at her work."
"It began
to get light... Arina Prohorovna suddenly imagined that Shatov had just
run out on to the stairs to say his prayers and began laughing."
"Marie
laughed too, spitefully, malignantly, as though such laughter relieved
her."
At last they drove Shatov away altogether.
"A damp, cold morning
dawned."
"He pressed his face to the wall in the corner just as he had
done the evening before when Erkel came."
"He was trembling like a leaf,
afraid to think, but his mind caught at every thought as it does in
dreams."
"He was continually being carried away by day-dreams, which snapped off
short like a rotten thread."
"From the room came no longer groans but
awful animal cries, unendurable, incredible."
"He tried to stop up his
ears, but could not, and he fell on his knees, repeating unconsciously,
""Marie, Marie!"""
"Then suddenly he heard a cry, a new cry, which made
Shatov start and jump up from his knees, the cry of a baby, a weak
discordant cry."
He crossed himself and rushed into the room.
"Arina
Prohorovna held in her hands a little red wrinkled creature, screaming,
and moving its little arms and legs, fearfully helpless, and looking
as though it could be blown away by a puff of wind, but screaming and
seeming to assert its full right to live."
"Marie was lying as though
insensible, but a minute later she opened her eyes, and bent a strange,
strange look on Shatov: it was something quite new, that look."
"What it
meant exactly he was not able to understand yet, but he had never known
such a look on her face before."
"""Is it a boy?"
"Is it a boy?"""
"she asked Arina Prohorovna in an exhausted
voice."
"""It is a boy,"" the latter shouted in reply, as she bound up the child."
"When she had bound him up and was about to lay him across the bed
between the two pillows, she gave him to Shatov for a minute to hold."
Marie signed to him on the sly as though afraid of Arina Prohorovna.
"He
understood at once and brought the baby to show her."
"""How... pretty he is,"" she whispered weakly with a smile."
"""Foo, what does he look like,"" Arina Prohorovna laughed gaily in
triumph, glancing at Shatov's face."
"""What a funny face!"""
"""You may be merry, Arina Prohorovna...."
"It's a great joy,"" Shatov
faltered with an expression of idiotic bliss, radiant at the phrase
Marie had uttered about the child."
"""Where does the great joy come in?"""
"said Arina Prohorovna
good-humouredly, bustling about, clearing up, and working like a
convict."
"""The mysterious coming of a new creature, a great and inexplicable
mystery; and what a pity it is, Arina Prohorovna, that you don't
understand it."""
"Shatov spoke in an incoherent, stupefied and ecstatic way."
"Something
seemed to be tottering in his head and welling up from his soul apart
from his own will."
"""There were two and now there's a third human being, a new spirit,
finished and complete, unlike the handiwork of man; a new thought and a
new love... it's positively frightening.... And there's nothing grander
in the world."""
"""Ech, what nonsense he talks!"
"It's simply a further development of
the organism, and there's nothing else in it, no mystery,"" said Arina
Prohorovna with genuine and good-humoured laughter."
"""If you talk like
that, every fly is a mystery."
"But I tell you what: superfluous people
ought not to be born."
"We must first remould everything so that they
won't be superfluous and then bring them into the world."
"As it is, we
shall have to take him to the Foundling, the day after to-morrow...."
"Though that's as it should be."""
"""I will never let him go to the Foundling,"" Shatov pronounced
resolutely, staring at the floor."
"""You adopt him as your son?"""
"""He is my son."""
"""Of course he is a Shatov, legally he is a Shatov, and there's no need
for you to pose as a humanitarian."
Men can't get on without fine words.
"There, there, it's all right, but look here, my friends,"" she added,
having finished clearing up at last, ""it's time for me to go."
"I'll come
again this morning, and again in the evening if necessary, but now,
since everything has gone off so well, I must run off to my other
patients, they've been expecting me long ago."
"I believe you got an old
woman somewhere, Shatov; an old woman is all very well, but don't you,
her tender husband, desert her; sit beside her, you may be of use; Marya
Ignatyevna won't drive you away, I fancy...."
"There, there, I was only
laughing."""
"At the gate, to which Shatov accompanied her, she added to him alone."
"""You've given me something to laugh at for the rest of my life; I shan't
charge you anything; I shall laugh at you in my sleep!"
"I have never seen
anything funnier than you last night."""
She went off very well satisfied.
"Shatov's appearance and conversation
made it as clear as daylight that this man ""was going in for being a
father and was a ninny."""
"She ran home on purpose to tell Virginsky about
it, though it was shorter and more direct to go to another patient."
"""Marie, she told you not to go to sleep for a little time, though, I
see, it's very hard for you,"" Shatov began timidly."
"""I'll sit here by
the window and take care of you, shall I?"""
"And he sat down, by the window behind the sofa so that she could not see
him."
"But before a minute had passed she called him and fretfully asked
him to arrange the pillow."
He began arranging it.
"She looked angrily at
the wall."
"""That's not right, that's not right.... What hands!"""
Shatov did it again.
"""Stoop down to me,"" she said wildly, trying hard not to look at him."
He started but stooped down.
"""More... not so... nearer,"" and suddenly her left arm was impulsively
thrown round his neck and he felt her warm moist kiss on his forehead."
"""Marie!"""
"Her lips were quivering, she was struggling with herself, but suddenly
she raised herself and said with flashing eyes:

""Nikolay Stavrogin is a scoundrel!"""
"And she fell back helplessly with
her face in the pillow, sobbing hysterically, and tightly squeezing
Shatov's hand in hers."
"From that moment she would not let him leave her; she insisted on his
sitting by her pillow."
"She could not talk much but she kept gazing at
him and smiling blissfully."
"She seemed suddenly to have become a silly
girl."
Everything seemed transformed.
"Shatov cried like a boy, then
talked of God knows what, wildly, crazily, with inspiration, kissed
her hands; she listened entranced, perhaps not understanding him, but
caressingly ruffling his hair with her weak hand, smoothing it and
admiring it."
"He talked about Kirillov, of how they would now begin ""a
new life"" for good, of the existence of God, of the goodness of all men."
... She took out the child again to gaze at it rapturously.
"""Marie,"" he cried, as he held the child in his arms, ""all the old
madness, shame, and deadness is over, isn't it?"
"Let us work hard and
begin a new life, the three of us, yes, yes!..."
"Oh, by the way, what
shall we call him, Marie?"""
"""What shall we call him?"""
"she repeated with surprise, and there was a
sudden look of terrible grief in her face."
"She clasped her hands, looked reproachfully at Shatov and hid her face
in the pillow."
"""Marie, what is it?"""
he cried with painful alarm.
"""How could you, how could you... Oh, you ungrateful man!"""
"""Marie, forgive me, Marie..."
I only asked you what his name should be.
"I
don't know....""

""Ivan, Ivan."""
She raised her flushed and tear-stained face.
"""How could
you suppose we should call him by another _horrible_ name?"""
"""Marie, calm yourself; oh, what a nervous state you are in!"""
"""That's rude again, putting it down to my nerves."
"I bet that if I'd said
his name was to be that other... horrible name, you'd have agreed
at once and not have noticed it even!"
"Oh, men, the mean ungrateful
creatures, they are all alike!"""
"A minute later, of course, they were reconciled."
"Shatov persuaded her to
have a nap."
"She fell asleep but still kept his hand in hers; she waked
up frequently, looked at him, as though afraid he would go away, and
dropped asleep again."
"Kirillov sent an old woman ""to congratulate them,"" as well as some hot
tea, some freshly cooked cutlets, and some broth and white bread for
Marya Ignatyevna."
"The patient sipped the broth greedily, the old woman
undid the baby's wrappings and swaddled it afresh, Marie made Shatov
have a cutlet too."
Time was passing.
"Shatov, exhausted, fell asleep himself in his chair,
with his head on Marie's pillow."
"So they were found by Arina Prohorovna,
who kept her word."
"She waked them up gaily, asked Marie some necessary
questions, examined the baby, and again forbade Shatov to leave her."
"Then, jesting at the ""happy couple,"" with a shade of contempt and
superciliousness she went away as well satisfied as before."
It was quite dark when Shatov waked up.
"He made haste to light the
candle and ran for the old woman; but he had hardly begun to go down the
stairs when he was struck by the sound of the soft, deliberate steps of
someone coming up towards him."
Erkel came in.
"""Don't come in,"" whispered Shatov, and impulsively seizing him by the
hand he drew him back towards the gate."
"""Wait here, I'll come directly,
I'd completely forgotten you, completely!"
"Oh, how you brought it back!"""
"He was in such haste that he did not even run in to Kirillov's, but
only called the old woman."
"Marie was in despair and indignation that ""he
could dream of leaving her alone."""
"""But,"" he cried ecstatically, ""this is the very last step!"
"And then for
a new life and we'll never, never think of the old horrors again!"""
"He somehow appeased her and promised to be back at nine o'clock; he
kissed her warmly, kissed the baby and ran down quickly to Erkel."
"They set off together to Stavrogin's park at Skvoreshniki, where, in a
secluded place at the very edge of the park where it adjoined the pine
wood, he had, eighteen months before, buried the printing press which
had been entrusted to him."
"It was a wild and deserted place, quite
hidden and at some distance from the Stavrogins' house."
"It was two or
perhaps three miles from Filipov's house."
"""Are we going to walk all the way?"
"I'll take a cab."""
"""I particularly beg you not to,"" replied Erkel."
They insisted on that.
A cabman would be a witness.
"""Well... bother!"
"I don't care, only to make an end of it."""
They walked very fast.
"""Erkel, you little boy,"" cried Shatov, ""have you ever been happy?"""
"""You seem to be very happy just now,"" observed Erkel with curiosity."
CHAPTER VI.
"A BUSY NIGHT


I

During that day Virginsky had spent two hours in running round to
see the members of the quintet and to inform them that Shatov would
certainly not give information, because his wife had come back and given
birth to a child, and no one ""who knew anything of human nature"" could
suppose that Shatov could be a danger at this moment."
"But to his
discomfiture he found none of them at home except Erkel and Lyamshin."
"Erkel listened in silence, looking candidly into his eyes, and in answer
to the direct question ""Would he go at six o'clock or not?"""
"he replied
with the brightest of smiles that ""of course he would go."""
"Lyamshin was in bed, seriously ill, as it seemed, with his head covered
with a quilt."
"He was alarmed at Virginsky's coming in, and as soon as
the latter began speaking he waved him off from under the bedclothes,
entreating him to let him alone."
"He listened to all he said about
Shatov, however, and seemed for some reason extremely struck by the news
that Virginsky had found no one at home."
"It seemed that Lyamshin
knew already (through Liputin) of Fedka's death, and hurriedly and
incoherently told Virginsky about it, at which the latter seemed struck
in his turn."
"To Virginsky's direct question, ""Should they go or not?"""
"he
began suddenly waving his hands again, entreating him to let him alone,
and saying that it was not his business, and that he knew nothing about
it."
Virginsky returned home dejected and greatly alarmed.
"It weighed upon
him that he had to hide it from his family; he was accustomed to tell
his wife everything; and if his feverish brain had not hatched a new
idea at that moment, a new plan of conciliation for further action, he
might have taken to his bed like Lyamshin."
"But this new idea sustained
him; what's more, he began impatiently awaiting the hour fixed, and set
off for the appointed spot earlier than was necessary."
"It was a very
gloomy place at the end of the huge park."
"I went there afterwards on
purpose to look at it."
"How sinister it must have looked on that chill
autumn evening!"
"It was at the edge of an old wood belonging to the
Crown."
"Huge ancient pines stood out as vague sombre blurs in the
darkness."
"It was so dark that they could hardly see each other two paces
off, but Pyotr Stepanovitch, Liputin, and afterwards Erkel, brought
lanterns with them."
"At some unrecorded date in the past a rather
absurd-looking grotto had for some reason been built here of rough
unhewn stones."
"The table and benches in the grotto had long ago decayed
and fallen."
"Two hundred paces to the right was the bank of the third
pond of the park."
"These three ponds stretched one after another for
a mile from the house to the very end of the park."
"One could scarcely
imagine that any noise, a scream, or even a shot, could reach the
inhabitants of the Stavrogins' deserted house."
"Nikolay Vsyevolodovitch's
departure the previous day and Alexey Yegorytch's absence left only five
or six people in the house, all more or less invalided, so to speak."
"In
any case it might be assumed with perfect confidence that if cries or
shouts for help were heard by any of the inhabitants of the isolated
house they would only have excited terror; no one would have moved from
his warm stove or snug shelf to give assistance."
"By twenty past six almost all of them except Erkel, who had been told
off to fetch Shatov, had turned up at the trysting-place."
"This time
Pyotr Stepanovitch was not late; he came with Tolkatchenko."
"Tolkatchenko
looked frowning and anxious; all his assumed determination and insolent
bravado had vanished."
"He scarcely left Pyotr Stepanovitch's side, and
seemed to have become all at once immensely devoted to him."
"He was
continually thrusting himself forward to whisper fussily to him, but the
latter scarcely answered him, or muttered something irritably to get rid
of him."
"Shigalov and Virginsky had arrived rather before Pyotr Stepanovitch, and
as soon as he came they drew a little apart in profound and obviously
intentional silence."
"Pyotr Stepanovitch raised his lantern and examined
them with unceremonious and insulting minuteness."
"""They mean to speak,""
flashed through his mind."
"""Isn't Lyamshin here?"""
he asked Virginsky.
"""Who said he was ill?"""
"""I am here,"" responded Lyamshin, suddenly coming from behind a tree."
"He was in a warm greatcoat and thickly muffled in a rug, so that it was
difficult to make out his face even with a lantern."
"""So Liputin is the only one not here?"""
Liputin too came out of the grotto without speaking.
"Pyotr Stepanovitch
raised the lantern again."
"""Why were you hiding in there?"
"Why didn't you come out?"""
"""I imagine we still keep the right of freedom... of our actions,""
Liputin muttered, though probably he hardly knew what he wanted to
express."
"""Gentlemen,"" said Pyotr Stepanovitch, raising his voice for the first
time above a whisper, which produced an effect, ""I think you fully
understand that it's useless to go over things again."
"Everything
was said and fully thrashed out yesterday, openly and directly."
"But perhaps--as I see from your faces--someone wants to make some
statement; in that case I beg you to make haste."
Damn it all!
"there's
not much time, and Erkel may bring him in a minute....""

""He is sure to bring him,"" Tolkatchenko put in for some reason."
"""If I am not mistaken, the printing press will be handed over, to begin
with?"""
"inquired Liputin, though again he seemed hardly to understand why
he asked the question."
"""Of course."
"Why should we lose it?"""
"said Pyotr Stepanovitch, lifting the
lantern to his face."
"""But, you see, we all agreed yesterday that it was
not really necessary to take it."
"He need only show you the exact spot
where it's buried; we can dig it up afterwards for ourselves."
"I know
that it's somewhere ten paces from a corner of this grotto."
"But, damn
it all!"
"how could you have forgotten, Liputin?"
"It was agreed that you
should meet him alone and that we should come out afterwards...."
"It's
strange that you should ask--or didn't you mean what you said?"""
Liputin kept gloomily silent.
All were silent.
"The wind shook the tops
of the pine-trees."
"""I trust, however, gentlemen, that every one will do his duty,"" Pyotr
Stepanovitch rapped out impatiently."
"""I know that Shatov's wife has come back and has given birth to a
child,"" Virginsky said suddenly, excited and gesticulating and scarcely
able to speak distinctly."
"""Knowing what human nature is, we can be sure
that now he won't give information... because he is happy...."
"So I
went to every one this morning and found no one at home, so perhaps now
nothing need be done....""

He stopped short with a catch in his breath."
"""If you suddenly became happy, Mr. Virginsky,"" said Pyotr Stepanovitch,
stepping up to him, ""would you abandon--not giving information; there's
no question of that--but any perilous public action which you had
planned before you were happy and which you regarded as a duty and
obligation in spite of the risk and loss of happiness?"""
"""No, I wouldn't abandon it!"
"I wouldn't on any account!"""
"said Virginsky
with absurd warmth, twitching all over."
"""You would rather be unhappy again than be a scoundrel?"""
"""Yes, yes.... Quite the contrary...."
"I'd rather be a complete
scoundrel... that is no... not a scoundrel at all, but on the contrary
completely unhappy rather than a scoundrel."""
"""Well then, let me tell you that Shatov looks on this betrayal as a
public duty."
"It's his most cherished conviction, and the proof of it is
that he runs some risk himself; though, of course, they will pardon him
a great deal for giving information."
"A man like that will never give up
the idea."
No sort of happiness would overcome him.
"In another day he'll
go back on it, reproach himself, and will go straight to the police."
"What's more, I don't see any happiness in the fact that his wife
has come back after three years' absence to bear him a child of
Stavrogin's."""
"""But no one has seen Shatov's letter,"" Shigalov brought out all at once,
emphatically."
"""I've seen it,"" cried Pyotr Stepanovitch."
"""It exists, and all this is
awfully stupid, gentlemen."""
"""And I protest..."" Virginsky cried, boiling over suddenly: ""I protest
with all my might...."
I want... this is what I want.
"I suggest that when
he arrives we all come out and question him, and if it's true, we induce
him to repent of it; and if he gives us his word of honour, let him
go."
In any case we must have a trial; it must be done after trial.
"We
mustn't lie in wait for him and then fall upon him."""
"""Risk the cause on his word of honour--that's the acme of stupidity!"
"Damnation, how stupid it all is now, gentlemen!"
"And a pretty part you
are choosing to play at the moment of danger!"""
"""I protest, I protest!"""
Virginsky persisted.
"""Don't bawl, anyway; we shan't hear the signal."
"Shatov, gentlemen....
(Damnation, how stupid this is now!)"
"I've told you already that Shatov
is a Slavophil, that is, one of the stupidest set of people...."
"But,
damn it all, never mind, that's no matter!"
You put me out!...
"Shatov is
an embittered man, gentlemen, and since he has belonged to the party,
anyway, whether he wanted to or no, I had hoped till the last minute
that he might have been of service to the cause and might have been
made use of as an embittered man."
"I spared him and was keeping him
in reserve, in spite of most exact instructions...."
"I've spared him a
hundred times more than he deserved!"
"But he's ended by betraying
us...."
"But, hang it all, I don't care!"
"You'd better try running away
now, any of you!"
No one of you has the right to give up the job!
"You can
kiss him if you like, but you haven't the right to stake the cause on
his word of honour!"
"That's acting like swine and spies in government
pay!"""
"""Who's a spy in government pay here?"""
Liputin filtered out.
"""You, perhaps."
"You'd better hold your tongue, Liputin; you talk for the
sake of talking, as you always do."
"All men are spies, gentlemen, who
funk their duty at the moment of danger."
"There will always be some fools
who'll run in a panic at the last moment and cry out, 'Aie, forgive
me, and I'll give them all away!'"
"But let me tell you, gentlemen,
no betrayal would win you a pardon now."
"Even if your sentence were
mitigated it would mean Siberia; and, what's more, there's no escaping
the weapons of the other side--and their weapons are sharper than the
government's."""
Pyotr Stepanovitch was furious and said more than he meant to.
"With a
resolute air Shigalov took three steps towards him."
"""Since yesterday
evening I've thought over the question,"" he began, speaking with his
usual pedantry and assurance."
"(I believe that if the earth had given way
under his feet he would not have raised his voice nor have varied one
tone in his methodical exposition.)"
"""Thinking the matter over, I've come
to the conclusion that the projected murder is not merely a waste of
precious time which might be employed in a more suitable and befitting
manner, but presents, moreover, that deplorable deviation from the
normal method which has always been most prejudicial to the cause
and has delayed its triumph for scores of years, under the guidance of
shallow thinkers and pre-eminently of men of political instead of purely
socialistic leanings."
"I have come here solely to protest against the
projected enterprise, for the general edification, intending then
to withdraw at the actual moment, which you, for some reason I don't
understand, speak of as a moment of danger to you."
"I am going--not from
fear of that danger nor from a sentimental feeling for Shatov, whom I
have no inclination to kiss, but solely because all this business from
beginning to end is in direct contradiction to my programme."
"As for my
betraying you and my being in the pay of the government, you can set
your mind completely at rest."
"I shall not betray you."""
He turned and walked away.
"""Damn it all, he'll meet them and warn Shatov!"""
"cried Pyotr
Stepanovitch, pulling out his revolver."
"They heard the click of the
trigger."
"""You may be confident,"" said Shigalov, turning once more, ""that if I
meet Shatov on the way I may bow to him, but I shall not warn him."""
"""But do you know, you may have to pay for this, Mr."
"Fourier?"""
"""I beg you to observe that I am not Fourier."
"If you mix me up with that
mawkish theoretical twaddler you simply prove that you know nothing of
my manuscript, though it has been in your hands."
"As for your vengeance,
let me tell you that it's a mistake to cock your pistol: that's
absolutely against your interests at the present moment."
"But if you
threaten to shoot me to-morrow, or the day after, you'll gain nothing by
it but unnecessary trouble."
"You may kill me, but sooner or later you'll
come to my system all the same."
"Good-bye."""
"At that instant a whistle was heard in the park, two hundred paces away
from the direction of the pond."
"Liputin at once answered, whistling also
as had been agreed the evening before."
"(As he had lost several teeth and
distrusted his own powers, he had this morning bought for a farthing
in the market a child's clay whistle for the purpose.)"
"Erkel had warned
Shatov on the way that they would whistle as a signal, so that the
latter felt no uneasiness."
"""Don't be uneasy, I'll avoid them and they won't notice me at all,""
Shigalov declared in an impressive whisper; and thereupon deliberately
and without haste he walked home through the dark park."
"Everything, to the smallest detail of this terrible affair, is now fully
known."
"To begin with, Liputin met Erkel and Shatov at the entrance
to the grotto."
"Shatov did not bow or offer him his hand, but at once
pronounced hurriedly in a loud voice:

""Well, where have you put the spade, and haven't you another lantern?"
"You needn't be afraid, there's absolutely no one here, and they wouldn't
hear at Skvoreshniki now if we fired a cannon here."
"This is the place,
here this very spot."""
"And he stamped with his foot ten paces from the end of the grotto
towards the wood."
"At that moment Tolkatchenko rushed out from behind
a tree and sprang at him from behind, while Erkel seized him by the
elbows."
Liputin attacked him from the front.
"The three of them at once
knocked him down and pinned him to the ground."
"At this point Pyotr
Stepanovitch darted up with his revolver."
"It is said that Shatov had
time to turn his head and was able to see and recognise him."
"Three
lanterns lighted up the scene."
"Shatov suddenly uttered a short and
desperate scream."
But they did not let him go on screaming.
"Pyotr
Stepanovitch firmly and accurately put his revolver to Shatov's
forehead, pressed it to it, and pulled the trigger."
"The shot seems not
to have been loud; nothing was heard at Skvoreshniki, anyway."
"Shigalov,
who was scarcely three paces away, of course heard it--he heard the
shout and the shot, but, as he testified afterwards, he did not turn nor
even stop."
Death was almost instantaneous.
"Pyotr Stepanovitch was the
only one who preserved all his faculties, but I don't think he was quite
cool."
"Squatting on his heels, he searched the murdered man's pockets
hastily, though with steady hand."
"No money was found (his purse had been
left under Marya Ignatyevna's pillow)."
"Two or three scraps of paper
of no importance were found: a note from his office, the title of some
book, and an old bill from a restaurant abroad which had been preserved,
goodness knows why, for two years in his pocket."
"Pyotr Stepanovitch
transferred these scraps of paper to his own pocket, and suddenly
noticing that they had all gathered round, were gazing at the corpse and
doing nothing, he began rudely and angrily abusing them and urging them
on."
"Tolkatchenko and Erkel recovered themselves, and running to the
grotto brought instantly from it two stones which they had got ready
there that morning."
"These stones, which weighed about twenty pounds
each, were securely tied with cord."
"As they intended to throw the body
in the nearest of the three ponds, they proceeded to tie the stones to
the head and feet respectively."
"Pyotr Stepanovitch fastened the stones
while Tolkatchenko and Erkel only held and passed them."
"Erkel was
foremost, and while Pyotr Stepanovitch, grumbling and swearing, tied the
dead man's feet together with the cord and fastened the stone to them--a
rather lengthy operation--Tolkatchenko stood holding the other stone
at arm's-length, his whole person bending forward, as it were,
deferentially, to be in readiness to hand it without delay."
"It never
once occurred to him to lay his burden on the ground in the interval."
"When at last both stones were tied on and Pyotr Stepanovitch got up from
the ground to scrutinise the faces of his companions, something strange
happened, utterly unexpected and surprising to almost every one."
"As I have said already, all except perhaps Tolkatchenko and Erkel were
standing still doing nothing."
"Though Virginsky had rushed up to Shatov
with the others he had not seized him or helped to hold him."
"Lyamshin
had joined the group after the shot had been fired."
"Afterwards,
while Pyotr Stepanovitch was busy with the corpse--for perhaps ten
minutes--none of them seemed to have been fully conscious."
"They grouped
themselves around and seemed to have felt amazement rather than anxiety
or alarm."
"Liputin stood foremost, close to the corpse."
"Virginsky stood
behind him, peeping over his shoulder with a peculiar, as it were
unconcerned, curiosity; he even stood on tiptoe to get a better view."
Lyamshin hid behind Virginsky.
"He took an apprehensive peep from time to
time and slipped behind him again at once."
"When the stones had been tied
on and Pyotr Stepanovitch had risen to his feet, Virginsky began faintly
shuddering all over, clasped his hands, and cried out bitterly at the
top of his voice:

""It's not the right thing, it's not, it's not at all!"""
"He would perhaps
have added something more to his belated exclamation, but Lyamshin did
not let him finish: he suddenly seized him from behind and squeezed him
with all his might, uttering an unnatural shriek."
"There are moments of
violent emotion, of terror, for instance, when a man will cry out in a
voice not his own, unlike anything one could have anticipated from him,
and this has sometimes a very terrible effect."
"Lyamshin gave vent to a
scream more animal than human."
"Squeezing Virginsky from behind more and
more tightly and convulsively, he went on shrieking without a pause,
his mouth wide open and his eyes starting out of his head, keeping up
a continual patter with his feet, as though he were beating a drum."
"Virginsky was so scared that he too screamed out like a madman, and
with a ferocity, a vindictiveness that one could never have expected of
Virginsky."
"He tried to pull himself away from Lyamshin, scratching and
punching him as far as he could with his arms behind him."
"Erkel at last
helped to pull Lyamshin away."
"But when, in his terror, Virginsky had
skipped ten paces away from him, Lyamshin, catching sight of Pyotr
Stepanovitch, began yelling again and flew at him."
"Stumbling over
the corpse, he fell upon Pyotr Stepanovitch, pressing his head to
the latter's chest and gripping him so tightly in his arms that Pyotr
Stepanovitch, Tolkatchenko, and Liputin could all of them do nothing
at the first moment."
"Pyotr Stepanovitch shouted, swore, beat him on
the head with his fists."
"At last, wrenching himself away, he drew his
revolver and put it in the open mouth of Lyamshin, who was still yelling
and was by now tightly held by Tolkatchenko, Erkel, and Liputin."
"But
Lyamshin went on shrieking in spite of the revolver."
"At last Erkel,
crushing his silk handkerchief into a ball, deftly thrust it into his
mouth and the shriek ceased."
"Meantime Tolkatchenko tied his hands with
what was left of the rope."
"""It's very strange,"" said Pyotr Stepanovitch, scrutinising the madman
with uneasy wonder."
He was evidently struck.
"""I expected something very
different from him,"" he added thoughtfully."
They left Erkel in charge of him for a time.
"They had to make haste to
get rid of the corpse: there had been so much noise that someone might
have heard."
"Tolkatchenko and Pyotr Stepanovitch took up the lanterns
and lifted the corpse by the head, while Liputin and Virginsky took the
feet, and so they carried it away."
"With the two stones it was a heavy
burden, and the distance was more than two hundred paces."
"Tolkatchenko
was the strongest of them."
"He advised them to keep in step, but no one
answered him and they all walked anyhow."
"Pyotr Stepanovitch walked
on the right and, bending forward, carried the dead man's head on
his shoulder while with the left hand he supported the stone."
"As
Tolkatchenko walked more than half the way without thinking of helping
him with the stone, Pyotr Stepanovitch at last shouted at him with an
oath."
"It was a single, sudden shout."
"They all went on carrying the body
in silence, and it was only when they reached the pond that Virginsky,
stooping under his burden and seeming to be exhausted by the weight of
it, cried out again in the same loud and wailing voice:

""It's not the right thing, no, no, it's not the right thing!"""
"The place to which they carried the dead man at the extreme end of the
rather large pond, which was the farthest of the three from the house,
was one of the most solitary and unfrequented spots in the park,
especially at this late season of the year."
"At that end the pond was
overgrown with weeds by the banks."
"They put down the lantern, swung the
corpse and threw it into the pond."
"They heard a muffled and prolonged
splash."
"Pyotr Stepanovitch raised the lantern and every one followed his
example, peering curiously to see the body sink, but nothing could
be seen: weighted with the two stones, the body sank at once."
"The big
ripples spread over the surface of the water and quickly passed away."
"It
was over."
"Virginsky went off with Erkel, who before giving up Lyamshin to
Tolkatchenko brought him to Pyotr Stepanovitch, reporting to the
latter that Lyamshin had come to his senses, was penitent and begged
forgiveness, and indeed had no recollection of what had happened to him."
"Pyotr Stepanovitch walked off alone, going round by the farther side of
the pond, skirting the park."
This was the longest way.
"To his surprise
Liputin overtook him before he got half-way home."
"""Pyotr Stepanovitch!"
Pyotr Stepanovitch!
"Lyamshin will give
information!"""
"""No, he will come to his senses and realise that he will be the first to
go to Siberia if he did."
No one will betray us now.
"Even you won't."""
"""What about you?"""
"""No fear!"
"I'll get you all out of the way the minute you attempt to turn
traitors, and you know that."
But you won't turn traitors.
"Have you run a
mile and a half to tell me that?"""
"""Pyotr Stepanovitch, Pyotr Stepanovitch, perhaps we shall never meet
again!"""
"""What's put that into your head?"""
"""Only tell me one thing."""
"""Well, what?"
"Though I want you to take yourself off."""
"""One question, but answer it truly: are we the only quintet in the
world, or is it true that there are hundreds of others?"
"It's a question
of the utmost importance to me, Pyotr Stepanovitch."""
"""I see that from the frantic state you are in."
"But do you know, Liputin,
you are more dangerous than Lyamshin?"""
"""I know, I know; but the answer, your answer!"""
"""You are a stupid fellow!"
"I should have thought it could make no
difference to you now whether it's the only quintet or one of a
thousand."""
"""That means it's the only one!"
"I was sure of it..."" cried Liputin."
"""I always knew it was the only one, I knew it all along."""
"And without
waiting for any reply he turned and quickly vanished into the darkness."
Pyotr Stepanovitch pondered a little.
"""No, no one will turn traitor,"" he concluded with decision, ""but the
group must remain a group and obey, or I'll... What a wretched set they
are though!"""
"II

He first went home, and carefully, without haste, packed his trunk."
"At
six o'clock in the morning there was a special train from the town."
"This early morning express only ran once a week, and was only a recent
experiment."
"Though Pyotr Stepanovitch had told the members of the
quintet that he was only going to be away for a short time in the
neighbourhood, his intentions, as appeared later, were in reality
very different."
"Having finished packing, he settled accounts with his
landlady to whom he had previously given notice of his departure, and
drove in a cab to Erkel's lodgings, near the station."
"And then just upon
one o'clock at night he walked to Kirillov's, approaching as before by
Fedka's secret way."
Pyotr Stepanovitch was in a painful state of mind.
"Apart from other
extremely grave reasons for dissatisfaction (he was still unable to
learn anything of Stavrogin), he had, it seems--for I cannot assert
it for a fact--received in the course of that day, probably from
Petersburg, secret information of a danger awaiting him in the immediate
future."
"There are, of course, many legends in the town relating to this
period; but if any facts were known, it was only to those immediately
concerned."
"I can only surmise as my own conjecture that Pyotr
Stepanovitch may well have had affairs going on in other neighbourhoods
as well as in our town, so that he really may have received such a
warning."
"I am convinced, indeed, in spite of Liputin's cynical and
despairing doubts, that he really had two or three other quintets;
for instance, in Petersburg and Moscow, and if not quintets at least
colleagues and correspondents, and possibly was in very curious
relations with them."
"Not more than three days after his departure an
order for his immediate arrest arrived from Petersburg--whether in
connection with what had happened among us, or elsewhere, I don't know."
"This order only served to increase the overwhelming, almost panic terror
which suddenly came upon our local authorities and the society of
the town, till then so persistently frivolous in its attitude, on
the discovery of the mysterious and portentous murder of the student
Shatov--the climax of the long series of senseless actions in
our midst--as well as the extremely mysterious circumstances that
accompanied that murder."
"But the order came too late: Pyotr Stepanovitch
was already in Petersburg, living under another name, and, learning
what was going on, he made haste to make his escape abroad...."
"But I am
anticipating in a shocking way."
"He went in to Kirillov, looking ill-humoured and quarrelsome."
"Apart from
the real task before him, he felt, as it were, tempted to satisfy some
personal grudge, to avenge himself on Kirillov for something."
"Kirillov
seemed pleased to see him; he had evidently been expecting him a long
time with painful impatience."
"His face was paler than usual; there was a
fixed and heavy look in his black eyes."
"""I thought you weren't coming,"" he brought out drearily from his corner
of the sofa, from which he had not, however, moved to greet him."
"Pyotr Stepanovitch stood before him and, before uttering a word, looked
intently at his face."
"""Everything is in order, then, and we are not drawing back from our
resolution."
"Bravo!"""
He smiled an offensively patronising smile.
"""But,
after all,"" he added with unpleasant jocosity, ""if I am behind my time,
it's not for you to complain: I made you a present of three hours."""
"""I don't want extra hours as a present from you, and you can't make me a
present... you fool!"""
"""What?"""
"Pyotr Stepanovitch was startled, but instantly controlled
himself."
"""What huffiness!"
"So we are in a savage temper?"""
"he rapped
out, still with the same offensive superciliousness."
"""At such a moment
composure is what you need."
"The best thing you can do is to consider
yourself a Columbus and me a mouse, and not to take offence at anything
I say."
"I gave you that advice yesterday."""
"""I don't want to look upon you as a mouse."""
"""What's that, a compliment?"
"But the tea is cold--and that shows that
everything is topsy-turvy."
Bah!
"But I see something in the window, on a
plate."""
He went to the window.
"""Oh oh, boiled chicken and rice!..."
"But
why haven't you begun upon it yet?"
"So we are in such a state of mind
that even chicken...""

""I've dined, and it's not your business."
"Hold your tongue!"""
"""Oh, of course; besides, it's no consequence--though for me at the
moment it is of consequence."
"Only fancy, I scarcely had any dinner, and
so if, as I suppose, that chicken is not wanted now..."
"eh?"""
"""Eat it if you can."""
"""Thank you, and then I'll have tea."""
"He instantly settled himself at the other end of the sofa and fell upon
the chicken with extraordinary greediness; at the same time he kept a
constant watch on his victim."
"Kirillov looked at him fixedly with angry
aversion, as though unable to tear himself away."
"""I say, though,"" Pyotr Stepanovitch fired off suddenly, while he still
went on eating, ""what about our business?"
"We are not crying off, are we?"
"How about that document?"""
"""I've decided in the night that it's nothing to me."
I'll write it.
"About
the manifestoes?"""
"""Yes, about the manifestoes too."
But I'll dictate it.
"Of course, that's
nothing to you."
"Can you possibly mind what's in the letter at such a
moment?"""
"""That's not your business."""
"""It's not mine, of course."
"It need only be a few lines, though: that you
and Shatov distributed the manifestoes and with the help of Fedka, who
hid in your lodgings."
"This last point about Fedka and your lodgings is
very important--the most important of all, indeed."
"You see, I am talking
to you quite openly."""
"""Shatov?"
Why Shatov?
"I won't mention Shatov for anything."""
"""What next!"
What is it to you?
"You can't hurt him now."""
"""His wife has come back to him."
"She has waked up and has sent to ask me
where he is."""
"""She has sent to ask you where he is?"
H'm... that's unfortunate.
"She may
send again; no one ought to know I am here."""
Pyotr Stepanovitch was uneasy.
"""She won't know, she's gone to sleep again."
"There's a midwife with her,
Arina Virginsky."""
"""So that's how it was.... She won't overhear, I suppose?"
"I say, you'd
better shut the front door."""
"""She won't overhear anything."
"And if Shatov comes I'll hide you in
another room."""
"""Shatov won't come; and you must write that you quarrelled with him
because he turned traitor and informed the police... this evening...
and caused his death."""
"""He is dead!"""
"cried Kirillov, jumping up from the sofa."
"""He died at seven o'clock this evening, or rather, at seven o'clock
yesterday evening, and now it's one o'clock."""
"""You have killed him!..."
"And I foresaw it yesterday!"""
"""No doubt you did!"
"With this revolver here."""
"(He drew out his revolver
as though to show it, but did not put it back again and still held it in
his right hand as though in readiness.)"
"""You are a strange man, though,
Kirillov; you knew yourself that the stupid fellow was bound to end
like this."
What was there to foresee in that?
"I made that as plain as
possible over and over again."
"Shatov was meaning to betray us; I was
watching him, and it could not be left like that."
"And you too had
instructions to watch him; you told me so yourself three weeks ago....""

""Hold your tongue!"
"You've done this because he spat in your face in
Geneva!"""
"""For that and for other things too--for many other things; not from
spite, however."
Why do you jump up?
Why look like that?
"Oh oh, so that's
it, is it?"""
He jumped up and held out his revolver before him.
"Kirillov had suddenly
snatched up from the window his revolver, which had been loaded and put
ready since the morning."
"Pyotr Stepanovitch took up his position and
aimed his weapon at Kirillov."
The latter laughed angrily.
"""Confess, you scoundrel, that you brought your revolver because I might
shoot you...."
"But I shan't shoot you... though... though...""

And again he turned his revolver upon Pyotr Stepanovitch, as it were
rehearsing, as though unable to deny himself the pleasure of imagining
how he would shoot him."
"Pyotr Stepanovitch, holding his ground, waited
for him, waited for him till the last minute without pulling the
trigger, at the risk of being the first to get a bullet in his head: it
might well be expected of ""the maniac."""
"But at last ""the maniac"" dropped
his hand, gasping and trembling and unable to speak."
"""You've played your little game and that's enough."""
"Pyotr Stepanovitch,
too, dropped his weapon."
"""I knew it was only a game; only you ran a
risk, let me tell you: I might have fired."""
"And he sat down on the sofa with a fair show of composure and poured
himself out some tea, though his hand trembled a little."
"Kirillov laid
his revolver on the table and began walking up and down."
"""I won't write that I killed Shatov... and I won't write anything now."
"You won't have a document!"""
"""I shan't?"""
"""No, you won't."""
"""What meanness and what stupidity!"""
"Pyotr Stepanovitch turned green with
resentment."
"""I foresaw it, though."
"You've not taken me by surprise, let
me tell you."
"As you please, however."
"If I could make you do it by force,
I would."
"You are a scoundrel, though."""
"Pyotr Stepanovitch was more and
more carried away and unable to restrain himself."
"""You asked us for
money out there and promised us no end of things...."
"I won't go away
with nothing, however: I'll see you put the bullet through your brains
first, anyway."""
"""I want you to go away at once."""
Kirillov stood firmly before him.
"""No, that's impossible."""
Pyotr Stepanovitch took up his revolver again.
"""Now in your spite and cowardice you may think fit to put it off and to
turn traitor to-morrow, so as to get money again; they'll pay you for
that, of course."
"Damn it all, fellows like you are capable of anything!"
"Only don't trouble yourself; I've provided for all contingencies: I am
not going till I've dashed your brains out with this revolver, as I did
to that scoundrel Shatov, if you are afraid to do it yourself and put
off your intention, damn you!"""
"""You are set on seeing my blood, too?"""
"""I am not acting from spite; let me tell you, it's nothing to me."
"I am
doing it to be at ease about the cause."
"One can't rely on men; you see
that for yourself."
"I don't understand what fancy possesses you to put
yourself to death."
"It wasn't my idea; you thought of it yourself before
I appeared, and talked of your intention to the committee abroad before
you said anything to me."
"And you know, no one has forced it out of you;
no one of them knew you, but you came to confide in them yourself, from
sentimentalism."
"And what's to be done if a plan of action here, which
can't be altered now, was founded upon that with your consent and upon
your suggestion?..."
"your suggestion, mind that!"
"You have put yourself
in a position in which you know too much."
"If you are an ass and go off
to-morrow to inform the police, that would be rather a disadvantage to
us; what do you think about it?"
"Yes, you've bound yourself; you've given
your word, you've taken money."
"That you can't deny....""

Pyotr Stepanovitch was much excited, but for some time past Kirillov
had not been listening."
"He paced up and down the room, lost in thought
again."
"""I am sorry for Shatov,"" he said, stopping before Pyotr Stepanovitch
again."
"""Why so?"
"I am sorry, if that's all, and do you suppose...""

""Hold your tongue, you scoundrel,"" roared Kirillov, making an alarming
and unmistakable movement; ""I'll kill you."""
"""There, there, there!"
"I told a lie, I admit it; I am not sorry at all."
"Come, that's enough, that's enough."""
"Pyotr Stepanovitch started up
apprehensively, putting out his hand."
Kirillov subsided and began walking up and down again.
"""I won't put it off; I want to kill myself now: all are scoundrels."""
"""Well, that's an idea; of course all are scoundrels; and since life is a
beastly thing for a decent man...""

""Fool, I am just such a scoundrel as you, as all, not a decent man."
"There's never been a decent man anywhere."""
"""He's guessed the truth at last!"
"Can you, Kirillov, with your sense,
have failed to see till now that all men are alike, that there are none
better or worse, only some are stupider, than others, and that if all
are scoundrels (which is nonsense, though) there oughtn't to be any
people that are not?"""
"""Ah!"
"Why, you are really in earnest?"""
"Kirillov looked at him with some
wonder."
"""You speak with heat and simply.... Can it be that even fellows
like you have convictions?"""
"""Kirillov, I've never been able to understand why you mean to kill
yourself."
I only know it's from conviction... strong conviction.
"But
if you feel a yearning to express yourself, so to say, I am at your
service.... Only you must think of the time."""
"""What time is it?"""
"""Oh oh, just two."""
"Pyotr Stepanovitch looked at his watch and lighted a
cigarette."
"""It seems we can come to terms after all,"" he reflected."
"""I've nothing to say to you,"" muttered Kirillov."
"""I remember that something about God comes into it... you explained it
to me once--twice, in fact."
"If you stopped yourself, you become God;
that's it, isn't it?"""
"""Yes, I become God."""
Pyotr Stepanovitch did not even smile; he waited.
"Kirillov looked at him
subtly."
"""You are a political impostor and intriguer."
"You want to lead me on into
philosophy and enthusiasm and to bring about a reconciliation so as to
disperse my anger, and then, when I am reconciled with you, beg from me
a note to say I killed Shatov."""
Pyotr Stepanovitch answered with almost natural frankness.
"""Well, supposing I am such a scoundrel."
"But at the last moments does
that matter to you, Kirillov?"
What are we quarrelling about?
"Tell me,
please."
You are one sort of man and I am another--what of it?
"And what's
more, we are both of us...""

""Scoundrels."""
"""Yes, scoundrels if you like."
"But you know that that's only words."""
"""All my life I wanted it not to be only words."
"I lived because I did not
want it to be."
"Even now every day I want it to be not words."""
"""Well, every one seeks to be where he is best off."
"The fish... that is,
every one seeks his own comfort, that's all."
"That's been a commonplace
for ages and ages."""
"""Comfort, do you say?"""
"""Oh, it's not worth while quarrelling over words."""
"""No, you were right in what you said; let it be comfort."
"God is
necessary and so must exist."""
"""Well, that's all right, then."""
"""But I know He doesn't and can't."""
"""That's more likely."""
"""Surely you must understand that a man with two such ideas can't go on
living?"""
"""Must shoot himself, you mean?"""
"""Surely you must understand that one might shoot oneself for that
alone?"
"You don't understand that there may be a man, one man out of your
thousands of millions, one man who won't bear it and does not want to."""
"""All I understand is that you seem to be hesitating.... That's very
bad."""
"""Stavrogin, too, is consumed by an idea,"" Kirillov said gloomily, pacing
up and down the room."
He had not noticed the previous remark.
"""What?"""
Pyotr Stepanovitch pricked up his ears.
"""What idea?"
"Did he tell
you something himself?"""
"""No, I guessed it myself: if Stavrogin has faith, he does not believe
that he has faith."
"If he hasn't faith, he does not believe that he
hasn't."""
"""Well, Stavrogin has got something else worse than that in his head,""
Pyotr Stepanovitch muttered peevishly, uneasily watching the turn the
conversation had taken and the pallor of Kirillov."
"""Damn it all, he won't shoot himself!"""
he was thinking.
"""I always
suspected it; it's a maggot in the brain and nothing more; what a rotten
lot of people!"""
"""You are the last to be with me; I shouldn't like to part on bad terms
with you,"" Kirillov vouchsafed suddenly."
Pyotr Stepanovitch did not answer at once.
"""Damn it all, what is it
now?"""
he thought again.
"""I assure you, Kirillov, I have nothing against you personally as a man,
and always...""

""You are a scoundrel and a false intellect."
"But I am just the same as
you are, and I will shoot myself while you will remain living."""
"""You mean to say, I am so abject that I want to go on living."""
"He could not make up his mind whether it was judicious to keep up such
a conversation at such a moment or not, and resolved ""to be guided by
circumstances."""
"But the tone of superiority and of contempt for him,
which Kirillov had never disguised, had always irritated him, and
now for some reason it irritated him more than ever--possibly because
Kirillov, who was to die within an hour or so (Pyotr Stepanovitch still
reckoned upon this), seemed to him, as it were, already only half a man,
some creature whom he could not allow to be haughty."
"""You seem to be boasting to me of your shooting yourself."""
"""I've always been surprised at every one's going on living,"" said
Kirillov, not hearing his remark."
"""H'm!"
"Admitting that's an idea, but...""

""You ape, you assent to get the better of me."
"Hold your tongue; you
won't understand anything."
"If there is no God, then I am God."""
"""There, I could never understand that point of yours: why are you God?"""
"""If God exists, all is His will and from His will I cannot escape."
"If
not, it's all my will and I am bound to show self-will."""
"""Self-will?"
"But why are you bound?"""
"""Because all will has become mine."
"Can it be that no one in the whole
planet, after making an end of God and believing in his own will, will
dare to express his self-will on the most vital point?"
"It's like a
beggar inheriting a fortune and being afraid of it and not daring to
approach the bag of gold, thinking himself too weak to own it."
"I want to
manifest my self-will."
"I may be the only one, but I'll do it."""
"""Do it by all means."""
"""I am bound to shoot myself because the highest point of my self-will is
to kill myself with my own hands."""
"""But you won't be the only one to kill yourself; there are lots of
suicides."""
"""With good cause."
"But to do it without any cause at all, simply for
self-will, I am the only one."""
"""He won't shoot himself,"" flashed across Pyotr Stepanovitch's mind
again."
"""Do you know,"" he observed irritably, ""if I were in your place I should
kill someone else to show my self-will, not myself."
"You might be of
use."
"I'll tell you whom, if you are not afraid."
"Then you needn't shoot
yourself to-day, perhaps."
"We may come to terms."""
"""To kill someone would be the lowest point of self-will, and you show
your whole soul in that."
"I am not you: I want the highest point and I'll
kill myself."""
"""He's come to it of himself,"" Pyotr Stepanovitch muttered malignantly."
"""I am bound to show my unbelief,"" said Kirillov, walking about the room."
"""I have no higher idea than disbelief in God."
"I have all the history of
mankind on my side."
"Man has done nothing but invent God so as to go on
living, and not kill himself; that's the whole of universal history up
till now."
"I am the first one in the whole history of mankind who would
not invent God."
"Let them know it once for all."""
"""He won't shoot himself,"" Pyotr Stepanovitch thought anxiously."
"""Let whom know it?"""
"he said, egging him on."
"""It's only you and me here;
you mean Liputin?"""
"""Let every one know; all will know."
"There is nothing secret that will
not be made known."
"_He_ said so."""
"And he pointed with feverish enthusiasm to the image of the Saviour,
before which a lamp was burning."
"Pyotr Stepanovitch lost his temper
completely."
"""So you still believe in Him, and you've lighted the lamp; 'to be on the
safe side,' I suppose?"""
The other did not speak.
"""Do you know, to my thinking, you believe perhaps more thoroughly than
any priest."""
"""Believe in whom?"
"In _Him?_ Listen."""
"Kirillov stood still, gazing before
him with fixed and ecstatic look."
"""Listen to a great idea: there was a
day on earth, and in the midst of the earth there stood three crosses."
"One on the Cross had such faith that he said to another, 'To-day thou
shalt be with me in Paradise.'"
"The day ended; both died and passed away
and found neither Paradise nor resurrection."
"His words did not come
true."
"Listen: that Man was the loftiest of all on earth, He was that
which gave meaning to life."
"The whole planet, with everything on it, is
mere madness without that Man."
"There has never been any like Him before
or since, never, up to a miracle."
"For that is the miracle, that there
never was or never will be another like Him."
"And if that is so, if
the laws of nature did not spare even Him, have not spared even their
miracle and made even Him live in a lie and die for a lie, then all the
planet is a lie and rests on a lie and on mockery."
"So then, the very
laws of the planet are a lie and the vaudeville of devils."
"What is there
to live for?"
"Answer, if you are a man."""
"""That's a different matter."
"It seems to me you've mixed up two different
causes, and that's a very unsafe thing to do."
"But excuse me, if you are
God?"
"If the lie were ended and if you realised that all the falsity
comes from the belief in that former God?"""
"""So at last you understand!"""
cried Kirillov rapturously.
"""So it can be
understood if even a fellow like you understands."
"Do you understand now
that the salvation for all consists in proving this idea to every one?"
Who will prove it?
I!
"I can't understand how an atheist could know that
there is no God and not kill himself on the spot."
"To recognise that
there is no God and not to recognise at the same instant that one is God
oneself is an absurdity, else one would certainly kill oneself."
"If you
recognise it you are sovereign, and then you won't kill yourself but
will live in the greatest glory."
"But one, the first, must kill himself,
for else who will begin and prove it?"
"So I must certainly kill myself,
to begin and prove it."
"Now I am only a god against my will and I am
unhappy, because I am bound to assert my will."
"All are unhappy because
all are afraid to express their will."
"Man has hitherto been so unhappy
and so poor because he has been afraid to assert his will in the
highest point and has shown his self-will only in little things, like a
schoolboy."
"I am awfully unhappy, for I'm awfully afraid."
"Terror is the
curse of man...."
"But I will assert my will, I am bound to believe that
I don't believe."
"I will begin and will make an end of it and open the
door, and will save."
"That's the only thing that will save mankind and
will re-create the next generation physically; for with his present
physical nature man can't get on without his former God, I believe."
"For
three years I've been seeking for the attribute of my godhead and I've
found it; the attribute of my godhead is self-will!"
"That's all I can
do to prove in the highest point my independence and my new terrible
freedom."
For it is very terrible.
"I am killing myself to prove my
independence and my new terrible freedom."""
"His face was unnaturally pale, and there was a terribly heavy look in
his eyes."
He was like a man in delirium.
"Pyotr Stepanovitch thought he
would drop on to the floor."
"""Give me the pen!"""
"Kirillov cried suddenly, quite unexpectedly, in a
positive frenzy."
"""Dictate; I'll sign anything."
"I'll sign that I killed
Shatov even."
Dictate while it amuses me.
"I am not afraid of what the
haughty slaves will think!"
"You will see for yourself that all that is
secret shall be made manifest!"
And you will be crushed....
"I believe, I
believe!"""
"Pyotr Stepanovitch jumped up from his seat and instantly handed him an
inkstand and paper, and began dictating, seizing the moment, quivering
with anxiety."
"""I, Alexey Kirillov, declare...""

""Stay; I won't!"
"To whom am I declaring it?"""
Kirillov was shaking as though he were in a fever.
"This declaration and
the sudden strange idea of it seemed to absorb him entirely, as though
it were a means of escape by which his tortured spirit strove for a
moment's relief."
"""To whom am I declaring it?"
"I want to know to whom?"""
"""To no one, every one, the first person who reads it."
Why define it?
"The
whole world!"""
"""The whole world!"
Bravo!
And I won't have any repentance.
"I don't want
penitence and I don't want it for the police!"""
"""No, of course, there's no need of it, damn the police!"
"Write, if you
are in earnest!"""
Pyotr Stepanovitch cried hysterically.
"""Stay!"
"I want to put at the top a face with the tongue out."""
"""Ech, what nonsense,"" cried Pyotr Stepanovitch crossly, ""you can express
all that without the drawing, by--the tone."""
"""By the tone?"
That's true.
"Yes, by the tone, by the tone of it."
"Dictate,
the tone."""
"""I, Alexey Kirillov,"" Pyotr Stepanovitch dictated firmly and
peremptorily, bending over Kirillov's shoulder and following every
letter which the latter formed with a hand trembling with excitement,
""I, Kirillov, declare that to-day, the --th October, at about eight
o'clock in the evening, I killed the student Shatov in the park for
turning traitor and giving information of the manifestoes and of Fedka,
who has been lodging with us for ten days in Filipov's house."
"I am
shooting myself to-day with my revolver, not because I repent and am
afraid of you, but because when I was abroad I made up my mind to put an
end to my life."""
"""Is that all?"""
cried Kirillov with surprise and indignation.
"""Not another word,"" cried Pyotr Stepanovitch, waving his hand, attempting
to snatch the document from him."
"""Stay."""
Kirillov put his hand firmly on the paper.
"""Stay, it's nonsense!"
I want to say with whom I killed him.
Why Fedka?
"And what about the
fire?"
"I want it all and I want to be abusive in tone, too, in tone!"""
"""Enough, Kirillov, I assure you it's enough,"" cried Pyotr Stepanovitch
almost imploringly, trembling lest he should tear up the paper; ""that
they may believe you, you must say it as obscurely as possible, just
like that, simply in hints."
"You must only give them a peep of the truth,
just enough to tantalise them."
"They'll tell a story better than ours,
and of course they'll believe themselves more than they would us; and
you know, it's better than anything--better than anything!"
"Let me have
it, it's splendid as it is; give it to me, give it to me!"""
And he kept trying to snatch the paper.
"Kirillov listened open-eyed and
appeared to be trying to reflect, but he seemed beyond understanding
now."
"""Damn it all,"" Pyotr Stepanovitch cried all at once, ill-humouredly, ""he
hasn't signed it!"
Why are you staring like that?
"Sign!"""
"""I want to abuse them,"" muttered Kirillov."
"He took the pen, however, and
signed."
"""I want to abuse them."""
"""Write _'Vive la république,'_ and that will be enough."""
"""Bravo!"""
Kirillov almost bellowed with delight.
"""_'Vive la république
démocratique sociale et universelle ou la mort!"
"'_ No, no, that's not it."
"_'Liberté, égalité, fraternité ou la mort."
"'_ There, that's better, that's
better."""
He wrote it gleefully under his signature.
"""Enough, enough,"" repeated Pyotr Stepanovitch."
"""Stay, a little more."
"I'll sign it again in French, you know."
"'_De
Kirillov, gentilhomme russe et citoyen du monde._' Ha ha!"""
"He went off
in a peal of laughter."
"""No, no, no; stay."
"I've found something better
than all."
Eureka!
"_'Gentilhomme, séminariste russe et citoyen du monde
civilisé!"
"'_ That's better than any...."" He jumped up from the sofa
and suddenly, with a rapid gesture, snatched up the revolver from the
window, ran with it into the next room, and closed the door behind him."
"Pyotr Stepanovitch stood for a moment, pondering and gazing at the door."
"""If he does it at once, perhaps he'll do it, but if he begins thinking,
nothing will come of it."""
"Meanwhile he took up the paper, sat down, and looked at it again."
"The
wording of the document pleased him again."
"""What's needed for the moment?"
"What's wanted is to throw them all off
the scent and keep them busy for a time."
The park?
"There's no park in
the town and they'll guess its Skvoreshniki of themselves."
"But while
they are arriving at that, time will be passing; then the search will
take time too; then when they find the body it will prove that the story
is true, and it will follow that's it all true, that it's true about
Fedka too."
"And Fedka explains the fire, the Lebyadkins; so that it was
all being hatched here, at Filipov's, while they overlooked it and saw
nothing--that will quite turn their heads!"
"They will never think of
the quintet; Shatov and Kirillov and Fedka and Lebyadkin, and why they
killed each other--that will be another question for them."
"Oh, damn it
all, I don't hear the shot!"""
"Though he had been reading and admiring the wording of it, he had been
listening anxiously all the time, and he suddenly flew into a rage."
"He
looked anxiously at his watch; it was getting late and it was fully ten
minutes since Kirillov had gone out.... Snatching up the candle, he went
to the door of the room where Kirillov had shut himself up."
"He was just
at the door when the thought struck him that the candle had burnt out,
that it would not last another twenty minutes, and that there was no
other in the room."
"He took hold of the handle and listened warily; he
did not hear the slightest sound."
"He suddenly opened the door and lifted
up the candle: something uttered a roar and rushed at him."
"He slammed
the door with all his might and pressed his weight against it; but all
sounds died away and again there was deathlike stillness."
"He stood for a long while irresolute, with the candle in his hand."
"He
had been able to see very little in the second he held the door open,
but he had caught a glimpse of the face of Kirillov standing at the
other end of the room by the window, and the savage fury with which the
latter had rushed upon him."
"Pyotr Stepanovitch started, rapidly set the
candle on the table, made ready his revolver, and retreated on tiptoe to
the farthest corner of the room, so that if Kirillov opened the door and
rushed up to the table with the revolver he would still have time to be
the first to aim and fire."
Pyotr Stepanovitch had by now lost all faith in the suicide.
"""He was
standing in the middle of the room, thinking,"" flashed like a whirlwind
through Pyotr Stepanovitch's mind, ""and the room was dark and horrible
too...."
He roared and rushed at me.
"There are two possibilities: either
I interrupted him at the very second when he was pulling the trigger
or... or he was standing planning how to kill me."
"Yes, that's it, he was
planning it...."
"He knows I won't go away without killing him if he funks
it himself--so that he would have to kill me first to prevent my killing
him.... And again, again there is silence."
"I am really frightened: he
may open the door all of a sudden...."
"The nuisance of it is that he
believes in God like any priest...."
"He won't shoot himself for
anything!"
"There are lots of these people nowadays 'who've come to it of
themselves.'"
A rotten lot!
"Oh, damn it, the candle, the candle!"
"It'll go
out within a quarter of an hour for certain...."
"I must put a stop to it;
come what may, I must put a stop to it.... Now I can kill him.... With
that document here no one would think of my killing him."
"I can put him
in such an attitude on the floor with an unloaded revolver in his hand
that they'd be certain he'd done it himself.... Ach, damn it!"
"how is one
to kill him?"
If I open the door he'll rush out again and shoot me first.
"Damn it all, he'll be sure to miss!"""
"He was in agonies, trembling at the necessity of action and his own
indecision."
"At last he took up the candle and again approached the door
with the revolver held up in readiness; he put his left hand, in which
he held the candle, on the doorhandle."
"But he managed awkwardly:
the handle clanked, there was a rattle and a creak."
"""He will fire
straightway,"" flashed through Pyotr Stepanovitch's mind."
"With his foot
he flung the door open violently, raised the candle, and held out the
revolver; but no shot nor cry came from within...."
"There was no one in
the room."
He started.
The room led nowhere.
"There was no exit, no means of
escape from it."
"He lifted the candle higher and looked about him more
attentively: there was certainly no one."
"He called Kirillov's name in a
low voice, then again louder; no one answered."
"""Can he have got out by the window?"""
"The casement in one window was, in
fact, open."
"""Absurd!"
"He couldn't have got away through the casement."""
Pyotr Stepanovitch crossed the room and went up to the window.
"""He
couldn't possibly."""
"All at once he turned round quickly and was aghast
at something extraordinary."
"Against the wall facing the windows on the right of the door stood a
cupboard."
"On the right side of this cupboard, in the corner formed by
the cupboard and the wall, stood Kirillov, and he was standing in a very
strange way; motionless, perfectly erect, with his arms held stiffly at
his sides, his head raised and pressed tightly back against the wall in
the very corner, he seemed to be trying to conceal and efface himself."
"Everything seemed to show that he was hiding, yet somehow it was not
easy to believe it."
"Pyotr Stepanovitch was standing a little sideways
to the corner, and could only see the projecting parts of the figure."
"He could not bring himself to move to the left to get a full view of
Kirillov and solve the mystery."
"His heart began beating violently, and
he felt a sudden rush of blind fury: he started from where he stood,
and, shouting and stamping with his feet, he rushed to the horrible
place."
"But when he reached Kirillov he stopped short again, still more
overcome, horror-stricken."
"What struck him most was that, in spite of
his shout and his furious rush, the figure did not stir, did not move
in a single limb--as though it were of stone or of wax."
"The pallor of
the face was unnatural, the black eyes were quite unmoving and were
staring away at a point in the distance."
"Pyotr Stepanovitch lowered the
candle and raised it again, lighting up the figure from all points of
view and scrutinising it."
"He suddenly noticed that, although Kirillov
was looking straight before him, he could see him and was perhaps
watching him out of the corner of his eye."
"Then the idea occurred to him
to hold the candle right up to the wretch's face, to scorch him and see
what he would do."
"He suddenly fancied that Kirillov's chin twitched and
that something like a mocking smile passed over his lips--as though
he had guessed Pyotr Stepanovitch's thought."
"He shuddered and, beside
himself, clutched violently at Kirillov's shoulder."
"Then something happened so hideous and so soon over that Pyotr
Stepanovitch could never afterwards recover a coherent impression of
it."
"He had hardly touched Kirillov when the latter bent down quickly and
with his head knocked the candle out of Pyotr Stepanovitch's hand; the
candlestick fell with a clang on the ground and the candle went out."
"At
the same moment he was conscious of a fearful pain in the little finger
of his left hand."
"He cried out, and all that he could remember was that,
beside himself, he hit out with all his might and struck three blows
with the revolver on the head of Kirillov, who had bent down to him
and had bitten his finger."
"At last he tore away his finger and rushed
headlong to get out of the house, feeling his way in the dark."
"He was
pursued by terrible shouts from the room."
"""Directly, directly, directly, directly."""
Ten times.
"But he still ran
on, and was running into the porch when he suddenly heard a loud shot."
"Then he stopped short in the dark porch and stood deliberating for five
minutes; at last he made his way back into the house."
"But he had to
get the candle."
"He had only to feel on the floor on the right of the
cupboard for the candlestick; but how was he to light the candle?"
"There
suddenly came into his mind a vague recollection: he recalled that
when he had run into the kitchen the day before to attack Fedka he had
noticed in passing a large red box of matches in a corner on a shelf."
"Feeling with his hands, he made his way to the door on the left leading
to the kitchen, found it, crossed the passage, and went down the steps."
"On the shelf, on the very spot where he had just recalled seeing it, he
felt in the dark a full unopened box of matches."
"He hurriedly went up
the steps again without striking a light, and it was only when he was
near the cupboard, at the spot where he had struck Kirillov with the
revolver and been bitten by him, that he remembered his bitten finger,
and at the same instant was conscious that it was unbearably painful."
"Clenching his teeth, he managed somehow to light the candle-end, set it
in the candlestick again, and looked about him: near the open casement,
with his feet towards the right-hand corner, lay the dead body of
Kirillov."
"The shot had been fired at the right temple and the bullet
had come out at the top on the left, shattering the skull."
"There were
splashes of blood and brains."
"The revolver was still in the suicide's
hand on the floor."
Death must have been instantaneous.
"After a careful
look round, Pyotr Stepanovitch got up and went out on tiptoe, closed the
door, left the candle on the table in the outer room, thought a moment,
and resolved not to put it out, reflecting that it could not possibly
set fire to anything."
"Looking once more at the document left on the
table, he smiled mechanically and then went out of the house, still for
some reason walking on tiptoe."
"He crept through Fedka's hole again and
carefully replaced the posts after him."
"III

Precisely at ten minutes to six Pyotr Stepanovitch and Erkel were
walking up and down the platform at the railway-station beside a rather
long train."
"Pyotr Stepanovitch was setting off and Erkel was saying
good-bye to him."
"The luggage was in, and his bag was in the seat he had
taken in a second-class carriage."
"The first bell had rung already; they
were waiting for the second."
"Pyotr Stepanovitch looked about him, openly
watching the passengers as they got into the train."
"But he did not meet
anyone he knew well; only twice he nodded to acquaintances--a merchant
whom he knew slightly, and then a young village priest who was going
to his parish two stations away."
"Erkel evidently wanted to speak of
something of importance in the last moments, though possibly he did not
himself know exactly of what, but he could not bring himself to begin!"
"He kept fancying that Pyotr Stepanovitch seemed anxious to get rid of
him and was impatient for the last bell."
"""You look at every one so openly,"" he observed with some timidity, as
though he would have warned him."
"""Why not?"
It would not do for me to conceal myself at present.
"It's too
soon."
Don't be uneasy.
"All I am afraid of is that the devil might send
Liputin this way; he might scent me out and race off here."""
"""Pyotr Stepanovitch, they are not to be trusted,"" Erkel brought out
resolutely."
"""Liputin?"""
"""None of them, Pyotr Stepanovitch."""
"""Nonsense!"
they are all bound by what happened yesterday.
"There isn't
one who would turn traitor."
"People won't go to certain destruction
unless they've lost their reason."""
"""Pyotr Stepanovitch, but they will lose their reason."""
"Evidently that
idea had already occurred to Pyotr Stepanovitch too, and so Erkel's
observation irritated him the more."
"""You are not in a funk too, are you, Erkel?"
"I rely on you more than on
any of them."
I've seen now what each of them is worth.
"Tell them to-day
all I've told you."
I leave them in your charge.
"Go round to each of them
this morning."
"Read them my written instructions to-morrow, or the day
after, when you are all together and they are capable of listening
again... and believe me, they will be by to-morrow, for they'll be in an
awful funk, and that will make them as soft as wax...."
"The great thing
is that you shouldn't be downhearted."""
"""Ach, Pyotr Stepanovitch, it would be better if you weren't going away."""
"""But I am only going for a few days; I shall be back in no time."""
"""Pyotr Stepanovitch,"" Erkel brought out warily but resolutely, ""what if
you were going to Petersburg?"
"Of course, I understand that you are only
doing what's necessary for the cause."""
"""I expected as much from you, Erkel."
"If you have guessed that I am going
to Petersburg you can realise that I couldn't tell them yesterday, at
that moment, that I was going so far for fear of frightening them."
"You
saw for yourself what a state they were in."
"But you understand that I
am going for the cause, for work of the first importance, for the common
cause, and not to save my skin, as Liputin imagines."""
"""Pyotr Stepanovitch, what if you were going abroad?"
"I should
understand..."
"I should understand that you must be careful of yourself
because you are everything and we are nothing."
"I shall understand, Pyotr
Stepanovitch."""
The poor boy's voice actually quivered.
"""Thank you, Erkel.... Aie, you've touched my bad finger."""
"(Erkel had
pressed his hand awkwardly; the bad finger was discreetly bound up
in black silk.)"
"""But I tell you positively again that I am going to
Petersburg only to sniff round, and perhaps shall only be there for
twenty-four hours and then back here again at once."
"When I come back I
shall stay at Gaganov's country place for the sake of appearances."
"If
there is any notion of danger, I should be the first to take the lead
and share it."
"If I stay longer in Petersburg I'll let you know at once
... in the way we've arranged, and you'll tell them."""
"The second bell
rang."
"""Ah, then there's only five minutes before the train starts."
"I don't
want the group here to break up, you know."
"I am not afraid; don't be
anxious about me."
"I have plenty of such centres, and it's not much
consequence; but there's no harm in having as many centres as possible."
"But I am quite at ease about you, though I am leaving you almost alone
with those idiots."
"Don't be uneasy; they won't turn traitor, they won't
have the pluck.... Ha ha, you going to-day too?"""
"he cried suddenly in a
quite different, cheerful voice to a very young man, who came up gaily
to greet him."
"""I didn't know you were going by the express too."
"Where
are you off to... your mother's?"""
"The mother of the young man was a very wealthy landowner in a
neighbouring province, and the young man was a distant relation of Yulia
Mihailovna's and had been staying about a fortnight in our town."
"""No, I am going farther, to R----."
"I've eight hours to live through in
the train."
"Off to Petersburg?"""
laughed the young man.
"""What makes you suppose I must be going to Petersburg?"""
"said Pyotr
Stepanovitch, laughing even more openly."
The young man shook his gloved finger at him.
"""Well, you've guessed right,"" Pyotr Stepanovitch whispered to him
mysteriously."
"""I am going with letters from Yulia Mihailovna and have to
call on three or four personages, as you can imagine--bother them all,
to speak candidly."
"It's a beastly job!"""
"""But why is she in such a panic?"
"Tell me,"" the young man whispered too."
"""She wouldn't see even me yesterday."
"I don't think she has anything to
fear for her husband, quite the contrary; he fell down so creditably at
the fire--ready to sacrifice his life, so to speak."""
"""Well, there it is,"" laughed Pyotr Stepanovitch."
"""You see, she is
afraid that people may have written from here already... that is, some
gentlemen...."
"The fact is, Stavrogin is at the bottom of it, or rather
Prince K.... Ech, it's a long story; I'll tell you something about it on
the journey if you like--as far as my chivalrous feelings will allow
me, at least...."
"This is my relation, Lieutenant Erkel, who lives down
here."""
"The young man, who had been stealthily glancing at Erkel, touched his
hat; Erkel made a bow."
"""But I say, Verhovensky, eight hours in the train is an awful ordeal."
"Berestov, the colonel, an awfully funny fellow, is travelling with me in
the first class."
"He is a neighbour of ours in the country, and his wife
is a Garin (_née_ de Garine), and you know he is a very decent fellow."
He's got ideas too.
He's only been here a couple of days.
"He's
passionately fond of whist; couldn't we get up a game, eh?"
"I've already
fixed on a fourth--Pripuhlov, our merchant from T----with a beard, a
millionaire--I mean it, a real millionaire; you can take my word for
it...."
I'll introduce you; he is a very interesting money-bag.
"We shall
have a laugh."""
"""I shall be delighted, and I am awfully fond of cards in the train, but
I am going second class."""
"""Nonsense, that's no matter."
Get in with us.
"I'll tell them directly to
move you to the first class."
"The chief guard would do anything I tell
him."
What have you got?...
a bag?
"a rug?"""
"""First-rate."
"Come along!"""
"Pyotr Stepanovitch took his bag, his rug, and his book, and at once and
with alacrity transferred himself to the first class."
Erkel helped him.
The third bell rang.
"""Well, Erkel."""
"Hurriedly, and with a preoccupied air, Pyotr Stepanovitch
held out his hand from the window for the last time."
"""You see, I am
sitting down to cards with them."""
"""Why explain, Pyotr Stepanovitch?"
"I understand, I understand it all!"""
"""Well, au revoir,"" Pyotr Stepanovitch turned away suddenly on his
name being called by the young man, who wanted to introduce him to his
partners."
And Erkel saw nothing more of Pyotr Stepanovitch.
He returned home very sad.
"Not that he was alarmed at Pyotr
Stepanovitch's leaving them so suddenly, but... he had turned away from
him so quickly when that young swell had called to him and... he might
have said something different to him, not ""Au revoir,"" or... or at
least have pressed his hand more warmly."
That last was bitterest of all.
"Something else was beginning to gnaw in his poor little heart, something
which he could not understand himself yet, something connected with the
evening before."
CHAPTER VII.
"STEPAN TROFIMOVITCH'S LAST WANDERING


I

I am persuaded that Stepan Trofimovitch was terribly frightened as
he felt the time fixed for his insane enterprise drawing near."
"I am
convinced that he suffered dreadfully from terror, especially on the
night before he started--that awful night."
"Nastasya mentioned afterwards
that he had gone to bed late and fallen asleep."
"But that proves nothing;
men sentenced to death sleep very soundly, they say, even the night
before their execution."
"Though he set off by daylight, when a nervous
man is always a little more confident (and the major, Virginsky's
relative, used to give up believing in God every morning when the night
was over), yet I am convinced he could never, without horror, have
imagined himself alone on the high road in such a position."
"No doubt
a certain desperation in his feelings softened at first the terrible
sensation of sudden solitude in which he at once found himself as soon
as he had left Nastasya, and the corner in which he had been warm and
snug for twenty years."
"But it made no difference; even with the clearest
recognition of all the horrors awaiting him he would have gone out to
the high road and walked along it!"
"There was something proud in the
undertaking which allured him in spite of everything."
"Oh, he might have
accepted Varvara Petrovna's luxurious provision and have remained living
on her charity, ""_comme un_ humble dependent."""
"But he had not accepted her
charity and was not remaining!"
"And here he was leaving her of himself,
and holding aloft the ""standard of a great idea, and going to die for it
on the open road."""
"That is how he must have been feeling; that's how his
action must have appeared to him."
Another question presented itself to me more than once.
"Why did he run
away, that is, literally run away on foot, rather than simply drive
away?"
"I put it down at first to the impracticability of fifty years and
the fantastic bent of his mind under the influence of strong emotion."
"I imagined that the thought of posting tickets and horses (even if
they had bells) would have seemed too simple and prosaic to him; a
pilgrimage, on the other hand, even under an umbrella, was ever so much
more picturesque and in character with love and resentment."
"But now that
everything is over, I am inclined to think that it all came about in a
much simpler way."
"To begin with, he was afraid to hire horses because
Varvara Petrovna might have heard of it and prevented him from going by
force; which she certainly would have done, and he certainly would have
given in, and then farewell to the great idea forever."
"Besides, to take
tickets for anywhere he must have known at least where he was going."
"But
to think about that was the greatest agony to him at that moment; he
was utterly unable to fix upon a place."
"For if he had to fix on any
particular town his enterprise would at once have seemed in his own eyes
absurd and impossible; he felt that very strongly."
"What should he do in
that particular town rather than in any other?"
Look out for _ce marchand_?
But what _marchand_?
"At that point his second and most terrible question
cropped up."
"In reality there was nothing he dreaded more than _ce
marchand_, whom he had rushed off to seek so recklessly, though, of
course, he was terribly afraid of finding him."
"No, better simply the
high road, better simply to set off for it, and walk along it and to
think of nothing so long as he could put off thinking."
"The high road is
something very very long, of which one cannot see the end--like human
life, like human dreams."
"There is an idea in the open road, but what
sort of idea is there in travelling with posting tickets?"
"Posting
tickets mean an end to ideas."
"_Vive la grande route_ and then as God
wills."
"After the sudden and unexpected interview with Liza which I have
described, he rushed on, more lost in forgetfulness than ever."
"The high
road passed half a mile from Skvoreshniki and, strange to say, he was
not at first aware that he was on it."
"Logical reasoning or even distinct
consciousness was unbearable to him at this moment."
"A fine rain kept
drizzling, ceasing, and drizzling again; but he did not even notice
the rain."
"He did not even notice either how he threw his bag over his
shoulder, nor how much more comfortably he walked with it so."
"He must
have walked like that for nearly a mile or so when he suddenly stood
still and looked round."
"The old road, black, marked with wheel-ruts
and planted with willows on each side, ran before him like an endless
thread; on the right hand were bare plains from which the harvest had
long ago been carried; on the left there were bushes and in the distance
beyond them a copse."
"And far, far away a scarcely perceptible line of the railway, running
aslant, and on it the smoke of a train, but no sound was heard."
"Stepan
Trofimovitch felt a little timid, but only for a moment."
"He heaved a
vague sigh, put down his bag beside a willow, and sat down to rest."
"As he moved to sit down he was conscious of being chilly and wrapped
himself in his rug; noticing at the same time that it was raining, he
put up his umbrella."
"He sat like that for some time, moving his lips
from time to time and firmly grasping the umbrella handle."
"Images of all
sorts passed in feverish procession before him, rapidly succeeding one
another in his mind."
"""Lise, Lise,"" he thought, ""and with her _ce Maurice_...."
"Strange
people...."
"But what was the strange fire, and what were they talking
about, and who were murdered?"
"I fancy Nastasya has not found out yet and
is still waiting for me with my coffee... cards?"
"Did I really lose men
at cards?"
H'm!
"Among us in Russia in the times of serfdom, so called....
My God, yes--Fedka!"""
He started all over with terror and looked about him.
"""What if that
Fedka is in hiding somewhere behind the bushes?"
"They say he has a
regular band of robbers here on the high road."
"Oh, mercy, I..."
"I'll
tell him the whole truth then, that I was to blame... and that I've
been miserable about him _for ten years_."
"More miserable than he was as
a soldier, and..."
I'll give him my purse.
H'm!
"_J'ai en tout quarante
roubles; il prendra les roubles et il me tuera tout de même._""

In his panic he for some reason shut up the umbrella and laid it down
beside him."
"A cart came into sight on the high road in the distance
coming from the town."
"""_Grace à Dieu_, that's a cart and it's coming at a walking pace; that
can't be dangerous."
The wretched little horses here...
"I always said
that breed..."
"It was Pyotr Ilyitch though, he talked at the club
about horse-breeding and I trumped him, _et puis_... but what's that
behind?..."
I believe there's a woman in the cart.
"A peasant and a woman,
_cela commence à être rassurant._ The woman behind and the man in front--
_c'est très rassurant._ There's a cow behind the cart tied by the horns,
_c'est rassurant au plus haut degré._""

The cart reached him; it was a fairly solid peasant cart."
"The woman was
sitting on a tightly stuffed sack and the man on the front of the cart
with his legs hanging over towards Stepan Trofimovitch."
"A red cow was,
in fact, shambling behind, tied by the horns to the cart."
"The man
and the woman gazed open-eyed at Stepan Trofimovitch, and Stepan
Trofimovitch gazed back at them with equal wonder, but after he had let
them pass twenty paces, he got up hurriedly all of a sudden and walked
after them."
"In the proximity of the cart it was natural that he
should feel safer, but when he had overtaken it he became oblivious
of everything again and sank back into his disconnected thoughts and
fancies."
"He stepped along with no suspicion, of course, that for the
two peasants he was at that instant the most mysterious and interesting
object that one could meet on the high road."
"""What sort may you be, pray, if it's not uncivil to ask?"""
"the woman
could not resist asking at last when Stepan Trofimovitch glanced
absent-mindedly at her."
"She was a woman of about seven and twenty,
sturdily built, with black eyebrows, rosy cheeks, and a friendly smile
on her red lips, between which gleamed white even teeth."
"""You... you are addressing me?"""
"muttered Stepan Trofimovitch with
mournful wonder."
"""A merchant, for sure,"" the peasant observed confidently."
"He was a
well-grown man of forty with a broad and intelligent face, framed in a
reddish beard."
"""No, I am not exactly a merchant, I..."
"I... _moi c'est autre chose._""
Stepan Trofimovitch parried the question somehow, and to be on the safe
side he dropped back a little from the cart, so that he was walking on a
level with the cow."
"""Must be a gentleman,"" the man decided, hearing words not Russian, and
he gave a tug at the horse."
"""That's what set us wondering."
"You are out for a walk seemingly?"""
"the
woman asked inquisitively again."
"""You... you ask me?"""
"""Foreigners come from other parts sometimes by the train; your boots
don't seem to be from hereabouts....""

""They are army boots,"" the man put in complacently and significantly."
"""No, I am not precisely in the army, I...""

""What an inquisitive woman!"""
Stepan Trofimovitch mused with vexation.
"""And how they stare at me... _mais enfin_."
"In fact, it's strange that I
feel, as it were, conscience-stricken before them, and yet I've done
them no harm."""
The woman was whispering to the man.
"""If it's no offence, we'd give you a lift if so be it's agreeable."""
Stepan Trofimovitch suddenly roused himself.
"""Yes, yes, my friends, I accept it with pleasure, for I'm very tired;
but how am I to get in?"""
"""How wonderful it is,"" he thought to himself, ""that I've been walking
so long beside that cow and it never entered my head to ask them for a
lift."
"This 'real life' has something very original about it."""
"But the peasant had not, however, pulled up the horse."
"""But where are you bound for?"""
he asked with some mistrustfulness.
Stepan Trofimovitch did not understand him at once.
"""To Hatovo, I suppose?"""
"""Hatov?"
"No, not to Hatov's exactly... And I don't know him though I've
heard of him."""
"""The village of Hatovo, the village, seven miles from here."""
"""A village?"
"_C'est charmant,_ to be sure I've heard of it....""

Stepan Trofimovitch was still walking, they had not yet taken him into
the cart."
A guess that was a stroke of genius flashed through his mind.
"""You think perhaps that I am..."
"I've got a passport and I am a
professor, that is, if you like, a teacher... but a head teacher."
"I am a
head teacher."
"_Oui, c'est comme ça qu'on peut traduire._ I should be very
glad of a lift and I'll buy you..."
"I'll buy you a quart of vodka for
it."""
"""It'll be half a rouble, sir; it's a bad road."""
"""Or it wouldn't be fair to ourselves,"" put in the woman."
"""Half a rouble?"
"Very good then, half a rouble."
"_C'est encore mieux; j'ai
en tout quarante roubles mais_...""

The peasant stopped the horse and by their united efforts Stepan
Trofimovitch was dragged into the cart, and seated on the sack by the
woman."
He was still pursued by the same whirl of ideas.
"Sometimes he was
aware himself that he was terribly absent-minded, and that he was not
thinking of what he ought to be thinking of and wondered at it."
"This
consciousness of abnormal weakness of mind became at moments very
painful and even humiliating to him."
"""How... how is this you've got a cow behind?"""
"he suddenly asked the
woman."
"""What do you mean, sir, as though you'd never seen one,"" laughed the
woman."
"""We bought it in the town,"" the peasant put in."
"""Our cattle died last
spring... the plague."
"All the beasts have died round us, all of them."
"There aren't half of them left, it's heartbreaking."""
"And again he lashed the horse, which had got stuck in a rut."
"""Yes, that does happen among you in Russia... in general we Russians...
Well, yes, it happens,"" Stepan Trofimovitch broke off."
"""If you are a teacher, what are you going to Hatovo for?"
"Maybe you are
going on farther."""
"""I..."
"I'm not going farther precisely.... _C'est-à-dire,_ I'm going to a
merchant's."""
"""To Spasov, I suppose?"""
"""Yes, yes, to Spasov."
"But that's no matter."""
"""If you are going to Spasov and on foot, it will take you a week in your
boots,"" laughed the woman."
"""I dare say, I dare say, no matter, _mes amis_, no matter."""
"Stepan
Trofimovitch cut her short impatiently."
"""Awfully inquisitive people; but the woman speaks better than he does,
and I notice that since February 19,* their language has altered a
little, and... and what business is it of mine whether I'm going to
Spasov or not?"
"Besides, I'll pay them, so why do they pester me."""
"*February 19, 1861, the day of the Emancipation of the Serfs, is
      meant.--Translator's note."
"""If you are going to Spasov, you must take the steamer,"" the peasant
persisted."
"""That's true indeed,"" the woman put in with animation, ""for if you
drive along the bank it's twenty-five miles out of the way."""
"""Thirty-five."""
"""You'll just catch the steamer at Ustyevo at two o'clock tomorrow,"" the
woman decided finally."
But Stepan Trofimovitch was obstinately silent.
"His questioners, too, sank into silence."
"The peasant tugged at his horse
at rare intervals; the peasant woman exchanged brief remarks with him."
Stepan Trofimovitch fell into a doze.
"He was tremendously surprised when
the woman, laughing, gave him a poke and he found himself in a rather
large village at the door of a cottage with three windows."
"""You've had a nap, sir?"""
"""What is it?"
Where am I?
"Ah, yes!"
"Well... never mind,"" sighed Stepan
Trofimovitch, and he got out of the cart."
"He looked about him mournfully; the village scene seemed strange to him
and somehow terribly remote."
"""And the half-rouble, I was forgetting it!"""
"he said to the peasant,
turning to him with an excessively hurried gesture; he was evidently by
now afraid to part from them."
"""We'll settle indoors, walk in,"" the peasant invited him."
"""It's comfortable inside,"" the woman said reassuringly."
Stepan Trofimovitch mounted the shaky steps.
"""How can it be?"""
"he
murmured in profound and apprehensive perplexity."
"He went into the
cottage, however."
"_""Elle l'a voulu""_ he felt a stab at his heart and again
he became oblivious of everything, even of the fact that he had gone
into the cottage."
"It was a light and fairly clean peasant's cottage, with three windows
and two rooms; not exactly an inn, but a cottage at which people
who knew the place were accustomed to stop on their way through the
village."
"Stepan Trofimovitch, quite unembarrassed, went to the foremost
corner; forgot to greet anyone, sat down and sank into thought."
"Meanwhile a sensation of warmth, extremely agreeable after three hours
of travelling in the damp, was suddenly diffused throughout his person."
"Even the slight shivers that spasmodically ran down his spine--such as
always occur in particularly nervous people when they are feverish and
have suddenly come into a warm room from the cold--became all at once
strangely agreeable."
"He raised his head and the delicious fragrance of
the hot pancakes with which the woman of the house was busy at the stove
tickled his nostrils."
"With a childlike smile he leaned towards the woman
and suddenly said:

""What's that?"
Are they pancakes?
"_Mais... c'est charmant._""

""Would you like some, sir?"""
the woman politely offered him at once.
"""I should like some, I certainly should, and... may I ask you for some
tea too,"" said Stepan Trofimovitch, reviving."
"""Get the samovar?"
"With the greatest pleasure."""
"On a large plate with a big blue pattern on it were served the
pancakes--regular peasant pancakes, thin, made half of wheat, covered
with fresh hot butter, most delicious pancakes."
"Stepan Trofimovitch
tasted them with relish."
"""How rich they are and how good!"
"And if one could only have _un doigt
d'eau de vie_."""
"""It's a drop of vodka you would like, sir, isn't it?"""
"""Just so, just so, a little, _un tout petit rien_."""
"""Five farthings' worth, I suppose?"""
"""Five, yes, five, five, five, _un tout petit rien_,"" Stepan Trofimovitch
assented with a blissful smile."
"Ask a peasant to do anything for you, and if he can, and will, he
will serve you with care and friendliness; but ask him to fetch you
vodka--and his habitual serenity and friendliness will pass at once into
a sort of joyful haste and alacrity; he will be as keen in your
interest as though you were one of his family."
"The peasant who fetches
vodka--even though you are going to drink it and not he and he knows
that beforehand--seems, as it were, to be enjoying part of your future
gratification."
"Within three minutes (the tavern was only two paces
away), a bottle and a large greenish wineglass were set on the table
before Stepan Trofimovitch."
"""Is that all for me!"""
He was extremely surprised.
"""I've always had vodka
but I never knew you could get so much for five farthings."""
"He filled the wineglass, got up and with a certain solemnity crossed the
room to the other corner where his fellow-traveller, the black-browed
peasant woman, who had shared the sack with him and bothered him with
her questions, had ensconced herself."
"The woman was taken aback, and
began to decline, but after having said all that was prescribed by
politeness, she stood up and drank it decorously in three sips, as women
do, and, with an expression of intense suffering on her face, gave back
the wineglass and bowed to Stepan Trofimovitch."
"He returned the bow with
dignity and returned to the table with an expression of positive pride
on his countenance."
"All this was done on the inspiration of the moment: a second before he
had no idea that he would go and treat the peasant woman."
"""I know how to get on with peasants to perfection, to perfection, and
I've always told them so,"" he thought complacently, pouring out the rest
of the vodka; though there was less than a glass left, it warmed and
revived him, and even went a little to his head."
"_""Je suis malade tout à fait, mais ce n'est pas trop mauvais d'être
malade."
"""_

""Would you care to purchase?"""
"a gentle feminine voice asked close by
him."
"He raised his eyes and to his surprise saw a lady--_une dame et elle en
avait l'air,_ somewhat over thirty, very modest in appearance, dressed not
like a peasant, in a dark gown with a grey shawl on her shoulders."
"There was something very kindly in her face which attracted Stepan
Trofimovitch immediately."
"She had only just come back to the cottage,
where her things had been left on a bench close by the place where
Stepan Trofimovitch had seated himself."
"Among them was a portfolio,
at which he remembered he had looked with curiosity on going in, and a
pack, not very large, of American leather."
"From this pack she took out
two nicely bound books with a cross engraved on the cover, and offered
them to Stepan Trofimovitch."
"""_Et... mais je crois que c'est l'Evangile..._ with the greatest
pleasure.... Ah, now I understand.... _Vous êtes ce qu'on appelle_ a
gospel-woman; I've read more than once.... Half a rouble?"""
"""Thirty-five kopecks,"" answered the gospel-woman."
"""With the greatest
pleasure."
"_Je n'ai rien contre l'Evangile,_ and I've been wanting to
re-read it for a long time....""

The idea occurred to him at the moment that he had not read the gospel
for thirty years at least, and at most had recalled some passages of it,
seven years before, when reading Renan's ""Vie de Jésus."""
"As he had no
small change he pulled out his four ten-rouble notes--all that he
had."
"The woman of the house undertook to get change, and only then
he noticed, looking round, that a good many people had come into the
cottage, and that they had all been watching him for some time past, and
seemed to be talking about him."
"They were talking too of the fire in the
town, especially the owner of the cart who had only just returned from
the town with the cow."
"They talked of arson, of the Shpigulin men."
"""He said nothing to me about the fire when he brought me along, although
he talked of everything,"" struck Stepan Trofimovitch for some reason."
"""Master, Stepan Trofimovitch, sir, is it you I see?"
"Well, I never should
have thought it!..."
"Don't you know me?"""
"exclaimed a middle-aged man who
looked like an old-fashioned house-serf, wearing no beard and dressed
in an overcoat with a wide turn-down collar."
"Stepan Trofimovitch was
alarmed at hearing his own name."
"""Excuse me,"" he muttered, ""I don't quite remember you."""
"""You don't remember me."
"I am Anisim, Anisim Ivanov."
"I used to be in the
service of the late Mr. Gaganov, and many's the time I've seen you, sir,
with Varvara Petrovna at the late Avdotya Sergyevna's."
"I used to go to
you with books from her, and twice I brought you Petersburg sweets from
her....""

""Why, yes, I remember you, Anisim,"" said Stepan Trofimovitch, smiling."
"""Do you live here?"""
"""I live near Spasov, close to the V---- Monastery, in the service
of Marta Sergyevna, Avdotya Sergyevna's sister."
"Perhaps your honour
remembers her; she broke her leg falling out of her carriage on her
way to a ball."
"Now her honour lives near the monastery, and I am in her
service."
"And now as your honour sees, I am on my way to the town to see
my kinsfolk."""
"""Quite so, quite so."""
"""I felt so pleased when I saw you, you used to be so kind to me,""
Anisim smiled delightedly."
"""But where are you travelling to, sir, all by
yourself as it seems.... You've never been a journey alone, I fancy?"""
Stepan Trofimovitch looked at him in alarm.
"""You are going, maybe, to our parts, to Spasov?"""
"""Yes, I am going to Spasov."
"_Il me semble que tout le monde va à
Spassof._""

""You don't say it's to Fyodor Matveyevitch's?"
"They will be pleased to
see you."
"He had such a respect for you in old days; he often speaks of
you now."""
"""Yes, yes, to Fyodor Matveyevitch's."""
"""To be sure, to be sure."
"The peasants here are wondering; they make out
they met you, sir, walking on the high road."
"They are a foolish lot."""
"""I..."
I...
"Yes, you know, Anisim, I made a wager, you know, like an
Englishman, that I would go on foot and I...""

The perspiration came out on his forehead."
"""To be sure, to be sure."""
Anisim listened with merciless curiosity.
"But
Stepan Trofimovitch could bear it no longer."
"He was so disconcerted that
he was on the point of getting up and going out of the cottage."
"But the
samovar was brought in, and at the same moment the gospel-woman, who
had been out of the room, returned."
"With the air of a man clutching at a
straw he turned to her and offered her tea."
"Anisim submitted and walked
away."
"The peasants certainly had begun to feel perplexed: ""What sort of person
is he?"
"He was found walking on the high road, he says he is a teacher,
he is dressed like a foreigner, and has no more sense than a little
child; he answers queerly as though he had run away from someone, and
he's got money!"""
"An idea was beginning to gain ground that information
must be given to the authorities, ""especially as things weren't quite
right in the town."""
But Anisim set all that right in a minute.
"Going
into the passage he explained to every one who cared to listen that
Stepan Trofimovitch was not exactly a teacher but ""a very learned man
and busy with very learned studies, and was a landowner of the district
himself, and had been living for twenty-two years with her excellency,
the general's widow, the stout Madame Stavrogin, and was by way of being
the most important person in her house, and was held in the greatest
respect by every one in the town."
"He used to lose by fifties and
hundreds in an evening at the club of the nobility, and in rank he was
a councillor, which was equal to a lieutenant-colonel in the army, which
was next door to being a colonel."
"As for his having money, he had
so much from the stout Madame Stavrogin that there was no reckoning
it""--and so on and so on."
"_""Mais c'est une dame et très comme il faut,""_ thought Stepan
Trofimovitch, as he recovered from Anisim's attack, gazing with
agreeable curiosity at his neighbour, the gospel pedlar, who was,
however, drinking the tea from a saucer and nibbling at a piece of
sugar."
"""_Ce petit morceau de sucre, ce n'est rien...._ There is something
noble and independent about her, and at the same time--gentle."
"_Le comme
il faut tout pur,_ but rather in a different style."""
"He soon learned from her that her name was Sofya Matveyevna Ulitin and
she lived at K----, that she had a sister there, a widow; that she was a
widow too, and that her husband, who was a sub-lieutenant risen from the
ranks, had been killed at Sevastopol."
"""But you are still so young, _vous n'avez pas trente ans_."""
"""Thirty-four,"" said Sofya Matveyevna, smiling."
"""What, you understand French?"""
"""A little."
"I lived for four years after that in a gentleman's family,
and there I picked it up from the children."""
"She told him that being left a widow at eighteen she was for some time
in Sevastopol as a nurse, and had afterwards lived in various places,
and now she travelled about selling the gospel."
"""_Mais, mon Dieu,_ wasn't it you who had a strange adventure in our town,
a very strange adventure?"""
She flushed; it turned out that it had been she.
"_""Ces vauriens, ces malheureux,""_ he began in a voice quivering with
indignation; miserable and hateful recollections stirred painfully in
his heart."
For a minute he seemed to sink into oblivion.
"""Bah, but she's gone away again,"" he thought, with a start, noticing
that she was not by his side."
"""She keeps going out and is busy about
something; I notice that she seems upset too.... _Bah, je deviens
egoiste!_""

He raised his eyes and saw Anisim again, but this time in the most
menacing surroundings."
"The whole cottage was full of peasants, and it
was evidently Anisim who had brought them all in."
"Among them were the
master of the house, and the peasant with the cow, two other peasants
(they turned out to be cab-drivers), another little man, half drunk,
dressed like a peasant but clean-shaven, who seemed like a townsman
ruined by drink and talked more than any of them."
"And they were all
discussing him, Stepan Trofimovitch."
"The peasant with the cow insisted
on his point that to go round by the lake would be thirty-five miles out
of the way, and that he certainly must go by steamer."
"The half-drunken
man and the man of the house warmly retorted:

""Seeing that, though of course it will be nearer for his honour on
the steamer over the lake; that's true enough, but maybe according to
present arrangements the steamer doesn't go there, brother."""
"""It does go, it does, it will go for another week,"" cried Anisim, more
excited than any of them."
"""That's true enough, but it doesn't arrive punctually, seeing it's late
in the season, and sometimes it'll stay three days together at Ustyevo."""
"""It'll be there to-morrow at two o'clock punctually."
"You'll be at Spasov
punctually by the evening,"" cried Anisim, eager to do his best for
Stepan Trofimovitch."
"_""Mais qu'est-ce qu'il a cet homme,""_ thought Stepan Trofimovitch,
trembling and waiting in terror for what was in store for him."
"The cab-drivers, too, came forward and began bargaining with him; they
asked three roubles to Ustyevo."
"The others shouted that that was not too
much, that that was the fare, and that they had been driving from here
to Ustyevo all the summer for that fare."
"""But... it's nice here too.... And I don't want..."" Stepan Trofimovitch
mumbled in protest."
"""Nice it is, sir, you are right there, it's wonderfully nice at Spasov
now and Fyodor Matveyevitch will be so pleased to see you."""
"""_Mon Dieu, mes amis,_ all this is such a surprise to me."""
At last Sofya Matveyevna came back.
"But she sat down on the bench
looking dejected and mournful."
"""I can't get to Spasov!"""
she said to the woman of the cottage.
"""Why, you are bound to Spasov, too, then?"""
"cried Stepan Trofimovitch,
starting."
"It appeared that a lady had the day before told her to wait at Hatovo
and had promised to take her to Spasov, and now this lady had not turned
up after all."
"""What am I to do now?"""
repeated Sofya Matveyevna.
"""_Mais, ma chère et nouvelle amie,_ I can take you just as well as the
lady to that village, whatever it is, to which I've hired horses, and
to-morrow--well, to-morrow, we'll go on together to Spasov."""
"""Why, are you going to Spasov too?"""
"""_Mais que faire, et je suis enchanté!_ I shall take you with the greatest
pleasure; you see they want to take me, I've engaged them already."
"Which of you did I engage?"""
"Stepan Trofimovitch suddenly felt an intense
desire to go to Spasov."
"Within a quarter of an hour they were getting into a covered trap, he
very lively and quite satisfied, she with her pack beside him, with a
grateful smile on her face."
Anisim helped them in.
"""A good journey to you, sir,"" said he, bustling officiously round the
trap, ""it has been a treat to see you."""
"""Good-bye, good-bye, my friend, good-bye."""
"""You'll see Fyodor Matveyevitch, sir...""

""Yes, my friend, yes... Fyodor Petrovitch... only good-bye."""
"II

""You see, my friend... you'll allow me to call myself your friend,
n'est-ce pas?"""
"Stepan Trofimovitch began hurriedly as soon as the trap
started."
"""You see I... _J'aime le peuple, c'est indispensable, mais il me
semble que je ne m'avais jamais vu de près."
"Stasie... cela va sans dire
qu'elle est aussi du peuple, mais le vrai peuple,_ that is, the real
ones, who are on the high road, it seems to me they care for nothing,
but where exactly I am going..."
But let bygones be bygones.
"I fancy I am
talking at random, but I believe it's from being flustered."""
"""You don't seem quite well."""
"Sofya Matveyevna watched him keenly though
respectfully."
"""No, no, I must only wrap myself up, besides there's a fresh wind, very
fresh in fact, but... let us forget that."
"That's not what I really meant
to say."
"_Chère et incomparable amie,_ I feel that I am almost happy, and
it's your doing."
"Happiness is not good for me for it makes me rush to
forgive all my enemies at once....""

""Why, that's a very good thing, sir."""
"""Not always, _chère innocente."
"L'Evangile... voyez-vous, désormais nous
prêcherons ensemble_ and I will gladly sell your beautiful little books."
"Yes, I feel that that perhaps is an idea, _quelque chose de très nouveau
dans ce genre._ The peasants are religious, _c'est admis,_ but they don't
yet know the gospel."
"I will expound it to them.... By verbal explanation
one might correct the mistakes in that remarkable book, which I am of
course prepared to treat with the utmost respect."
"I will be of service
even on the high road."
"I've always been of use, I always told _them_ so _et
à cette chère ingrate...._ Oh, we will forgive, we will forgive, first
of all we will forgive all and always.... We will hope that we too shall
be forgiven."
"Yes, for all, every one of us, have wronged one another,
all are guilty!"""
"""That's a very good saying, I think, sir."""
"""Yes, yes...."
I feel that I am speaking well.
"I shall speak to them very
well, but what was the chief thing I meant to say?"
"I keep losing the
thread and forgetting.... Will you allow me to remain with you?"
"I
feel that the look in your eyes and..."
"I am surprised in fact at your
manners."
"You are simple-hearted, you call me 'sir,' and turn your cup
upside down on your saucer... and that horrid lump of sugar; but there's
something charming about you, and I see from your features.... Oh,
don't blush and don't be afraid of me as a man."
"_Chère et incomparable,
pour moi une femme c'est tout._ I can't live without a woman, but only
at her side, only at her side..."
"I am awfully muddled, awfully."
"I can't
remember what I meant to say."
"Oh, blessed is he to whom God always sends
a woman and... and I fancy, indeed, that I am in a sort of ecstasy."
There's a lofty idea in the open road too!
"That's what I meant to say,
that's it--about the idea."
"Now I've remembered it, but I kept losing it
before."
And why have they taken us farther.
"It was nice there too, but
here--_cela devien trop froid."
"A propos, j'ai en tout quarante roubles
et voilà cet argent,_ take it, take it, I can't take care of it, I shall
lose it or it will be taken away from me...."
"I seem to be sleepy, I've
a giddiness in my head."
"Yes, I am giddy, I am giddy, I am giddy."
"Oh, how
kind you are, what's that you are wrapping me up in?"""
"""You are certainly in a regular fever and I've covered you with my rug;
only about the money, I'd rather."""
"""Oh, for God's sake, _n'en parlons plus parce que cela me fait mal._ Oh,
how kind you are!"""
"He ceased speaking, and with strange suddenness dropped into a feverish
shivery sleep."
"The road by which they drove the twelve miles was not a
smooth one, and their carriage jolted cruelly."
"Stepan Trofimovitch woke
up frequently, quickly raised his head from the little pillow which
Sofya Matveyevna had slipped under it, clutched her by the hand and
asked ""Are you here?"""
as though he were afraid she had left him.
"He told
her, too, that he had dreamed of gaping jaws full of teeth, and that he
had very much disliked it."
"Sofya Matveyevna was in great anxiety about
him."
"They were driven straight up to a large cottage with a frontage of
four windows and other rooms in the yard."
"Stepan Trofimovitch waked up,
hurriedly went in and walked straight into the second room, which was
the largest and best in the house."
"An expression of fussiness came into
his sleepy face."
"He spoke at once to the landlady, a tall, thick-set
woman of forty with very dark hair and a slight moustache, and explained
that he required the whole room for himself, and that the door was to be
shut and no one else was to be admitted, ""_parce que nous avons à parler."
"Oui, j'ai beaucoup à vous dire, chère amie._ I'll pay you, I'll pay you,""
he said with a wave of dismissal to the landlady."
"Though he was in a hurry, he seemed to articulate with difficulty."
"The
landlady listened grimly, and was silent in token of consent, but there
was a feeling of something menacing about her silence."
"He did not notice
this, and hurriedly (he was in a terrible hurry) insisted on her going
away and bringing them their dinner as quickly as possible, without a
moment's delay."
At that point the moustached woman could contain herself no longer.
"""This is not an inn, sir; we don't provide dinners for travellers."
"We
can boil you some crayfish or set the samovar, but we've nothing more."
"There won't be fresh fish till to-morrow."""
"But Stepan Trofimovitch waved his hands, repeating with wrathful
impatience: ""I'll pay, only make haste, make haste."""
"They settled on fish, soup, and roast fowl; the landlady declared that
fowl was not to be procured in the whole village; she agreed, however,
to go in search of one, but with the air of doing him an immense favour."
"As soon as she had gone Stepan Trofimovitch instantly sat down on the
sofa and made Sofya Matveyevna sit down beside him."
"There were several
arm-chairs as well as a sofa in the room, but they were of a most
uninviting appearance."
"The room was rather a large one, with a corner,
in which there was a bed, partitioned off."
"It was covered with old and
tattered yellow paper, and had horrible lithographs of mythological
subjects on the walls; in the corner facing the door there was a long
row of painted ikons and several sets of brass ones."
"The whole room with
its strangely ill-assorted furniture was an unattractive mixture of the
town element and of peasant traditions."
"But he did not even glance at it
all, nor look out of the window at the vast lake, the edge of which was
only seventy feet from the cottage."
"""At last we are by ourselves and we will admit no one!"
"I want to tell
you everything, everything from the very beginning."""
Sofya Matveyevna checked him with great uneasiness.
"""Are you aware, Stepan Trofimovitch?..."""
"_""Comment, vous savez déjà mon nom?"
"""_ He smiled with delight."
"""I heard it this morning from Anisim Ivanovitch when you were talking to
him."
"But I venture to tell you for my part...""

And she whispered hurriedly to him, looking nervously at the closed
door for fear anyone should overhear--that here in this village, it was
dreadful."
"That though all the peasants were fishermen, they made their
living chiefly by charging travellers every summer whatever they
thought fit."
"The village was not on the high road but an out-of-the-way
one, and people only called there because the steamers stopped there,
and that when the steamer did not call--and if the weather was in the
least unfavourable, it would not--then numbers of travellers would be
waiting there for several days, and all the cottages in the village
would be occupied, and that was just the villagers' opportunity, for
they charged three times its value for everything--and their landlord
here was proud and stuck up because he was, for these parts, very rich;
he had a net which had cost a thousand roubles."
"Stepan Trofimovitch looked almost reproachfully at Sofya Matveyevna's
extremely excited face, and several times he made a motion to stop her."
"But she persisted and said all she had to say: she said she had been
there before already in the summer ""with a very genteel lady from the
town,"" and stayed there too for two whole days till the steamer came,
and what they had to put up with did not bear thinking of."
"""Here, Stepan
Trofimovitch, you've been pleased to ask for this room for yourself
alone...."
I only speak to warn you....
"In the other room there are
travellers already."
"An elderly man and a young man and a lady with
children, and by to-morrow before two o'clock the whole house will be
filled up, for since the steamer hasn't been here for two days it will
be sure to come to-morrow."
"So for a room apart and for ordering dinner,
and for putting out the other travellers, they'll charge you a price
unheard of even in the capital....""

But he was in distress, in real distress."
"""_Assez, mon enfant,_ I beseech
you, _nous avons notre argent--et après, le bon Dieu._ And I am surprised
that, with the loftiness of your ideas, you... _Assez, assez, vous me
tourmentez,_"" he articulated hysterically, ""we have all our future before
us, and you... you fill me with alarm for the future."""
"He proceeded at once to unfold his whole story with such haste that at
first it was difficult to understand him."
It went on for a long time.
"The soup was served, the fowl was brought in, followed at last by the
samovar, and still he talked on."
"He told it somewhat strangely and
hysterically, and indeed he was ill."
"It was a sudden, extreme effort
of his intellectual faculties, which was bound in his overstrained
condition, of course--Sofya Matveyevna foresaw it with distress all
the time he was talking--to result immediately afterwards in extreme
exhaustion."
"He began his story almost with his childhood, when, ""with
fresh heart, he ran about the meadows; it was an hour before he reached
his two marriages and his life in Berlin."
"I dare not laugh, however."
"It
really was for him a matter of the utmost importance, and to adopt the
modern jargon, almost a question of struggling for existence."""
"He saw
before him the woman whom he had already elected to share his new life,
and was in haste to consecrate her, so to speak."
"His genius must not be
hidden from her.... Perhaps he had formed a very exaggerated estimate
of Sofya Matveyevna, but he had already chosen her."
"He could not exist
without a woman."
"He saw clearly from her face that she hardly understood
him, and could not grasp even the most essential part."
"""_Ce n'est rien,
nous attendrons,_ and meanwhile she can feel it intuitively.... My
friend, I need nothing but your heart!"""
"he exclaimed, interrupting his
narrative, ""and that sweet enchanting look with which you are gazing at
me now."
"Oh, don't blush!"
"I've told you already..."" The poor woman who
had fallen into his hands found much that was obscure, especially when
his autobiography almost passed into a complete dissertation on the fact
that no one had been ever able to understand Stepan Trofimovitch,
and that ""men of genius are wasted in Russia."""
"It was all ""so very
intellectual,"" she reported afterwards dejectedly."
"She listened in
evident misery, rather round-eyed."
"When Stepan Trofimovitch fell into
a humorous vein and threw off witty sarcasms at the expense of our
advanced and governing classes, she twice made grievous efforts to laugh
in response to his laughter, but the result was worse than tears, so
that Stepan Trofimovitch was at last embarrassed by it himself and
attacked ""the nihilists and modern people"" with all the greater wrath
and zest."
"At this point he simply alarmed her, and it was not until he
began upon the romance of his life that she felt some slight relief,
though that too was deceptive."
"A woman is always a woman even if she is
a nun."
"She smiled, shook her head and then blushed crimson and dropped
her eyes, which roused Stepan Trofimovitch to absolute ecstasy and
inspiration so much that he began fibbing freely."
"Varvara Petrovna
appeared in his story as an enchanting brunette (who had been the rage
of Petersburg and many European capitals) and her husband ""had been
struck down on the field of Sevastopol"" simply because he had felt
unworthy of her love, and had yielded her to his rival, that is, Stepan
Trofimovitch.... ""Don't be shocked, my gentle one, my Christian,"" he
exclaimed to Sofya Matveyevna, almost believing himself in all that he
was telling, ""it was something so lofty, so subtle, that we never spoke
of it to one another all our lives."""
"As the story went on, the cause
of this position of affairs appeared to be a blonde lady (if not Darya
Pavlovna I don't know of whom Stepan Trofimovitch could have been
thinking), this blonde owed everything to the brunette, and had grown up
in her house, being a distant relation."
"The brunette observing at last
the love of the blonde girl to Stepan Trofimovitch, kept her feelings
locked up in her heart."
"The blonde girl, noticing on her part the love
of the brunette to Stepan Trofimovitch, also locked her feelings in her
own heart."
"And all three, pining with mutual magnanimity, kept silent in
this way for twenty years, locking their feelings in their hearts."
"""Oh,
what a passion that was, what a passion that was!"""
"he exclaimed with a
stifled sob of genuine ecstasy."
"""I saw the full blooming of her beauty""
(of the brunette's, that is), ""I saw daily with an ache in my heart
how she passed by me as though ashamed she was so fair"" (once he said
""ashamed she was so fat"")."
"At last he had run away, casting off all this
feverish dream of twenty years--_vingt ans_--and now here he was on the
high road....

Then in a sort of delirium be began explaining to Sofya Matveyevna the
significance of their meeting that day, ""so chance an encounter and
so fateful for all eternity."""
"Sofya Matveyevna got up from the sofa in
terrible confusion at last."
"He had positively made an attempt to drop on
his knees before her, which made her cry."
It was beginning to get dark.
"They had been for some hours shut up in the room....

""No, you'd better let me go into the other room,"" she faltered, ""or else
there's no knowing what people may think....""

She tore herself away at last; he let her go, promising her to go to bed
at once."
As they parted he complained that he had a bad headache.
"Sofya
Matveyevna had on entering the cottage left her bag and things in the
first room, meaning to spend the night with the people of the house; but
she got no rest."
"In the night Stepan Trofimovitch was attacked by the malady with which
I and all his friends were so familiar--the summer cholera, which was
always the outcome of any nervous strain or moral shock with him."
"Poor
Sofya Matveyevna did not sleep all night."
"As in waiting on the invalid
she was obliged pretty often to go in and out of the cottage through the
landlady's room, the latter, as well as the travellers who were sleeping
there, grumbled and even began swearing when towards morning she set
about preparing the samovar."
"Stepan Trofimovitch was half unconscious
all through the attack; at times he had a vision of the samovar being
set, of someone giving him something to drink (raspberry tea), and
putting something warm to his stomach and his chest."
"But he felt almost
every instant that she was here, beside him; that it was she going out
and coming in, lifting him off the bed and settling him in it again."
"Towards three o'clock in the morning he began to be easier; he sat up,
put his legs out of bed and thinking of nothing he fell on the floor
at her feet."
"This was a very different matter from the kneeling of the
evening; he simply bowed down at her feet and kissed the hem of her
dress."
"""Don't, sir, I am not worth it,"" she faltered, trying to get him back on
to the bed."
"""My saviour,"" he cried, clasping his hands reverently before her."
"""_Vous
êtes noble comme une marquise!_ I--I am a wretch."
"Oh, I've been dishonest
all my life....""

""Calm yourself!"""
Sofya Matveyevna implored him.
"""It was all lies that I told you this evening--to glorify myself, to
make it splendid, from pure wantonness--all, all, every word, oh, I am a
wretch, I am a wretch!"""
"The first attack was succeeded in this way by a second--an attack
of hysterical remorse."
"I have mentioned these attacks already when I
described his letters to Varvara Petrovna."
"He suddenly recalled Lise
and their meeting the previous morning."
"""It was so awful, and there must
have been some disaster and I didn't ask, didn't find out!"
"I thought
only of myself."
"Oh, what's the matter with her?"
"Do you know what's the
matter with her?"""
he besought Sofya Matveyevna.
"Then he swore that ""he would never change,"" that he would go back to
her (that is, Varvara Petrovna)."
"""We"" (that is, he and Sofya Matveyevna)
""will go to her steps every day when she is getting into her carriage
for her morning drive, and we will watch her in secret.... Oh, I wish
her to smite me on the other cheek; it's a joy to wish it!"
"I shall turn
her my other cheek _comme dans votre livre!_ Only now for the first time
I understand what is meant by... turning the other cheek."
"I never
understood before!"""
"The two days that followed were among the most terrible in Sofya
Matveyevna's life; she remembers them with a shudder to this day."
"Stepan
Trofimovitch became so seriously ill that he could not go on board the
steamer, which on this occasion arrived punctually at two o'clock in the
afternoon."
"She could not bring herself to leave him alone, so she
did not leave for Spasov either."
"From her account he was positively
delighted at the steamer's going without him."
"""Well, that's a good thing, that's capital!"""
he muttered in his bed.
"""I've been afraid all the time that we should go."
"Here it's so nice,
better than anywhere.... You won't leave me?"
"Oh, you have not left me!"""
"It was by no means so nice ""here"", however."
"He did not care to hear of
her difficulties; his head was full of fancies and nothing else."
"He
looked upon his illness as something transitory, a trifling ailment, and
did not think about it at all; he thought of nothing but how they would
go and sell ""these books."""
He asked her to read him the gospel.
"""I haven't read it for a long time... in the original."
"Some one may ask
me about it and I shall make a mistake; I ought to prepare myself after
all."""
She sat down beside him and opened the book.
"""You read beautifully,"" he interrupted her after the first line."
"""I see,
I see I was not mistaken,"" he added obscurely but ecstatically."
"He was,
in fact, in a continual state of enthusiasm."
"She read the Sermon on the
Mount."
"""_Assez, assez, mon enfant,_ enough.... Don't you think that that is
enough?"""
And he closed his eyes helplessly.
"He was very weak, but had not yet
lost consciousness."
"Sofya Matveyevna was getting up, thinking that he
wanted to sleep."
But he stopped her.
"""My friend, I've been telling lies all my life."
"Even when I told the
truth I never spoke for the sake of the truth, but always for my own
sake."
"I knew it before, but I only see it now.... Oh, where are those
friends whom I have insulted with my friendship all my life?"
"And all,
all!"
"_Savez-vous..._ perhaps I am telling lies now; no doubt I am telling
lies now."
The worst of it is that I believe myself when I am lying.
"The
hardest thing in life is to live without telling lies... and without
believing in one's lies."
"Yes, yes, that's just it...."
"But wait a bit,
that can all come afterwards.... We'll be together, together,"" he added
enthusiastically."
"""Stepan Trofimovitch,"" Sofya Matveyevna asked timidly, ""hadn't I better
send to the town for the doctor?"""
He was tremendously taken aback.
"""What for?"
_Est-ce que je suis si malade?
"Mais rien de sérieux._ What need
have we of outsiders?"
"They may find, besides--and what will happen then?"
"No, no, no outsiders and we'll be together."""
"""Do you know,"" he said after a pause, ""read me something more, just the
first thing you come across."""
Sofya Matveyevna opened the Testament and began reading.
"""Wherever it opens, wherever it happens to open,"" he repeated."
"""'And unto the angel of the church of the Laodiceans...'""

""What's that?"
What is it?
"Where is that from?"""
"""It's from the Revelation."""
"""_Oh, je m'en souviens, oui, l'Apocalypse."
"Lisez, lisez,_ I am trying our
future fortunes by the book."
I want to know what has turned up.
"Read on
from there....""

  ""'And unto the angel of the church of the Laodiceans write: These things
  saith the Amen, the faithful and true witness, the beginning of the
  creation of God;

  ""'I know thy works, that thou art neither cold nor hot;
  I would thou wert cold or hot."
"""'So then because thou art lukewarm, and neither cold nor hot,
  I will spue thee out of my mouth."
"""'Because thou sayest, I am rich and increased with goods,
  and have need of nothing: and thou knowest not that thou art wretched,
  and miserable, and poor, and blind, and naked.'"""
"""That too... and that's in your book too!"""
"he exclaimed, with flashing
eyes and raising his head from the pillow."
"""I never knew that grand
passage!"
"You hear, better be cold, better be cold than lukewarm, than
only lukewarm."
"Oh, I'll prove it!"
"Only don't leave me, don't leave me
alone!"
"We'll prove it, we'll prove it!"""
"""I won't leave you, Stepan Trofimovitch."
"I'll never leave you!"""
"She took
his hand, pressed it in both of hers, and laid it against her heart,
looking at him with tears in her eyes."
"(""I felt very sorry for him at
that moment,"" she said, describing it afterwards.)"
His lips twitched convulsively.
"""But, Stepan Trofimovitch, what are we to do though?"
"Oughtn't we to let
some of your friends know, or perhaps your relations?"""
"But at that he was so dismayed that she was very sorry that she had
spoken of it again."
"Trembling and shaking, he besought her to fetch no
one, not to do anything."
"He kept insisting, ""No one, no one!"
"We'll be
alone, by ourselves, alone, _nous partirons ensemble._""

Another difficulty was that the people of the house too began to be
uneasy; they grumbled, and kept pestering Sofya Matveyevna."
"She paid
them and managed to let them see her money."
"This softened them for the
time, but the man insisted on seeing Stepan Trofimovitch's ""papers."""
The invalid pointed with a supercilious smile to his little bag.
"Sofya
Matveyevna found in it the certificate of his having resigned his post
at the university, or something of the kind, which had served him as
a passport all his life."
"The man persisted, and said that ""he must be
taken somewhere, because their house wasn't a hospital, and if he were
to die there might be a bother."
"We should have no end of trouble."""
"Sofya
Matveyevna tried to speak to him of the doctor, but it appeared that
sending to the town would cost so much that she had to give up all
idea of the doctor."
She returned in distress to her invalid.
"Stepan
Trofimovitch was getting weaker and weaker."
"""Now read me another passage.... About the pigs,"" he said suddenly."
"""What?"""
"asked Sofya Matveyevna, very much alarmed."
"""About the pigs... that's there too... _ces cochons._ I remember the
devils entered into swine and they all were drowned."
"You must read me
that; I'll tell you why afterwards."
I want to remember it word for word.
"I want it word for word."""
"Sofya Matveyevna knew the gospel well and at once found the passage in
St. Luke which I have chosen as the motto of my record."
"I quote it here
again:

  ""'And there was there one herd of many swine feeding on the mountain;
  and they besought him that he would suffer them to enter into them."
"And
  he suffered them."
"""'Then went the devils out of the man and entered into the swine;
  and the herd ran violently down a steep place into the lake, and were
  choked."
"""'When they that fed them saw what was done, they fled, and went and
  told it in the city and in the country."
"""'Then they went out to see what was done; and came to Jesus and found
  the man, out of whom the devils were departed, sitting at the feet of
  Jesus, clothed, and in his right mind; and they were afraid.'"""
"""My friend,"" said Stepan Trofimovitch in great excitement ""_savez-vous,_
that wonderful and... extraordinary passage has been a stumbling-block
to me all my life... _dans ce livre_.... so much so that I remembered
those verses from childhood."
"Now an idea has occurred to me; _une
comparaison._ A great number of ideas keep coming into my mind now."
"You
see, that's exactly like our Russia, those devils that come out of the
sick man and enter into the swine."
"They are all the sores, all the foul
contagions, all the impurities, all the devils great and small that have
multiplied in that great invalid, our beloved Russia, in the course of
ages and ages."
"_Oui, cette Russie que j'aimais toujours._ But a great
idea and a great Will will encompass it from on high, as with that
lunatic possessed of devils... and all those devils will come forth, all
the impurity, all the rottenness that was putrefying on the surface ...
and they will beg of themselves to enter into swine; and indeed maybe
they have entered into them already!"
"They are we, we and those... and
Petrusha and _les autres avec lui..._ and I perhaps at the head of them,
and we shall cast ourselves down, possessed and raving, from the rocks
into the sea, and we shall all be drowned--and a good thing too, for
that is all we are fit for."
"But the sick man will be healed and
'will sit at the feet of Jesus,' and all will look upon him with
astonishment.... My dear, _vous comprendrez après,_ but now it excites me
very much.... _Vous comprendrez après."
"Nous comprendrons ensemble._""

He sank into delirium and at last lost consciousness."
"So it went on all
the following day."
"Sofya Matveyevna sat beside him, crying."
"She scarcely
slept at all for three nights, and avoided seeing the people of the
house, who were, she felt, beginning to take some steps."
"Deliverance
only came on the third day."
"In the morning Stepan Trofimovitch returned
to consciousness, recognised her, and held out his hand to her."
"She
crossed herself hopefully."
He wanted to look out of the window.
"_""Tiens,
un lac!"
"""_ he said."
"""Good heavens, I had not seen it before!..."""
"At that
moment there was the rumble of a carriage at the cottage door and a
great hubbub in the house followed."
"III

It was Varvara Petrovna herself."
"She had arrived, with Darya Pavlovna,
in a closed carriage drawn by four horses, with two footmen."
"The marvel
had happened in the simplest way: Anisim, dying of curiosity, went to
Varvara Petrovna's the day after he reached the town and gossiped to
the servants, telling them he had met Stepan Trofimovitch alone in a
village, that the latter had been seen by peasants walking by himself
on the high road, and that he had set off for Spasov by way of Ustyevo
accompanied by Sofya Matveyevna."
"As Varvara Petrovna was, for her
part, in terrible anxiety and had done everything she could to find her
fugitive friend, she was at once told about Anisim."
"When she had heard
his story, especially the details of the departure for Ustyevo in a cart
in the company of some Sofya Matveyevna, she instantly got ready and set
off post-haste for Ustyevo herself."
"Her stern and peremptory voice resounded through the cottage; even the
landlord and his wife were intimidated."
"She had only stopped to question
them and make inquiries, being persuaded that Stepan Trofimovitch must
have reached Spasov long before."
"Learning that he was still here and
ill, she entered the cottage in great agitation."
"""Well, where is he?"
"Ah, that's you!"""
"she cried, seeing Sofya Matveyevna,
who appeared at that very instant in the doorway of the next room."
"""I
can guess from your shameless face that it's you."
"Go away, you vile
hussy!"
Don't let me find a trace of her in the house!
"Turn her out, or
else, my girl, I'll get you locked up for good."
"Keep her safe for a time
in another house."
"She's been in prison once already in the town; she can
go back there again."
"And you, my good man, don't dare to let anyone in
while I am here, I beg of you."
"I am Madame Stavrogin, and I'll take the
whole house."
"As for you, my dear, you'll have to give me a full account
of it all."""
The familiar sounds overwhelmed Stepan Trofimovitch.
"He began to
tremble."
But she had already stepped behind the screen.
"With flashing
eyes she drew up a chair with her foot, and, sinking back in it, she
shouted to Dasha:

""Go away for a time!"
Stay in the other room.
Why are you so inquisitive?
"And shut the door properly after you."""
"For some time she gazed in silence with a sort of predatory look into
his frightened face."
"""Well, how are you getting on, Stepan Trofimovitch?"
"So you've been
enjoying yourself?"""
broke from her with ferocious irony.
"_""Chère,""_ Stepan Trofimovitch faltered, not knowing what he was saying,
""I've learnt to know real life in Russia... _et je prêcherai l'Evangile._""

""Oh, shameless, ungrateful man!"""
"she wailed suddenly, clasping her
hands."
"""As though you had not disgraced me enough, you've taken up
with... oh, you shameless old reprobate!"""
"_""Chère...""_ His voice failed him and he could not articulate a syllable
but simply gazed with eyes wide with horror."
"""Who is she?"""
"""_C'est un ange; c'était plus qu'un ange pour moi._ She's been all
night... Oh, don't shout, don't frighten her, _chère, chère..._""

With a loud noise, Varvara Petrovna pushed back her chair, uttering a
loud cry of alarm."
"""Water, water!"""
"Though he returned to consciousness, she was still shaking with terror,
and, with pale cheeks, looked at his distorted face."
"It was only then,
for the first time, that she guessed the seriousness of his illness."
"""Darya,"" she whispered suddenly to Darya Pavlovna, ""send at once for the
doctor, for Salzfish; let Yegorytch go at once."
"Let him hire horses here
and get another carriage from the town."
"He must be here by night."""
Dasha flew to do her bidding.
"Stepan Trofimovitch still gazed at her
with the same wide-open, frightened eyes; his blanched lips quivered."
"""Wait a bit, Stepan Trofimovitch, wait a bit, my dear!"""
"she said,
coaxing him like a child."
"""There, there, wait a bit!"
"Darya will come
back and... My goodness, the landlady, the landlady, you come, anyway,
my good woman!"""
In her impatience she ran herself to the landlady.
"""Fetch that woman back at once, this minute."
"Bring her back, bring her
back!"""
"Fortunately Sofya Matveyevna had not yet had time to get away and was
only just going out of the gate with her pack and her bag."
"She was
brought back."
"She was so panic-stricken that she was trembling in every
limb."
"Varvara Petrovna pounced on her like a hawk on a chicken, seized
her by the hand and dragged her impulsively to Stepan Trofimovitch."
"""Here, here she is, then."
I've not eaten her.
"You thought I'd eaten
her."""
"Stepan Trofimovitch clutched Varvara Petrovna's hand, raised it to his
eyes, and burst into tears, sobbing violently and convulsively."
"""There, calm yourself, there, there, my dear, there, poor dear man!"
"Ach, mercy on us!"
"Calm yourself, will you?"""
she shouted frantically.
"""Oh, you bane of my life!"""
"""My dear,"" Stepan Trofimovitch murmured at last, addressing Sofya
Matveyevna, ""stay out there, my dear, I want to say something here....""

Sofya Matveyevna hurried out at once."
"_""Chérie... chérie...""_ he gasped."
"""Don't talk for a bit, Stepan Trofimovitch, wait a little till you've
rested."
Here's some water.
"Do wait, will you!"""
She sat down on the chair again.
"Stepan Trofimovitch held her hand
tight."
For a long while she would not allow him to speak.
"He raised her
hand to his lips and fell to kissing it."
"She set her teeth and looked
away into the corner of the room."
"_""Je vous aimais,""_ broke from him at last."
"She had never heard such words
from him, uttered in such a voice."
"""H'm!"""
she growled in response.
"_""Je vous aimais toute ma vie... vingt ans!"
"""_

She remained silent for two or three minutes."
"""And when you were getting yourself up for Dasha you sprinkled yourself
with scent,"" she said suddenly, in a terrible whisper."
Stepan Trofimovitch was dumbfounded.
"""You put on a new tie...""

Again silence for two minutes."
"""Do you remember the cigar?"""
"""My friend,"" he faltered, overcome with horror."
"""That cigar at the window in the evening... the moon was shining...
after the arbour... at Skvoreshniki?"
"Do you remember, do you remember?"""
"She jumped up from her place, seized his pillow by the corners and shook
it with his head on it."
"""Do you remember, you worthless, worthless,
ignoble, cowardly, worthless man, always worthless!"""
"she hissed in her
furious whisper, restraining herself from speaking loudly."
"At last
she left him and sank on the chair, covering her face with her hands."
"""Enough!"""
"she snapped out, drawing herself up."
"""Twenty years have
passed, there's no calling them back."
"I am a fool too."""
"_""Je vous aimais."
"""_ He clasped his hands again."
"""Why do you keep on with your _aimais_ and _aimais_?"
"Enough!"""
"she cried,
leaping up again."
"""And if you don't go to sleep at once I'll... You need
rest; go to sleep, go to sleep at once, shut your eyes."
"Ach, mercy on
us, perhaps he wants some lunch!"
What do you eat?
What does he eat?
"Ach,
mercy on us!"
Where is that woman?
"Where is she?"""
There was a general bustle again.
"But Stepan Trofimovitch faltered in a
weak voice that he really would like to go to sleep _une heure,_ and then
_un bouillon, un thé.... enfin il est si heureux._ He lay back and really
did seem to go to sleep (he probably pretended to)."
"Varvara Petrovna
waited a little, and stole out on tiptoe from behind the partition."
"She settled herself in the landlady's room, turned out the landlady and
her husband, and told Dasha to bring her _that_ woman."
"There followed an
examination in earnest."
"""Tell me all about it, my good girl."
Sit down beside me; that's right.
"Well?"""
"""I met Stepan Trofimovitch...""

""Stay, hold your tongue!"
"I warn you that if you tell lies or conceal
anything, I'll ferret it out."
"Well?"""
"""Stepan Trofimovitch and I... as soon as I came to Hatovo..."" Sofya
Matveyevna began almost breathlessly."
"""Stay, hold your tongue, wait a bit!"
Why do you gabble like that?
"To
begin with, what sort of creature are you?"""
"Sofya Matveyevna told her after a fashion, giving a very brief account
of herself, however, beginning with Sevastopol."
"Varvara Petrovna
listened in silence, sitting up erect in her chair, looking sternly
straight into the speaker's eyes."
"""Why are you so frightened?"
Why do you look at the ground?
"I like people
who look me straight in the face and hold their own with me."
"Go on."""
"She told of their meeting, of her books, of how Stepan Trofimovitch had
regaled the peasant woman with vodka... ""That's right, that's right,
don't leave out the slightest detail,"" Varvara Petrovna encouraged her."
"At last she described how they had set off, and how Stepan Trofimovitch
had gone on talking, ""really ill by that time,"" and here had given an
account of his life from the very beginning, talking for some hours."
"""Tell me about his life."""
Sofya Matveyevna suddenly stopped and was completely nonplussed.
"""I can't tell you anything about that, madam,"" she brought out, almost
crying; ""besides, I could hardly understand a word of it."""
"""Nonsense!"
"You must have understood something."""
"""He told a long time about a distinguished lady with black hair."""
"Sofya
Matveyevna flushed terribly though she noticed Varvara Petrovna's fair
hair and her complete dissimilarity with the ""brunette"" of the story."
"""Black-haired?"
What exactly?
"Come, speak!"""
"""How this grand lady was deeply in love with his honour all her life
long and for twenty years, but never dared to speak, and was shamefaced
before him because she was a very stout lady....""

""The fool!"""
Varvara Petrovna rapped out thoughtfully but resolutely.
Sofya Matveyevna was in tears by now.
"""I don't know how to tell any of it properly, madam, because I was in a
great fright over his honour; and I couldn't understand, as he is such
an intellectual gentleman."""
"""It's not for a goose like you to judge of his intellect."
"Did he offer
you his hand?"""
The speaker trembled.
"""Did he fall in love with you?"
Speak!
"Did he offer you his hand?"""
Varvara Petrovna shouted peremptorily.
"""That was pretty much how it was,"" she murmured tearfully."
"""But I took
it all to mean nothing, because of his illness,"" she added firmly,
raising her eyes."
"""What is your name?"""
"""Sofya Matveyevna, madam."""
"""Well, then, let me tell you, Sofya Matveyevna, that he is a wretched
and worthless little man.... Good Lord!"
"Do you look upon me as a wicked
woman?"""
Sofya Matveyevna gazed open-eyed.
"""A wicked woman, a tyrant?"
"Who has ruined his life?"""
"""How can that be when you are crying yourself, madam?"""
Varvara Petrovna actually had tears in her eyes.
"""Well, sit down, sit down, don't be frightened."
"Look me straight in the
face again."
Why are you blushing?
"Dasha, come here."
Look at her.
"What do
you think of her?"
"Her heart is pure....""

And to the amazement and perhaps still greater alarm of Sofya
Matveyevna, she suddenly patted her on the cheek."
"""It's only a pity she is a fool."
Too great a fool for her age.
"That's
all right, my dear, I'll look after you."
I see that it's all nonsense.
Stay near here for the time.
"A room shall be taken for you and you shall
have food and everything else from me... till I ask for you."""
Sofya Matveyevna stammered in alarm that she must hurry on.
"""You've no need to hurry."
"I'll buy all your books, and meantime you stay
here."
Hold your tongue; don't make excuses.
"If I hadn't come you would
have stayed with him all the same, wouldn't you?"""
"""I wouldn't have left him on any account,"" Sofya Matveyevna brought out
softly and firmly, wiping her tears."
It was late at night when Doctor Salzfish was brought.
"He was a very
respectable old man and a practitioner of fairly wide experience who had
recently lost his post in the service in consequence of some quarrel
on a point of honour with his superiors."
"Varvara Petrovna instantly
and actively took him under her protection."
"He examined the patient
attentively, questioned him, and cautiously pronounced to Varvara
Petrovna that ""the sufferer's"" condition was highly dubious in
consequence of complications, and that they must be prepared ""even for
the worst."""
"Varvara Petrovna, who had during twenty years got
accustomed to expecting nothing serious or decisive to come from Stepan
Trofimovitch, was deeply moved and even turned pale."
"""Is there really no
hope?"""
"""Can there ever be said to be absolutely no hope?"
"But..."" She did not go
to bed all night, and felt that the morning would never come."
"As soon
as the patient opened his eyes and returned to consciousness (he was
conscious all the time, however, though he was growing weaker every
hour), she went up to him with a very resolute air."
"""Stepan Trofimovitch, one must be prepared for anything."
"I've sent for a
priest."
"You must do what is right....""

Knowing his convictions, she was terribly afraid of his refusing."
"He
looked at her with surprise."
"""Nonsense, nonsense!"""
"she vociferated, thinking he was already refusing."
"""This is no time for whims."
"You have played the fool enough."""
"""But... am I really so ill, then?"""
He agreed thoughtfully.
"And indeed I was much surprised to learn from
Varvara Petrovna afterwards that he showed no fear of death at all."
"Possibly it was that he simply did not believe it, and still looked upon
his illness as a trifling one."
He confessed and took the sacrament very readily.
"Every one, Sofya
Matveyevna, and even the servants, came to congratulate him on taking
the sacrament."
"They were all moved to tears looking at his sunken and
exhausted face and his blanched and quivering lips."
"""_Oui, mes amis,_ and I only wonder that you... take so much trouble."
"I
shall most likely get up to-morrow, and we will... set off.... _Toute
cette cérémonie_... for which, of course, I feel every proper respect...
was...""

""I beg you, father, to remain with the invalid,"" said Varvara Petrovna
hurriedly, stopping the priest, who had already taken off his vestments."
"""As soon as tea has been handed, I beg you to begin to speak of
religion, to support his faith."""
The priest spoke; every one was standing or sitting round the sick-bed.
"""In our sinful days,"" the priest began smoothly, with a cup of tea in
his hand, ""faith in the Most High is the sole refuge of the race of man
in all the trials and tribulations of life, as well as its hope for that
eternal bliss promised to the righteous."""
"Stepan Trofimovitch seemed to revive, a subtle smile strayed on his
lips."
"_""Mon père, je vous remercie et vous êtes bien bon, mais...""_

""No _mais_ about it, no _mais_ at all!"""
"exclaimed Varvara Petrovna,
bounding up from her chair."
"""Father,"" she said, addressing the priest,
""he is a man who... he is a man who... You will have to confess him
again in another hour!"
"That's the sort of man he is."""
Stepan Trofimovitch smiled faintly.
"""My friends,"" he said, ""God is necessary to me, if only because He is
the only being whom one can love eternally."""
"Whether he was really converted, or whether the stately ceremony of
the administration of the sacrament had impressed him and stirred the
artistic responsiveness of his temperament or not, he firmly and, I
am told, with great feeling uttered some words which were in flat
contradiction with many of his former convictions."
"""My immortality is necessary if only because God will not be guilty
of injustice and extinguish altogether the flame of love for Him once
kindled in my heart."
And what is more precious than love?
"Love is higher
than existence, love is the crown of existence; and how is it possible
that existence should not be under its dominance?"
"If I have once loved
Him and rejoiced in my love, is it possible that He should extinguish me
and my joy and bring me to nothingness again?"
"If there is a God, then I
am immortal."
"_Voilà ma profession de foi._""

""There is a God, Stepan Trofimovitch, I assure you there is,"" Varvara
Petrovna implored him."
"""Give it up, drop all your foolishness for once
in your life!"""
"(I think she had not quite understood his _profession de
foi_.)"
"""My friend,"" he said, growing more and more animated, though his voice
broke frequently, ""as soon as I understood... that turning of the cheek,
I... understood something else as well."
"_J'ai menti toute ma vie,_ all my
life, all!"
"I should like... but that will do to-morrow.... To-morrow we
will all set out."""
Varvara Petrovna burst into tears.
He was looking about for someone.
"""Here she is, she is here!"""
"She seized Sofya Matveyevna by the hand and
led her to him."
He smiled tenderly.
"""Oh, I should dearly like to live again!"""
"he exclaimed with an
extraordinary rush of energy."
"""Every minute, every instant of life ought
to be a blessing to man... they ought to be, they certainly ought to be!"
"It's the duty of man to make it so; that's the law of his nature, which
always exists even if hidden.... Oh, I wish I could see Petrusha... and
all of them... Shatov...""

I may remark that as yet no one had heard of Shatov's fate--not Varvara
Petrovna nor Darya Pavlovna, nor even Salzfish, who was the last to come
from the town."
"Stepan Trofimovitch became more and more excited, feverishly so, beyond
his strength."
"""The mere fact of the ever present idea that there exists something
infinitely more just and more happy than I am fills me through and
through with tender ecstasy--and glorifies me--oh, whoever I may be,
whatever I have done!"
"What is far more essential for man than personal
happiness is to know and to believe at every instant that there is
somewhere a perfect and serene happiness for all men and for
everything...."
"The one essential condition of human existence is that
man should always be able to bow down before something infinitely great."
"If men are deprived of the infinitely great they will not go on living
and will die of despair."
"The Infinite and the Eternal are as essential
for man as the little planet on which he dwells."
"My friends, all, all:
hail to the Great Idea!"
"The Eternal, Infinite Idea!"
"It is essential to
every man, whoever he may be, to bow down before what is the Great Idea."
Even the stupidest man needs something great.
"Petrusha... oh, how I want
to see them all again!"
"They don't know, they don't know that that same
Eternal, Grand Idea lies in them all!"""
Doctor Salzfish was not present at the ceremony.
"Coming in suddenly, he
was horrified, and cleared the room, insisting that the patient must not
be excited."
"Stepan Trofimovitch died three days later, but by that time he was
completely unconscious."
"He quietly went out like a candle that is burnt
down."
"After having the funeral service performed, Varvara Petrovna
took the body of her poor friend to Skvoreshniki."
"His grave is in the
precincts of the church and is already covered with a marble slab."
"The
inscription and the railing will be added in the spring."
Varvara Petrovna's absence from town had lasted eight days.
"Sofya
Matveyevna arrived in the carriage with her and seems to have settled
with her for good."
"I may mention that as soon as Stepan Trofimovitch
lost consciousness (the morning that he received the sacrament) Varvara
Petrovna promptly asked Sofya Matveyevna to leave the cottage again, and
waited on the invalid herself unassisted to the end, but she sent for
her at once when he had breathed his last."
"Sofya Matveyevna was terribly
alarmed by Varvara Petrovna's proposition, or rather command, that she
should settle for good at Skvoreshniki, but the latter refused to listen
to her protests."
"""That's all nonsense!"
I will go with you to sell the gospel.
"I have no
one in the world now."""
"""You have a son, however,"" Salzfish observed."
"""I have no son!"""
"Varvara Petrovna snapped out--and it was like a
prophecy."
CHAPTER VIII.
"CONCLUSION

ALL THE CRIMES AND VILLAINIES THAT had been perpetrated were discovered
with extraordinary rapidity, much more quickly than Pyotr Stepanovitch
had expected."
"To begin with, the luckless Marya Ignatyevna waked up
before daybreak on the night of her husband's murder, missed him and
flew into indescribable agitation, not seeing him beside her."
"The woman
who had been hired by Anna Prohorovna, and was there for the night,
could not succeed in calming her, and as soon as it was daylight ran
to fetch Arina Prohorovna herself, assuring the invalid that the latter
knew where her husband was, and when he would be back."
"Meantime Arina
Prohorovna was in some anxiety too; she had already heard from her
husband of the deed perpetrated that night at Skvoreshniki."
"He had
returned home about eleven o'clock in a terrible state of mind and
body; wringing his hands, he flung himself face downwards on his bed and
shaking with convulsive sobs kept repeating, ""It's not right, it's not
right, it's not right at all!"""
"He ended, of course, by confessing it all
to Arina Prohorovna--but to no one else in the house."
"She left him on
his bed, sternly impressing upon him that ""if he must blubber he must do
it in his pillow so as not to be overheard, and that he would be a fool
if he showed any traces of it next day."""
"She felt somewhat anxious,
however, and began at once to clear things up in case of emergency;
she succeeded in hiding or completely destroying all suspicious papers,
books, manifestoes perhaps."
"At the same time she reflected that she, her
sister, her aunt, her sister-in-law the student, and perhaps even her
long-eared brother had really nothing much to be afraid of."
"When the
nurse ran to her in the morning she went without a second thought to
Marya Ignatyevna's."
"She was desperately anxious, moreover, to find out
whether what her husband had told her that night in a terrified and
frantic whisper, that was almost like delirium, was true--that is,
whether Pyotr Stepanovitch had been right in his reckoning that Kirillov
would sacrifice himself for the general benefit."
"But she arrived at Marya Ignatyevna's too late: when the latter had sent
off the woman and was left alone, she was unable to bear the suspense;
she got out of bed, and throwing round her the first garment she could
find, something very light and unsuitable for the weather, I believe,
she ran down to Kirillov's lodge herself, thinking that he perhaps would
be better able than anyone to tell her something about her husband."
"The
terrible effect on her of what she saw there may well be imagined."
"It
is remarkable that she did not read Kirillov's last letter, which lay
conspicuously on the table, overlooking it, of course, in her fright."
"She ran back to her room, snatched up her baby, and went with it out of
the house into the street."
"It was a damp morning, there was a fog."
She met no passers-by in such an out-of-the-way street.
"She ran on
breathless through the wet, cold mud, and at last began knocking at the
doors of the houses."
"In the first house no one came to the door, in the
second they were so long in coming that she gave it up impatiently and
began knocking at a third door."
"This was the house of a merchant called
Titov."
"Here she wailed and kept declaring incoherently that her husband
was murdered, causing a great flutter in the house."
"Something was
known about Shatov and his story in the Titov household; they were
horror-stricken that she should be running about the streets in such
attire and in such cold with the baby scarcely covered in her arms,
when, according to her story, she had only been confined the day before."
"They thought at first that she was delirious, especially as they could
not make out whether it was Kirillov who was murdered or her husband."
"Seeing that they did not believe her she would have run on farther,
but they kept her by force, and I am told she screamed and struggled
terribly."
"They went to Filipov's, and within two hours Kirillov's
suicide and the letter he had left were known to the whole town."
"The
police came to question Marya Ignatyevna, who was still conscious, and
it appeared at once that she had not read Kirillov's letter, and they
could not find out from her what had led her to conclude that her
husband had been murdered."
"She only screamed that if Kirillov was
murdered, then her husband was murdered, they were together."
"Towards
midday she sank into a state of unconsciousness from which she never
recovered, and she died three days later."
"The baby had caught cold and
died before her."
"Arina Prohorovna not finding Marya Ignatyevna and the baby, and guessing
something was wrong, was about to run home, but she checked herself at
the gate and sent the nurse to inquire of the gentleman at the lodge
whether Marya Ignatyevna was not there and whether he knew anything
about her."
The woman came back screaming frantically.
"Persuading her not
to scream and not to tell anyone by the time-honoured argument that ""she
would get into trouble,"" she stole out of the yard."
"It goes without saying that she was questioned the same morning as
having acted as midwife to Marya Ignatyevna; but they did not get much
out of her."
"She gave a very cool and sensible account of all she had
herself heard and seen at Shatov's, but as to what had happened she
declared that she knew nothing, and could not understand it."
It may well be imagined what an uproar there was in the town.
"A new
""sensation,"" another murder!"
"But there was another element in this
case: it was clear that a secret society of murderers, incendiaries, and
revolutionists did exist, did actually exist."
"Liza's terrible death, the
murder of Stavrogin's wife, Stavrogin himself, the fire, the ball for
the benefit of the governesses, the laxity of manners and morals in
Yulia Mihailovna's circle...."
"Even in the disappearance of Stepan
Trofimovitch people insisted on scenting a mystery."
"All sorts of things
were whispered about Nikolay Vsyevolodovitch."
"By the end of the day
people knew of Pyotr Stepanovitch's absence too, and, strange to say,
less was said of him than of anyone."
"What was talked of most all that
day was ""the senator."""
"There was a crowd almost all day at Filipov's
house."
The police certainly were led astray by Kirillov's letter.
"They
believed that Kirillov had murdered Shatov and had himself committed
suicide."
"Yet, though the authorities were thrown into perplexity,
they were not altogether hoodwinked."
"The word ""park,"" for instance, so
vaguely inserted in Kirillov's letter, did not puzzle anyone as Pyotr
Stepanovitch had expected it would."
"The police at once made a rush
for Skvoreshniki, not simply because it was the only park in the
neighbourhood but also led thither by a sort of instinct because all the
horrors of the last few days were connected directly or indirectly with
Skvoreshniki."
That at least is my theory.
"(I may remark that
Varvara Petrovna had driven off early that morning in chase of Stepan
Trofimovitch, and knew nothing of what had happened in the town.)"
The body was found in the pond that evening.
"What led to the discovery
of it was the finding of Shatov's cap at the scene of the murder, where
it had been with extraordinary carelessness overlooked by the murderers."
"The appearance of the body, the medical examination and certain
deductions from it roused immediate suspicions that Kirillov must have
had accomplices."
"It became evident that a secret society really did
exist of which Shatov and Kirillov were members and which was connected
with the manifestoes."
Who were these accomplices?
"No one even thought of
any member of the quintet that day."
"It was ascertained that Kirillov
had lived like a hermit, and in so complete a seclusion that it had been
possible, as stated in the letter, for Fedka to lodge with him for so
many days, even while an active search was being made for him."
"The chief
thing that worried every one was the impossibility of discovering a
connecting-link in this chaos."
"There is no saying what conclusions and what disconnected theories our
panic-stricken townspeople would have reached, if the whole mystery had
not been suddenly solved next day, thanks to Lyamshin."
He broke down.
"He behaved as even Pyotr Stepanovitch had towards the end
begun to fear he would."
"Left in charge of Tolkatchenko, and afterwards
of Erkel, he spent all the following day lying in his bed with his face
turned to the wall, apparently calm, not uttering a word, and scarcely
answering when he was spoken to."
"This is how it was that he heard
nothing all day of what was happening in the town."
"But Tolkatchenko,
who was very well informed about everything, took into his head by
the evening to throw up the task of watching Lyamshin which Pyotr
Stepanovitch had laid upon him, and left the town, that is, to put it
plainly, made his escape; the fact is, they lost their heads as Erkel
had predicted they would."
"I may mention, by the way, that Liputin had
disappeared the same day before twelve o'clock."
"But things fell out so
that his disappearance did not become known to the authorities till
the evening of the following day, when, the police went to question his
family, who were panic-stricken at his absence but kept quiet from fear
of consequences."
"But to return to Lyamshin: as soon as he was left alone
(Erkel had gone home earlier, relying on Tolkatchenko) he ran out of
his house, and, of course, very soon learned the position of affairs."
"Without even returning home he too tried to run away without knowing
where he was going."
"But the night was so dark and to escape was so
terrible and difficult, that after going through two or three streets,
he returned home and locked himself up for the whole night."
"I believe
that towards morning he attempted to commit suicide but did not succeed."
"He remained locked up till midday--and then suddenly he ran to the
authorities."
"He is said to have crawled on his knees, to have sobbed and
shrieked, to have kissed the floor crying out that he was not worthy to
kiss the boots of the officials standing before him."
"They soothed him,
were positively affable to him."
"His examination lasted, I am told, for
three hours."
"He confessed everything, everything, told every detail,
everything he knew, every point, anticipating their questions, hurried
to make a clean breast of it all, volunteering unnecessary information
without being asked."
"It turned out that he knew enough, and presented
things in a fairly true light: the tragedy of Shatov and Kirillov, the
fire, the death of the Lebyadkins, and the rest of it were relegated
to the background."
"Pyotr Stepanovitch, the secret society, the
organisation, and the network were put in the first place."
"When asked
what was the object of so many murders and scandals and dastardly
outrages, he answered with feverish haste that ""it was with the idea of
systematically undermining the foundations, systematically destroying
society and all principles; with the idea of nonplussing every one and
making hay of everything, and then, when society was tottering, sick
and out of joint, cynical and sceptical though filled with an intense
eagerness for self-preservation and for some guiding idea, suddenly to
seize it in their hands, raising the standard of revolt and relying on a
complete network of quintets, which were actively, meanwhile, gathering
recruits and seeking out the weak spots which could be attacked."""
"In conclusion, he said that here in our town Pyotr Stepanovitch had
organised only the first experiment in such systematic disorder, so to
speak, as a programme for further activity, and for all the quintets--and
that this was his own (Lyamshin's) idea, his own theory, ""and that he
hoped they would remember it and bear in mind how openly and properly
he had given his information, and therefore might be of use hereafter."""
"Being asked definitely how many quintets there were, he answered that
there were immense numbers of them, that all Russia was overspread with
a network, and although he brought forward no proofs, I believe his
answer was perfectly sincere."
"He produced only the programme of the
society, printed abroad, and the plan for developing a system of future
activity roughly sketched in Pyotr Stepanovitch's own handwriting."
"It
appeared that Lyamshin had quoted the phrase about ""undermining the
foundation,"" word for word from this document, not omitting a single
stop or comma, though he had declared that it was all his own theory."
"Of Yulia Mihailovna he very funnily and quite without provocation
volunteered the remark, that ""she was innocent and had been made a
fool of."""
"But, strange to say, he exonerated Nikolay Stavrogin from
all share in the secret society, from any collaboration with Pyotr
Stepanovitch."
"(Lyamshin had no conception of the secret and very absurd
hopes that Pyotr Stepanovitch was resting on Stavrogin.)"
"According to
his story Nikolay Stavrogin had nothing whatever to do with the death of
the Lebyadkins, which had been planned by Pyotr Stepanovitch alone
and with the subtle aim of implicating the former in the crime, and
therefore making him dependent on Pyotr Stepanovitch; but instead of
the gratitude on which Pyotr Stepanovitch had reckoned with shallow
confidence, he had roused nothing but indignation and even despair in
""the generous heart of Nikolay Vsyevolodovitch."""
"He wound up, by a hint,
evidently intentional, volunteered hastily, that Stavrogin was perhaps
a very important personage, but that there was some secret about that,
that he had been living among us, so to say, incognito, that he had some
commission, and that very possibly he would come back to us again
from Petersburg."
"(Lyamshin was convinced that Stavrogin had gone
to Petersburg), but in quite a different capacity and in different
surroundings, in the suite of persons of whom perhaps we should soon
hear, and that all this he had heard from Pyotr Stepanovitch, ""Nikolay
Vsyevolodovitch's secret enemy."""
"Here I will note that two months later, Lyamshin admitted that he had
exonerated Stavrogin on purpose, hoping that he would protect him and
would obtain for him a mitigation in the second degree of his sentence,
and that he would provide him with money and letters of introduction
in Siberia."
"From this confession it is evident that he had an
extraordinarily exaggerated conception of Stavrogin's powers."
"On the same day, of course, the police arrested Virginsky and in their
zeal took his whole family too."
"(Arina Prohorovna, her sister, aunt, and
even the girl student were released long ago; they say that Shigalov too
will be set free very shortly because he cannot be classed with any of
the other prisoners."
But all that is so far only gossip.)
"Virginsky at
once pleaded guilty."
He was lying ill with fever when he was arrested.
"I am told that he seemed almost relieved; ""it was a load off his heart,""
he is reported to have said."
"It is rumoured that he is giving his
evidence without reservation, but with a certain dignity, and has not
given up any of his ""bright hopes,"" though at the same time he curses
the political method (as opposed to the Socialist one), in which he
had been unwittingly and heedlessly carried ""by the vortex of combined
circumstances."""
"His conduct at the time of the murder has been put in
a favourable light, and I imagine that he too may reckon on some
mitigation of his sentence."
"That at least is what is asserted in the
town."
But I doubt whether there is any hope for mercy in Erkel's case.
"Ever
since his arrest he has been obstinately silent, or has misrepresented
the facts as far as he could."
"Not one word of regret has been wrung
from him so far."
"Yet even the sternest of the judges trying him has
been moved to some compassion by his youth, by his helplessness, by the
unmistakable evidence that he is nothing but a fanatical victim of a
political impostor, and, most of all, by his conduct to his mother,
to whom, as it appears, he used to send almost the half of his small
salary."
"His mother is now in the town; she is a delicate and ailing
woman, aged beyond her years; she weeps and positively grovels on the
ground imploring mercy for her son."
"Whatever may happen, many among us
feel sorry for Erkel."
"Liputin was arrested in Petersburg, where he had been living for a
fortnight."
"His conduct there sounds almost incredible and is difficult
to explain."
"He is said to have had a passport in a forged name and quite
a large sum of money upon him, and had every possibility of escaping
abroad, yet instead of going he remained in Petersburg."
"He spent some
time hunting for Stavrogin and Pyotr Stepanovitch."
"Suddenly he took to
drinking and gave himself up to a debauchery that exceeded all bounds,
like a man who had lost all reason and understanding of his position."
"He
was arrested in Petersburg drunk in a brothel."
"There is a rumour that he
has not by any means lost heart, that he tells lies in his evidence and
is preparing for the approaching trial hopefully (?)"
"and, as it
were, triumphantly."
He even intends to make a speech at the trial.
"Tolkatchenko, who was arrested in the neighbourhood ten days after his
flight, behaves with incomparably more decorum; he does not shuffle
or tell lies, he tells all he knows, does not justify himself, blames
himself with all modesty, though he, too, has a weakness for rhetoric;
he tells readily what he knows, and when knowledge of the peasantry and
the revolutionary elements among them is touched upon, he positively
attitudinises and is eager to produce an effect."
"He, too, is meaning, I
am told, to make a speech at the trial."
"Neither he nor Liputin seem very
much afraid, curious as it seems."
I repeat that the case is not yet over.
"Now, three months afterwards,
local society has had time to rest, has recovered, has got over it, has
an opinion of its own, so much so that some people positively look
upon Pyotr Stepanovitch as a genius or at least as possessed of ""some
characteristics of a genius."""
"""Organisation!"""
"they say at the club,
holding up a finger."
"But all this is very innocent and there are not
many people who talk like that."
"Others, on the other hand, do not deny
his acuteness, but point out that he was utterly ignorant of real life,
that he was terribly theoretical, grotesquely and stupidly one-sided,
and consequently shallow in the extreme."
"As for his moral qualities all
are agreed; about that there are no two opinions."
I do not know whom to mention next so as not to forget anyone.
"Mavriky
Nikolaevitch has gone away for good, I don't know where."
"Old Madame
Drozdov has sunk into dotage...."
"I have still one very gloomy story to
tell, however."
I will confine myself to the bare facts.
"On her return from Ustyevo, Varvara Petrovna stayed at her town house."
"All the accumulated news broke upon her at once and gave her a terrible
shock."
She shut herself up alone.
"It was evening; every one was tired
and went to bed early."
"In the morning a maid with a mysterious air handed a note to Darya
Pavlovna."
"The note had, so she said, arrived the evening before, but
late, when all had gone to bed, so that she had not ventured to wake
her."
"It had not come by post, but had been put in Alexey Yegorytch's
hand in Skvoreshniki by some unknown person."
"And Alexey Yegorytch had
immediately set off and put it into her hands himself and had then
returned to Skvoreshniki."
"For a long while Darya Pavlovna gazed at the letter with a beating
heart, and dared not open it."
"She knew from whom it came: the writer was
Nikolay Stavrogin."
"She read what was written on the envelope: ""To Alexey
Yegorytch, to be given secretly to Darya Pavlovna."""
"Here is the letter word for word, without the slightest correction of
the defects in style of a Russian aristocrat who had never mastered the
Russian grammar in spite of his European education."
"""Dear Darya Pavlovna,--At one time you expressed a wish to be my nurse
and made me promise to send for you when I wanted you."
"I am going away
in two days and shall not come back."
Will you go with me?
"""Last year, like Herzen, I was naturalised as a citizen of the canton
of Uri, and that nobody knows."
There I've already bought a little house.
"I've still twelve thousand roubles left; we'll go and live there for
ever."
I don't want to go anywhere else ever.
"""It's a very dull place, a narrow valley, the mountains restrict both
vision and thought."
It's very gloomy.
"I chose the place because there
was a little house to be sold."
"If you don't like it I'll sell it and buy
another in some other place."
"""I am not well, but I hope to get rid of hallucinations in that air."
"It's physical, and as for the moral you know everything; but do you know
all?"
"""I've told you a great deal of my life, but not all."
Even to you!
Not all.
"By the way, I repeat that in my conscience I feel myself
responsible for my wife's death."
"I haven't seen you since then, that's
why I repeat it."
"I feel guilty about Lizaveta Nikolaevna too; but you
know about that; you foretold almost all that."
"""Better not come to me."
My asking you to is a horrible meanness.
"And why
should you bury your life with me?"
"You are dear to me, and when I was
miserable it was good to be beside you; only with you I could speak
of myself aloud."
But that proves nothing.
"You defined it yourself, 'a
nurse'--it's your own expression; why sacrifice so much?"
"Grasp this,
too, that I have no pity for you since I ask you, and no respect for
you since I reckon on you."
And yet I ask you and I reckon on you.
"In
any case I need your answer for I must set off very soon."
"In that case I
shall go alone."
"""I expect nothing of Uri; I am simply going."
"I have not chosen a gloomy
place on purpose."
"I have no ties in Russia--everything is as alien to
me there as everywhere."
"It's true that I dislike living there more than
anywhere; but I can't hate anything even there!"
"""I've tried my strength everywhere."
"You advised me to do this 'that I
might learn to know myself.'"
"As long as I was experimenting for myself
and for others it seemed infinite, as it has all my life."
"Before your
eyes I endured a blow from your brother; I acknowledged my marriage in
public."
"But to what to apply my strength, that is what I've never seen,
and do not see now in spite of all your praises in Switzerland, which
I believed in."
"I am still capable, as I always was, of desiring to do
something good, and of feeling pleasure from it; at the same time I
desire evil and feel pleasure from that too."
"But both feelings are
always too petty, and are never very strong."
"My desires are too weak;
they are not enough to guide me."
"On a log one may cross a river but not
on a chip."
"I say this that you may not believe that I am going to Uri
with hopes of any sort."
"""As always I blame no one."
"I've tried the depths of debauchery and
wasted my strength over it."
But I don't like vice and I didn't want it.
You have been watching me of late.
"Do you know that I looked upon our
iconoclasts with spite, from envy of their hopes?"
"But you had no need to
be afraid."
"I could not have been one of them for I never shared anything
with them."
"And to do it for fun, from spite I could not either, not
because I am afraid of the ridiculous--I cannot be afraid of the
ridiculous--but because I have, after all, the habits of a gentleman and
it disgusted me."
"But if I had felt more spite and envy of them I might
perhaps have joined them."
"You can judge how hard it has been for me, and
how I've struggled from one thing to another."
"""Dear friend!"
Great and tender heart which I divined!
"Perhaps you dream
of giving me so much love and lavishing on me so much that is beautiful
from your beautiful soul, that you hope to set up some aim for me at
last by it?"
"No, it's better for you to be more cautious, my love will
be as petty as I am myself and you will be unhappy."
"Your brother told me
that the man who loses connection with his country loses his gods, that
is, all his aims."
"One may argue about everything endlessly, but from me
nothing has come but negation, with no greatness of soul, no force."
Even negation has not come from me.
"Everything has always been petty and
spiritless."
"Kirillov, in the greatness of his soul, could not compromise
with an idea, and shot himself; but I see, of course, that he was
great-souled because he had lost his reason."
"I can never lose my reason,
and I can never believe in an idea to such a degree as he did."
"I cannot
even be interested in an idea to such a degree."
"I can never, never shoot
myself."
"""I know I ought to kill myself, to brush myself off the earth like a
nasty insect; but I am afraid of suicide, for I am afraid of showing
greatness of soul."
"I know that it will be another sham again--the last
deception in an endless series of deceptions."
"What good is there in
deceiving oneself?"
Simply to play at greatness of soul?
"Indignation and
shame I can never feel, therefore not despair."
"""Forgive me for writing so much."
I wrote without noticing.
"A hundred
pages would be too little and ten lines would be enough."
"Ten lines would
be enough to ask you to be a nurse."
"Since I left Skvoreshniki I've been
living at the sixth station on the line, at the stationmaster's."
"I got
to know him in the time of debauchery five years ago in Petersburg."
"No
one knows I am living there."
Write to him.
I enclose the address.
"""Nikolay Stavrogin."""
Darya Pavlovna went at once and showed the letter to Varvara Petrovna.
"She read it and asked Dasha to go out of the room so that she might read
it again alone; but she called her back very quickly."
"""Are you going?"""
she asked almost timidly.
"""I am going,"" answered Dasha."
"""Get ready!"
"We'll go together."""
Dasha looked at her inquiringly.
"""What is there left for me to do here?"
What difficulty will it make?
"I'll be naturalised in Uri, too, and live in the valley.... Don't be
uneasy, I won't be in the way."""
They began packing quickly to be in time to catch the midday train.
"But in less than half an hour's time Alexey Yegorytch arrived from
Skvoreshniki."
"He announced that Nikolay Vsyevolodovitch had suddenly
arrived that morning by the early train, and was now at Skvoreshniki but
""in such a state that his honour did not answer any questions, walked
through all the rooms and shut himself up in his own wing....""

""Though I received no orders I thought it best to come and inform you,""
Alexey Yegorytch concluded with a very significant expression."
Varvara Petrovna looked at him searchingly and did not question him.
"The
carriage was got ready instantly."
Varvara Petrovna set off with Dasha.
They say that she kept crossing herself on the journey.
"In Nikolay Vsyevolodovitch's wing of the house all the doors were open
and he was nowhere to be seen."
"""Wouldn't he be upstairs?"""
Fomushka ventured.
"It was remarkable that several servants followed Varvara Petrovna while
the others all stood waiting in the drawing-room."
"They would never have
dared to commit such a breach of etiquette before."
"Varvara Petrovna saw
it and said nothing."
They went upstairs.
"There there were three rooms; but they found no one
there."
"""Wouldn't his honour have gone up there?"""
"someone suggested, pointing
to the door of the loft."
"And in fact, the door of the loft which was
always closed had been opened and was standing ajar."
"The loft was right
under the roof and was reached by a long, very steep and narrow wooden
ladder."
There was a sort of little room up there too.
"""I am not going up there."
"Why should he go up there?"""
"said Varvara
Petrovna, turning terribly pale as she looked at the servants."
"They
gazed back at her and said nothing."
Dasha was trembling.
"Varvara Petrovna rushed up the ladder; Dasha followed, but she had
hardly entered the loft when she uttered a scream and fell senseless."
The citizen of the canton of Uri was hanging there behind the door.
"On
the table lay a piece of paper with the words in pencil: ""No one is to
blame, I did it myself."""
"Beside it on the table lay a hammer, a piece
of soap, and a large nail--obviously an extra one in case of need."
"The
strong silk cord upon which Nikolay Vsyevolodovitch had hanged himself
had evidently been chosen and prepared beforehand and was thickly
smeared with soap."
"Everything proved that there had been premeditation
and consciousness up to the last moment."
"At the inquest our doctors absolutely and emphatically rejected all idea
of insanity."
