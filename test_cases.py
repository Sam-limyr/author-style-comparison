    """‘When he
    bought the house, he liked to think that there were rooks about it.’

    The evening wind made such a disturbance just now, among some tall old
    elm-trees at the bottom of the garden, that neither my mother nor Miss
    Betsey could forbear glancing that way.
    As the elms bent to one another,
    like giants who were whispering secrets, and after a few seconds of such
    repose, fell into a violent flurry, tossing their wild arms about, as if
    their late confidences were really too wicked for their peace of mind,
    some weatherbeaten ragged old rooks’-nests, burdening their higher
    branches, swung like wrecks upon a stormy sea.
    ‘Where are the birds?’ asked Miss Betsey.
    ‘The--?’ My mother had been thinking of something else.
    ‘The rooks--what has become of them?’ asked Miss Betsey.
    ‘There have not been any since we have lived here,’ said my mother.""",

    """When I got to the office, and, shutting out old Tiffey and the rest of
    them with my hands, sat at my desk, in my own particular nook, thinking
    of this earthquake that had taken place so unexpectedly, and in the
    bitterness of my spirit cursing Jip, I fell into such a state of torment
    about Dora, that I wonder I did not take up my hat and rush insanely to
    Norwood.
    The idea of their frightening her, and making her cry, and of
    my not being there to comfort her, was so excruciating, that it impelled
    me to write a wild letter to Mr. Spenlow, beseeching him not to visit
    upon her the consequences of my awful destiny.
    I implored him to spare
    her gentle nature--not to crush a fragile flower--and addressed him
    generally, to the best of my remembrance, as if, instead of being her
    father, he had been an Ogre, or the Dragon of Wantley.
    This letter I
    sealed and laid upon his desk before he returned; and when he came in,
    I saw him, through the half-opened door of his room, take it up and read
    it.
    He said nothing about it all the morning; but before he went away in the
    afternoon he called me in, and told me that I need not make myself at
    all uneasy about his daughter’s happiness.
    He had assured her, he said,
    that it was all nonsense; and he had nothing more to say to her.""",

    """I received this letter by the post on Monday morning, and therefore its
    appointment was for next day.
    Let me confess exactly with what feelings
    I looked forward to Joe’s coming.
    Not with pleasure, though I was bound to him by so many ties; no; with
    considerable disturbance, some mortification, and a keen sense of
    incongruity.
    If I could have kept him away by paying money, I certainly
    would have paid money.
    My greatest reassurance was that he was coming
    to Barnard’s Inn, not to Hammersmith, and consequently would not fall
    in Bentley Drummle’s way.
    I had little objection to his being seen by
    Herbert or his father, for both of whom I had a respect; but I had the
    sharpest sensitiveness as to his being seen by Drummle, whom I held in
    contempt.
    So, throughout life, our worst weaknesses and meannesses are
    usually committed for the sake of the people whom we most despise.
    I had begun to be always decorating the chambers in some quite
    unnecessary and inappropriate way or other, and very expensive those
    wrestles with Barnard proved to be.""",

    """As it would be, by no means, seemly in a humble author to keep so
    mighty a personage as a beadle waiting, with his back to the fire, and
    the skirts of his coat gathered up under his arms, until such time as
    it might suit his pleasure to relieve him; and as it would still less
    become his station, or his gallantry to involve in the same neglect a
    lady on whom that beadle had looked with an eye of tenderness and
    affection, and in whose ear he had whispered sweet words, which, coming
    from such a quarter, might well thrill the bosom of maid or matron of
    whatsoever degree; the historian whose pen traces these words—trusting
    that he knows his place, and that he entertains a becoming reverence
    for those upon earth to whom high and important authority is
    delegated—hastens to pay them that respect which their position
    demands, and to treat them with all that duteous ceremony which their
    exalted rank, and (by consequence) great virtues, imperatively claim at
    his hands.
    Towards this end, indeed, he had purposed to introduce, in
    this place, a dissertation touching the divine right of beadles, and
    elucidative of the position, that a beadle can do no wrong: which could
    not fail to have been both pleasurable and profitable to the
    right-minded reader but which he is unfortunately compelled, by want of
    time and space, to postpone to some more convenient and fitting
    opportunity; on the arrival of which, he will be prepared to show, that
    a beadle properly constituted: that is to say, a parochial beadle,
    attached to a parochial workhouse, and attending in his official
    capacity the parochial church: is, in right and virtue of his office,
    possessed of all the excellences and best qualities of humanity; and
    that to none of those excellences, can mere companies’ beadles, or
    court-of-law beadles, or even chapel-of-ease beadles (save the last,
    and they in a very lowly and inferior degree), lay the remotest
    sustainable claim.""",

    """“If you could say, with truth, to your own solitary heart, to-night,

    respect, of no human creature; I have won myself a tender place in no
    regard; I have done nothing good or serviceable to be remembered by!’
    your seventy-eight years would be seventy-eight heavy curses; would they
    not?”
    
    “You say truly, Mr. Carton; I think they would be.”
    
    Sydney turned his eyes again upon the fire, and, after a silence of a
    few moments, said:
    
    “I should like to ask you:--Does your childhood seem far off?
    Do the
    days when you sat at your mother’s knee, seem days of very long ago?”
    
    Responding to his softened manner, Mr. Lorry answered:
    
    “Twenty years back, yes; at this time of my life, no.
    For, as I draw
    closer and closer to the end, I travel in the circle, nearer and

    apparently the result of a moment’s absence of mind, not worth remark.
    But as the words were uttered, Lord George, who had been going on

    sought to pierce, of the shrill cries of children at their evening
    sports, the distant hum and turmoil of the town, the cheerful country
    breath that rustled past to meet it, and to droop, and die; he watched,
    and watched, till it was dark save for the specks of light that twinkled
    in the streets below and far away--and, as the darkness deepened,

    distracted times, that more than the stirring incidents of a whole life
    often become compressed into the compass of four-and-twenty hours--on
    that same night, Mr Haredale, having strongly bound his prisoner,
    with the assistance of the sexton, and forced him to mount his horse,
    conducted him to Chigwell; bent upon procuring a conveyance to London
    from that place, and carrying him at once before a justice. The
    disturbed state of the town would be, he knew, a sufficient reason for
    demanding the murderer’s committal to prison before daybreak, as no man
    could answer for the security of any of the watch-houses or ordinary
    places of detention; and to convey a prisoner through the streets when
    the mob were again abroad, would not only be a task of great danger and
    hazard, but would be to challenge an attempt at rescue. Directing the
    sexton to lead the horse, he walked close by the murderer’s side, and in
    this order they reached the village about the middle of the night.""",

    friend who knew me when I was a girl, will you, dear Joe?’
    
    Well, well! It don’t matter what Joe said in answer, but he said a great
    deal; and Dolly said a great deal too: and he folded Dolly in his one
    arm pretty tight, considering that it was but one; and Dolly made no
    resistance: and if ever two people were happy in this world--which is
    not an utterly miserable one, with all its faults--we may, with some
    appearance of certainty, conclude that they were.""",

    still less use, Gay, if you persist in forcing Mr John Carker’s name on
    people’s attention. That is not the way to befriend Mr John Carker. Ask
    him if he thinks it is.’

    to surprise, ‘who may have abused your ear with such representations;

    have been trying me, and tampering with me, I am now sure. You have a

    herself is next handed in, and grimly takes her seat. There is a snaky
    gleam in her hard grey eye, as of anticipated rounds of buttered toast,
    relays of hot chops, worryings and quellings of young children, sharp
    snappings at poor Berry, and all the other delights of her Ogress’s
    castle. Mrs Pipchin almost laughs as the fly-van drives off, and she
    composes her black bombazeen skirts, and settles herself among the

    Tom little thought how natural it was. Tom little knew that there was
    that in Ruth’s own heart, but newly set there, which had helped her to
    the reading of his mystery. Ah, Tom! He didn’t understand the whispers
    of the Temple Fountain, though he passed it every day.

    sort of thing, isn’t it, that you should have been left here, all these
    years, and no money paid after the first six--nor no notice taken, nor
    no clue to be got who you belong to? It’s a pretty sort of thing that I
    should have to feed a great fellow like you, and never hope to get one
    penny for it, isn’t it?’

    Nickleby, to convert the papers I have spoken of, into money, and as you
    have assisted us very often before, and are very much connected with us
    in this kind of matters, I wish you to know the determination at which

    have told--drive there! There’s mischief in it. There must be.’

    highest that Mr. Nickleby could go.’ Being answered in the affirmative,
    he became restless again, and, after some thought, and an unsuccessful
    inquiry ‘whether he couldn’t go another fifty,’ said he supposed he must
    try and do the most he could for a friend: which was always his maxim,

    Willy is in Heaven now, and that it’s always summer there, and yet I’m
    sure he grieves when I lie down upon his garden bed, and he cannot turn
    to kiss me.  But if you do go, Nell,’ said the boy, caressing her, and
    pressing his face to hers, ‘be fond of him for my sake.  Tell him how I

    ever received at the hands of any party; it was a sufficiently humble
    one, but it was a recognition of his début into the town's life and
    activities at last; it was a step upward, and he was deeply gratified.
    He accepted, and the committee departed, followed by young Tom.""",

    """"Tryin' ain't de thing. You's gwyne to do it. You ain't gwyne to steal a
    pin--'ca'se it ain't safe no mo'; en you ain't gwyne into no bad
    comp'ny--not even once, you understand; en you ain't gwyne to drink a
    drop--nary single drop; en you ain't gwyne to gamble one single
    gamble--not one! Dis ain't what you's gwyne to try to do, it's what
    you's gwyne to do. En I'll tell you how I knows it. Dis is how. I's
    gwyne to foller along to Sent Louis my own self; en you's gwyne to come
    to me every day o' yo' life, en I'll look you over; en if you fails in
    one single one o' dem things--jist one--I take my oath I'll come
    straight down to dis town en tell de Jedge you's a nigger en a slave--en
    prove it!" She paused to let her words sink home. Then she added,
    "Chambers, does you b'lieve me when I says dat?" """,

    """He did not want to
    commit this treachery, but luck threw the man in his way, and this saved
    him the necessity of going up country to hunt up a purchaser, with the
    added risk of having to answer a lot of questions, whereas this planter
    was so pleased with Roxy that he asked next to none at all. Besides, the
    planter insisted that Roxy wouldn't know where she was, at first, and
    that by the time she found out she would already have become contented.
    And Tom argued with himself that it was an immense advantage for Roxy to
    have a master who was so pleased with her, as this planter manifestly
    was. In almost no time his flowing reasonings carried him to the point
    of even half believing he was doing Roxy a splendid surreptitious
    service in selling her "down the river." """,

    """They were not followed. Tom trembled every time a late straggler brushed
    by them on the street, and half expected to feel the cold steel in his
    back. Roxy was right at his heels and always in reach. After tramping a
    mile they reached a wide vacancy on the deserted wharves, and in this
    dark and rainy desert they parted.
    
    As Tom trudged home his mind was full of dreary thoughts and wild plans;
    but at last he said to himself, wearily--
    
    "There is but the one way out. I must follow her plan. But with a
    variation--I will not ask for the money and ruin myself; I will rob the
    old skinflint." """,

    """As to the mysterious girl, Tom swore he knew no such girl, and did not
    remember ever seeing a girl wearing a dress like the one described by
    Wilson. He admitted that he did not always lock his room, and that
    sometimes the servants forgot to lock the house doors; still, in his
    opinion the girl must have made but few visits or she would have been
    discovered. When Wilson tried to connect her with the stealing-raid, and
    thought she might have been the old woman's confederate, if not the very
    thief herself disguised as an old woman, Tom seemed stuck, and also much
    interested, and said he would keep a sharp eye out for this person or
    persons, although he was afraid that she or they would be too smart to
    venture again into a town where everybody would now be on the watch for
    a good while to come.""",

    """In that case he would retain the knife in his possession, not
    daring to offer it for sale, or for pledge in a pawn-shop. [There was a
    nodding of heads among the audience by way of admission that this was
    not a bad stroke.] I shall prove to the satisfaction of the jury that
    there was a person in Judge Driscoll's room several minutes before the
    accused entered it. [This produced a strong sensation; the last
    drowsy-head in the court-room roused up, now, and made preparation to
    listen.] If it shall seem necessary, I will prove by the Misses Clarkson
    that they met a veiled person--ostensibly a woman--coming out of the
    back gate a few minutes after the cry for help was heard. This person
    was not a woman, but a man dressed in woman's clothes." """,
